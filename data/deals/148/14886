nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This should be fun for me, I have played with Mike Passell and Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome everyone |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am currently writing a book with Boye Brogeland, so I hope for some great hand in this set that we can use in the book.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They are both marvelous players, that make you feel like you are relaxing in a rocking chair|pg||
nt|po-s: strange! Duboin-Sementa not playing. Probably one of them must be ill.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Sergey, David and Al|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to New Orleans |pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Not if you are playing against them!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to New orleans|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all welcome|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another close match tonight|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Frank |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfe: Hey guys, welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Cayne and Seamon to the best of my knowledge play 2/1 with fairly sound openng bids; Diamond-Platnick I believe play a highly scientific strong club system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1st 6 boards had already been compared with blistering score of 3-0 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll play 10 boards from this new set of boards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: welcome also to Frank Budai, Australia   (rejoining us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh they changed names,  skip previous comment |pg||
nt|casenjo:  transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome also to Harmon Edgar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hey guys|pg||
nt|frankaus: anther imp each and it will be real close :)|pg||
nt|harmon: hi everyone|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs and South will have two possible responses: 2NT and 3@C. 2NT would indicate a good fit for clubs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards so if you want to compare in realtime use   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, 'in between pre accepts'|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|casenjo:  NS comes out shooting, bidding a game on a finesse, but alas the king is offside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: duboin should make this, he does not need to guess @ds when @cs split that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the club players I was talking about are in the other room  but we have a great room!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks, to leave West with an awkward comtinuation.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And Boye has his work cut out for him on hand  1|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hello, henry!|pg||

nt|frankaus: alfredo versace should not be troubled here |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: and let's send good thoughts to Antonio Sementa for speedy recovery|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c continuation wd create communications problems|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: but he has a trump control problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @H from Jeff or a spade? |pg||
nt|ritong: so, if aker plays a @h back, south might consider pitching a @c|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi everyone, welcome back|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's @S3 was a discouraging signal, warning West not to continue spades (into the lion's jaw - South's A-J).|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well done to reach the reasonably cold 3N: cold as the cards lie in anycase|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|nt|henryb:  of all the continuations that was probably the worst|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: re-morning Frank |pg||

nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome to our Canadien expert!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to the 4th quarter of the Spingold Round of 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome they already started board 17|pg||

mb|2D!|an|artificial, 18-19 BAL|nt|ahollan1: 18-20 BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  indeed |pg||
nt|ritong: he had some idea about @s Q location, since east did not cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Canadian, I am not french :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 7 passes in a row so far |pg||
mb|2S!|an|artificial, transfer to 2NT|nt|casenjo:  oops! So Sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
nt|mich-b: EW in the closed room bid to a not so elegant 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|casenjo:  I was originally from Detroit, so close to Windsor that I was semi-Canadian, and do understand the difference|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn has something to think about here. It sounds to him like a pinocle deck|pg||
nt|cicus: best here to play some number of @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to reach the cold 4@c after a 1N opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best i can do for EW  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=700&pid=223|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hey Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: I think West here can rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|iceking: both times Sementa had 4-5 in majors though:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Andy is just catching up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: We are up to Board 21 so I am just inputting the bidding and score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes - that's quite a replacement pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiya Andy|pg||
mb|3C!|an|5332 OR !H's OR 6+!D w/short!C|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
nt|cicus: tough though for West to give @D preference with 6 spades|pg||
nt|mich-b: giving preference to opener's 1st suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  2N forces 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  for majors |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think perfect defense gets 8 tricks   pointed kings, 2@C and 4 trump  but might be tough to untangle all of that|pg||
mb|3H!|an|I have hearts|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: vuls wrong to act|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and the expert is correct, Bjorn new the vulnerability was wrong here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  knew, not new|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides raising would have just helped opponents who actually have missed an excellent slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sorry, folks, had a couple drinks at dinner, please excuse my typing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For a change we have a straight forward auction, negative double, cue bid asking partner how good his overcall is....|pg||
nt|cicus: N comes to the rescue|pg||
nt|cicus: X?|pg||
nt|dinos1: lucky 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thats as far as my notes go :(|pg||
mb|4C!|an|agrees!H1st round contorl, no !S control|nt|cicus: they play extended takeout X's so I would not be surprised to see one|pg||
nt|iceking: would 2nt be more natural with Fredins hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  is Sementa really playing at the other table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Accident of position gets E-W off to the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish you hadn't just announced symptoms -- i know enough to be very worried about those|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them|pg||
nt|dinos1: will guess @hQ in 6@h after finding out @s6-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can move cursor over the highlighted bids to see explanation operator is getting at the table|pg||
mb|4D!|an|cue, with !S control|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
nt|frankaus: slam is on @H guess will find the !Q IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Are scores known? Seems empty even on Bridgewinners|pg||
mb|5C!|an|cue|nt|fabsayc: with nobody wanting to quit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Glad to have you back!!!|pg||
nt|mich-b: Versace knew they had a @D fit , so was not tempted to rebid @Ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||
nt|cicus: not this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe:  http://bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the reason i ask about Sementa -- in the 2nd round after 6 boards he became ill and was taken to the hospital|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great news if he's back in the saddle|pg||
mb|5S!|an|cue|nt|frankaus: @S look probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rare 3 or 7 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|fabsayc: thanks, you too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Martin Johnson and Jo Anne Casen are your commentators this evening|pg||
nt|cicus: this will make in comfort|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much harder to beat this if North plays it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: hi guys|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|frankaus: looking 4 the grand  that will be hard to get home|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: hi Jon|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss bought the hand in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Our jobs are to keep you entertained and not make complete fools out of ourselves :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all at the same time?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spade break makes this a bit complicated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fleisher - Kamil have been replaced by Chip Martel and Lew Stansby; one of the longest running partnerships in North America and inventors of the "Rule of 20"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 6@d, hmm, wasnt 5N showed @dA as well?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: but at this point, perhaps...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Will certainly guess @hs now. Needs a @s @d Squeeze to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria has put on his glasses to study the dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Brogeland and Saelensminde won the recent 3-day Lifemaster Pairs, here in New Orleans.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: would make the hand if the @d J was with North|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been living in New York, but according to Roland Wald, he will now be playing for Sweden again. Nice news for the Swedes. He is a marvelous player.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: re hi David |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The good news for Aker is that he won't go 4 down|pg||
nt|iceking: Fredins only change is low diamond now|pg||
nt|iceking: chance even|pg||
nt|ady: can get and end play to save a diamond trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  This is the sort of hand that makes one appreciate the difficulty of playing with less experienced partners|pg||
nt|dima:  He surely ruffed middle|pg||
nt|jlrice: I am surprised he was able to get back to the table so quickly  but apparently he is ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yeah, Jan told me that he seems to be ok. The hospital did a bunch of tests and thinks it was just a pinched nerve, but who knows.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: appreciate Henry?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fredin has found a winning line|pg||
nt|frankaus: greco can guard @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: conceeding a ruff  but making hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco shaking his head|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: he might|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct to win with @dA and return @dJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: due to @d block dcl may go for -1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: he must now continue clubs for safety|pg||
nt|harmon: there is no squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria didn't show any signs of disappointment, just casually playing as his normal self|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@d wd be OK with same hand but 2-5-2-4 shape|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|fifee: always wary of the 4333|pg||
nt|dburn: duplication in clubs, not enough shape all round|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chip: There have already been three slams today on one of two finesses. This one is on two of 2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, you don't need all that much more than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|chip: well, need to pick up the hearts or find a lucky D lie.|pg||
nt|dburn: since even if you then misguess hearts, you can hope to throw an opponent in on the third round to break diamonds|pg||
nt|fifee: too much duplication. need 2 things to go well|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, given the overcall this may now be a good slam|pg||
nt|chip: yes, and might help to guess the hearts too.|pg||
nt|peachy: NS card for those who might be interested http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|dburn: may be an aks for a spade control, but that may in turn lead to some thoughts of seven...|pg||
nt|fifee: N could easily have 6322 though|pg||
nt|fifee: 7@H in the Open Room!|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...after all, East would bid this way with 3-4-2-4 shape, and then seven would not be all that far wrong|pg||
nt|chip: asking for a spade control, so Moss will accept with 5S. Now from W point of view 7 could be good, but takes Ax AQxx Kx Kxxxx, maybe too much for 3H|pg||
nt|dburn: but this may be asking for top heart honours, in which case the brakes may be applied just before the cliff edge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad reached for the bidding card, then put it back, now|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|chip: doubt they will get to 7. Even if E bids 6C and W 6D, both should be out of further moves. (maybe mistook 5N as GSF?)|pg||
nt|chip: I'm told they bid 7 in the other room. That was a LOT of bidding (and won't make)|pg||
nt|chip: unless N leads a D.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fifee: this could be a big swing.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sementa asks about 5NT and Brad says not sure - "we've never had this exact auction before"|pg||
nt|chip: needs to guess the heart to make unless a D is led, then has a squeeze.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Sementa asks about 3@h and Brad says it could be lots of hands - shape with 14+ or balanced 2NT rebid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: now a question of whether Fred will guess hearts, or play for the combination shot in the red suits|pg||
nt|chip: The other room had a long complex auction after E opened 2D to show 18-19 balanced, then something must have gone seriously awry.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|fifee: I am betting fred will not hook. too much of a swing if @Hs are 22. anyone betting?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not sure why he did not play for seven, is doubtful he will get any useful info by playing the spades about whether to finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now ruff and discard assures martel gets a trump|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Very well done again!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but apparently defense went wrong|pg||
nt|cicus: well it seems declarer los  his way here|pg||
nt|cicus: can't see why he did not return a @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Sigurbj√∂rn|pg||
nt|henryb:  still, N-S did better than par which is -130 in 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice d -- and bad analysis from me|pg||
nt|harmon: bet its not nice bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco taps the screen to suggest to get on with the next board|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opening lead places those high cards with south, and north bid vulnerable. Kamil's problem is: did North bid on strength or length?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have given a suit-preference signal on the first round of hearts, attempting to show the @SK to her partner.|pg||
nt|henryb:  appreciate in the sense of gaining understanding, not in the sense of getting warm feelings|pg||
nt|po-s: This is a European fight in a way; Norway against Poland/Russia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sigurbj√∂rn and Magn√∫s formed a very successful partnership at the EC in Belgium recently and qualified for the Bermuda Bowl next year. Well done guys!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred must have a way to differentiate  good and bad @S hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the other match ended later than this match, so vugraph couldn't restart until all 4 tables back in play|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: if there ever was a horse beaten to death, it would probably be computer deals|pg||
nt|brolucius: I believe that only 3 or 4 of the top 20 seeds have an all-American squad.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The best bridge book I ever read is Mike Lawrence's "How to Read Your Opponents' Cards"|pg||
nt|iceking: 2sp will not work here |pg||
nt|iceking: thx Roland!|pg||
nt|ady: 20-29 this time|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yeah I think that's what they've written (Fred has 2 ways to bid 2@S)|pg||
nt|jlrice: Lauria/versace can make slam in clubs  but might wind up getting to diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Upon clarification between the N/E side of the screen Moss had written something down and Versace couldn't quite understand and after a few more small whispers and hand gestures ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria asked if 2@S was natural and Moss seems a bit agitated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gitelman-moss settle in 6@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|po-s: All enlightenment is appreciated, Hensry|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, helness didn't balance over 2@H but Gromov did over 3.|pg||
nt|mich-b: of course Versace will not overcall - he needs a much better suit for that|pg||
nt|iceking: in more normal methods bidding might go 1sp-1nt-2d-2h-4h|pg||
nt|poohbear: havent made that yet|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: 2@S now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 3@H :(    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: played from west and Sementa [obviously feeling better]  leads @SJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: did N show @s suit in OR?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: some how do not see a double coming at this table |pg||
nt|phil: hi all, I'll try to break some of the silence here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: You can hover your mouse over the alerts :D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch other rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|dinos1: so will see @s6-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches are playing the same boards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  or in the sense of gaining value|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like it'll be expensive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sit next to a mirror :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all of this bids are alreated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  or place one behind the table|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That is a pretty card for Fredin to see|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the eigth trick on this lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope   2@C=2-way checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: not an advert for bad suit weak two bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: play 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: With 6-4 in @S and @H it is better to rebid 2@H and not 2@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lol yes i have east west convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: A little lost thats all|pg||
nt|phil: 1@h shows spades; 2@s shows a minimum raise with 4 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: looked on the wrong side|pg||
nt|phil: 1@c - 1@d would show hearts if you are curious|pg||
nt|phil: 1@c - 1@s is usually diamonds, or some minor oriented hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=forced|pg||
nt|ady: spades play well  for n/s|pg||
nt|dinos1: as spades play well in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne decision partially affected by whether or not 1N rebid could have singleton @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@H is artificial showing both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but it is so human to blame a machine rather than your own skills|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why the final contract was doubled at the other table - sure, South opened the bidding, but even so...|pg||
nt|mich-b: as Fallenius did|pg||
nt|mich-b: Sometimes partner (who responded 1NT) has a @H fit and game can be reached|pg||
nt|mich-b: while he would be passing 2@S|pg||
nt|mich-b: with both major suit kings offside , this will go down|pg||
nt|cicus: seems that E will have to return @DK then at winning with @CK|pg||
nt|cicus: lest the small @D goes on @Cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! the only killing is @dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and whether Seamon can raise 1@S-2@S with only 3|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Hampson avoids @S lead -- this hand comes down to @CJ entry to finesse @S10|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|sybarra: are the results of round 3 posted?  so we know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 hearts with only 6 is tricky|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like this should be down 2|pg||
nt|dinos1: make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: *do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that actually happened to me in a regional in seattle, we were set up in the hall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- it would have been fun to watch |pg||
nt|dinos1: now only 1@s loser|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: don¬¥t understand @cJ|pg||
nt|cicus: on a @H S can win and finesse in @Cs|pg||
nt|mich-b: what is behind this @CJ play?|pg||
nt|cicus: not now of course|pg||
nt|cicus: unless we are in for an undo|pg||
nt|henryb:  now down 1|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, he can|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss rebid 2@S|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on Round of 32 to the left|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The lead opens to 20, when the diamond slam was bid in the other room on Board 34|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and after south raised spades :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They usually cover the mirrors in the hotel playing areas, I once played where they forgot to cover the mirrors on the ceilings.  They were on strange angles and everyone could see all of the hands.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i shift to spade 9|pg||
nt|mich-b: declarer could hope to get 1 discard on @C and 2 on the @Ds|pg||
nt|jlrice: this will be an 11 imp victory for diamond as they reached the right slam in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  best line looks to be to ruff a diamond and lead a small club to the 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Brogeland likes an 8-11 point weak-two opening. Weaker hands are shown with a multi 2@D.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it isn't really clear who could/should have bid differently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably only chance for slam is for Versace to deny @S stop|pg||
nt|jlrice: hampson just drove it to slam after his partners 1C opening in the other room|pg||
nt|dinos1: what wd be 4N over 4@s?|pg||
nt|dinos1: by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who knows?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   i forgot to notice that trump are 4-0!!   sorry about that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: maybe Maksymets was anxious that his partner should lead a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fredin perfect again!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin on fire, has even guessed diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|casenjo:  He knows if Martel gets he he will shift to a club honor|pg||
pc|s9|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|phil: if youve never seen this system before, think of the standard auction of 1@c - 1@s - 2@s|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same boards are being played in both matches so you can compare bidding/play using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Gitelman and Moss have left the table to discuss something quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: And not much word was exchanged between Lauria and Versace about the missed slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: it was sort of a safety play, but not 100%|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think there are only 6 tricks if E-W get a second trump in before declarer can ruff a club|pg||
pc|d6|mc|10|nt|ady: but why not support spades after the 2@C checkback?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all other rooms in 6@H on board 50|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|d|nt|fifee: these cards were well shuffled|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: The commentators were complaining about the boring boards the first half, so I guess the dealing machine decided to do better now|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|chip: normal but unlucky lead, now will make it.|pg||
nt|dburn: North could have tried 4@s, I guess - might make, might be a save, might induce the opponents to bid 5@h|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chip: might go for 1100 if partner has only 3 spades.|pg||

nt|henryb:  This is actually a fair game (needs a club guess or the heart finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: David, I think four teams are all-american, but there are 43 foreigh players left, and 50 Americans, given some random decisions on Lev, Pepsi,Shivdasani, Fallenius|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe Saelensminde could ask then? Maybe a bit different standard being nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: I do not have their current convention card. Sometimes they use 2@D as a weak major two-suiter (possibly 4-4) in the first two seats when NV against Vul. In that case the 2@S has a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: wider range than 8-11.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lev and Pepsi are both full time US residents; Fallenius was, but has resumed playing for Sweden|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jaggy, I think has been laying in the US trials and not for India|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Claiming 5 sorry |pg||
nt|henryb:  playing*|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul launched a comeback|pg||
nt|casenjo:  De Knijff gained 7 on another double partial swing on board 50|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: missed up the play there i must confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: my apologizes|pg||
nt|cicus: ugly hand at West, will he open?|pg||
nt|iceking: will Sementa open 1h in 3seat |pg||
nt|fifee: I am Patty Anderson from Podunk WV :)|pg||
nt|phil: hi Patty|pg||
nt|fifee: hi phil :)|pg||
nt|fifee: Needless to say, we have a "favorite son" at our table tonight :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco is shaking his head in disappointment about something|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: no|pg||
nt|ritong: we do, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: And they're quickly back|pg||
mb|1H|nt|poohbear: @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  e/w did well to stay out of 4@H at the other table.  this could be another swing for Strul.|pg||
nt|iceking: probably not his style|pg||
nt|ritong: go fred!|pg||
nt|fifee: hi henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15(+)-18(-)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 1@H=5+@S (from a reliable source, and I just saw Versace writing it down)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yeah, maybe thinking that he should have doubled 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  And also here strong result for EW in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spec also mentioned 5+@S -- i was trying to see if my notes mentioned specifics |pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: west too flat for anything beyond 3@C|pg||
nt|ritong: brad puts it medium high|pg||
nt|phil: now, a component of this structure is that a 1@d opener promises an unbalanced hand most of the time|pg||
nt|ritong: now EW are in bad shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may have stolen this one |pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W play a forcing 1@c?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hopefully the weak notrump can be a double partial swing for EW|pg||
nt|fifee: great defensive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|ritong: because they can t at the same time establish a fit and use an exclusion BW afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell him same thing happened in the other room|pg||
nt|dinos1: wd lead @d had S dbl 3@d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: A very borderline slam. I wonder if they will take a look at it.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  EW can make 2 spades and NS can make 3 clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: and I totally agree with that style I must say|pg||
nt|fifee: exactly henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: I think they are likely to reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|phil: if anyone has a cc for EW, please whisper it to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  wonder what their agreement is on XX?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Paul|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi Paul, welcome :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or at least bought it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do i detect a rooting interest?|pg||
nt|cicus: E took away the opponents' @H game in Open room|pg||
nt|fifee: here is the link to see the bracket list for the Spingold http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/spingold/|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Well, NS have been PERFECT...It would be nice to get the match closer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fair enough|pg||
nt|mich-b: 4@H is a good contract , and likely to make even on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: they might stagger to a grand, though  but i think none of them could affirm " it s cold" before seeing part s hand|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will play 3NT      not that straight forward on a club lead   |pg||
pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  In the other room, Strul competed with 4 clubs, over 3 diamonds and South went down in 4 their diamond contract giving 6 more imps to Strul|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally I do not think it is very close to the border|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, you have to take the finesse before you have a chance to set up a discard on the clubs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know exactly what 2nt shows here, but it's clearly conventional.  Some pairs use 2@S artificially here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW used to play  Precision or Polish Club depending upon vulnerability -- it is possible they're always Precision now|pg||
nt|iceking: well he can pass 1sp respond and 1nt respond so wouldnt be any crime|pg||
nt|phil: the defense in the OR didnt attack clubs early enough, so declarer was able to set up a heart and 10 tricks rolled in|pg||
nt|dinos1: def can take 3@s and 1 @c, what else?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play 2@C does not guarantee a 4-card major   note that applies only to 2N rebid  3N absolutely has 4@H in Seamon sequence|pg||
nt|ady: seems so  but could go wrong|pg||
nt|poohbear: Bad break in the HCPs for NS here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Duboin didn't get the chance -- over DBL  Gitelman jumped immediately to 4@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: only 7 tricks for NS|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: an easy rise to 4@h in my opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Linda Lee|pg||
nt|lml: hello :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dima:  I think Gromov-Dubinin use weak NT so it was straight invit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome Linda|pg||
nt|dinos1: same 3N in OR|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Possible XX shows a @s honor; possible it shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C5 lead is ATTITUDE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a coincidence that it is 4th|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  oh, thanks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|mich-b: in the OR Wast opened 1@D , and East responded 1@H ... after North declined the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|mich-b: he needs to win the @CA|pg||
nt|mich-b: cash some @D tricks , discarding his @Cs|pg||
nt|mich-b: and play a @S from dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: now declarer had better take this with the ace|pg||
nt|mich-b: or he can pitch 4@Ss on 4 @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: also problems with @S-losers|pg||
nt|pelu: @H7 can come in play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|phil: splendid - sometimes the barrage bidding helps you too|pg||
nt|phil: on 35|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss asked an explanation about the meaning of 4@C and Lauria said it was a cuebid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  It needs a spade break, a diamond finesse; about 18%|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Chip Martel was NPC for my Women's Team eons ago, but I am also very fond of Bjorn, so.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Either way it was a really good match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this defense is awkward for martel, as he does not know club king is a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play standard count/attitude and Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|casenjo:  Not a good slam|pg||
nt|po-s: And you will be disappointed when in spite of a successful dia finesse you go  down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: North South seem to be in an excellent contract which has the advantage of making|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Yes, you need two good things to go right. |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|po-s: heart from dummy?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: east is known to hold four minor cards|pg||
nt|cicus: to discard all the spades woud cut def communications even if it would be ruffed with a small trump|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria turned over his first trick card too quickly and Moss said it was too fast. Moss doesn't seem very patient currently from what I can see|pg||
nt|jlrice: moss needs to switch to a club immediately in order to give his partner the necessary club ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just quick catchup from our operator|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those thinking West is too good for 1N  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says it is worth 15.05|pg||
nt|po-s: what about discarding two clubs, then a spade|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    really downgrades Queens - especially the unprotected @HQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: Platnick overtook the heart because he didnt want Diamond to give anything away with a switch.  a thoughtful partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  Seamon "knows" the @cK is offside from the opening bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ady: not sure he could afford that safety play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting line  --  best play for 3@D  and hope to get count to play for 4@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder why not duck @s10 after @dK?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  not to mention no club ruff on opening lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: help|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: problem comes when platnick has 5@C and TWO @S winners|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Discretion is the better part of valor on this hand, North got off to a nice lead, however South has blocked the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either that or mass deja vu|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  I think he can make it now.  @D J overtaken with the Q to set up the suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  or this way if they cover, even easier|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|po-s: If I were playing the DK would be offside, they would duck the club and spades would be 4-1. In four spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s would make more tricks than 3N, but 3N is certainly safe|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfe: Director has been called|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 35  Berkowitz-Sontag got to the slam  also after 3@S interference   the 4th table still on board 34|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: (by Moss)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss is claiming that Lauria said it was a cue-bid looking at the @CAK in his hand|pg||
nt|jlrice: he still might have played it that way thinking his partner was short in clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: So rather than catering for a partner's club ruff, he tried for a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss is very frustrated|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Seems like war lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|casenjo:  the other room is playing 2 clubs DOUBLED....if the defense goes as well that will be 500 and a small gain|pg||

nt|ahollan1: where's Michael Rosenberg when you really need analysis of best line?|pg||

nt|po-s: wonder where the two extratricks came from|pg||
mb|1H!|an|3+!H + another longer suit|nt|brolucius: The VG operator is always Top of the Pops with the BBO kibitzers. We all know how difficult it is! |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The vugraph operator's job is tough. And I believe today they are behind screens which makes it often difficult to see everything that is going on  at the table.|pg||
nt|dima:  Another strong result from Helness-Helgemo in the other room - you have to get to 4@s first|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not great but may well be bid, a lot of points|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Asya|pg||
nt|mich-b: interesting choice by Lauria ... "Majors" with 5-4|pg||
nt|cicus: unusual 2@C|pg||
nt|mich-b: many players promiss 5-5 with that call|pg||
nt|pelu: but 5-4 is also on many players card|pg||
nt|cicus: E thought his hand warranted a bid and find this best|pg||
nt|mich-b: I am told that 2@C shows 5-4 specifically for them , 2@D would show 5-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I dont mean to brag but i did play in a cayne match and won |pg||
nt|cicus: oh, how easy|pg||
nt|mich-b: thx to specs who pointed this out|pg||

mb|p!|an|0-5|nt|brolucius: South 1@D, West 1@H.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this 1nt is a game force|pg||
nt|cicus: was it here on BBO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|bessi2: n-s on their way to an easy 3N as the cards lie|pg||
nt|iceking: dull 3nt coming up|pg||
nt|phil: Moss is a card carrying member of the 14 point NT (playing 15-17) club....but even he thinks this is a crummy hand|pg||
nt|lml: saves a few imps|pg||
nt|dinos1: u still have chances for @d fin and break in any red suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: I have never tried it but I suspect that my limit would be about two deals and six tricks. Then I would get a headache and pass it over to someone else.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have yet to figure out how they bid with a normal 1nt response|pg||
nt|iceking: S might dbl this|pg||
nt|paulg:  good but not great would be a better description|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have copy of Struhl-Becker CC from 2009 trials -- not sure if it is still online|pg||
nt|dima:  They work a lot on their system ... some changes compared to the last european championship|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a normal 3N bid now.. knows east will lead short d if pd declares 4h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry had to look at what they put |pg||
nt|iceking: might go for penalty|pg||
nt|bessi2: dbl here is surely t/o  or ?|pg||
nt|iceking: he knows east has 0-1 d |pg||
nt|iceking: but i agree i would not dbl with so weak spots just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|bessi2: will be difficult to distinguish 4c Major and 5card Major if cant to dbl here|pg||
nt|lml: but best if they bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Interesting Becker did not have more constructive raise available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dima - when did they stop flip-flopping between Precision and Polish?|pg||
mb|d|nt|dima:  Dont know exactly but they do switch a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D probably a random game try with @D length just a coincidence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: support double by fredin|pg||
nt|phil: dbl means = "do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|ritong: brad now and then tries a tactical opening, but doing so at unfav first seat would be delirious|pg||
nt|phil: call it tactical, but he loves to upgrade - moreso than Fred|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21   3N=NF, 4@S & 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Limit raise in spades, Bergen|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: This is the bidding folks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dima:  Now North has a huge hand within double fit|pg||
nt|dima:  So it comes to 500 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch the other room in realtime using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead auction if passed out|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I tend to lead trump at low level contracts|pg||
nt|casenjo:  unless there is a glaring better lead|pg||
nt|cicus: well, congrats, not easy to defeat them in 28 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Im sorry about the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Alex will surely swing the axe now whether 5@d or 5@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And at this level of play, they lead the expected|pg||
nt|cicus: the meaning of the XX?|pg||
nt|cicus: smoke screen?|pg||
nt|pelu: exp: bid the 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure what the dbl redbl means|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any good plan to play this?|pg||
nt|cicus: best suggestion by a spec: probably i have a preference that doesn't want the lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: this doesnt look likely to mkae|pg||
nt|pelu: I am still only up to 7 tricks :(|pg||
nt|mich-b: Lauria will soon have his @H suit established , and has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|po-s: now 3NT and Sementa might double...|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i doubt he can dbl this Pio he has no idea how many hcp NS have |pg||
nt|bessi2: that would be aggressive, pd obstructing green vs red|pg||
nt|phil: the main choices are pass and 4@h - pard won't always have 5@h for the x|pg||
nt|paulg:  we've missed a 1@s opener here, then Cayne has shown a singleton club and a raise to 4@s and Platnik has saved|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok, we're back to real time now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: sort of love hate lead,   hope that was not a single @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond's 1N=14-16|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: good duck by kamil also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: leaving partner with another trump (hopefully)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Levin-Weinstein only beat 2 clubs by ONE trick, so a pickup by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|po-s: Sementa might - ok, no|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think this is the right auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bessi2: fallenius can't really afford to duck this... could be his 9th trick and diamonds rarely 5-2 anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: declerar cant go wrong here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|dinos1: trump lead is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = max @H    presumably 4@D would be max @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Seems like I accidently redealt rather than claimed on board 36. After this board is finished I will quickly score 36|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: since Dubinin DBLs it doesn't apply, but good point for partnerships to discuss if PASS would be forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all south bids are relays, no idea what fredin has shown so far|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4th @c will beat it -2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: probably a club to king and another diamond lead now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did i mention the 5 minute think?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rip Van Winkle Coup|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sit there long enuf that the opponents go to sleep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7NT actually looks slightly better than 7@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could survive with club jack third even if diamonds dont run|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: showing 19+ a 5-4-3-1 hand and 2 key cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what about the critical diamond queen|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe declarer can play spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can it be made if Fallenius wins on hand and plays on @s? @h are blocked!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: many play that forcing PASS applies only if he'd bid something stronger than 4@S on last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use standard count & attitude|pg||
pc|c7|nt|phil: but with no spade duplication, game in hearts is normal, frankly 4@s x'd looks par|pg||
nt|ritong: a good par, two off|pg||
nt|fifee: we saw 1 14 pt NT opener that truly went awry in the Strul Lynch match yesterday.  You can see it at http://tinyurl.com/2d9gxt5|pg||
nt|phil: what board Patty? |pg||
nt|fifee: click on board 32.  7D at the bottom and then click next to see the auction|pg||
nt|fifee: actually was 15 point NT at one table|pg||
nt|fifee: excuse me 13 pt :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no @S.....I am sure Aker is pondering entire hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He must keep @SQ in dummy, then he should be OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I meant worrisome lead from declarers point of view originally,  not now |pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure what his worries are|pg||
nt|ritong: what can happen if he plays a @h now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That North wins and continues clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: keep to 2 more losers and make 4   |pg||
nt|ritong: well, @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: @d Q overtake|pg||
nt|ritong: after cashing @h Q|pg||
nt|brolucius: I like to spend around 10 seconds of every minute (at least) half-asleep. This is not a prime requirement for being a VG operator.|pg||
nt|phil: wow 7@d x'd - bizarre in this event|pg||
nt|ritong: isporski plays for@hK9 with his part|pg||
nt|ritong: not impossible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- they do follow the trend of changing range in 3rd vul and 4th|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|casenjo:  Weinstein and Levin limped into 6 diamonds after a misunderstood keycard auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kickback misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South showed a powerhouse and then bid 4NT, signed off in 6 diamonds, thinking he was off a keycard.|pg||
nt|phil: would require a minor trick too|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|casenjo:  North never showed his huge hand and just bid 6.|pg||
nt|poohbear: well defense doesnt know that declarer only has a dbltn @s so a 4th @c not likely|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  good contract, although unsuccessful|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: that might fail against a desperately unlucky 2-2 trump break - this is not straightforward|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That does not happen at this level of play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect to be wrong after that much thinking|pg||
nt|iceking: correct line |pg||
nt|dinos1: nothing to discard on ruff/sluff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hampson may suspect @S distribution by greco failure to compete -- but that is only a [very] slim inference|pg||
pc|dK|nt|po-s: now there are|pg||
nt|pelu: unexp mistake by Lauria|pg||
nt|mich-b: now declarer is surely making|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: well it is only a 50-50 grand slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but a missed opportunity|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s trying to tangle him up |pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he saw south discarding on the first round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when 1N=14(+)-17|pg||
nt|dinos1: low @s now?)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|casenjo:  Now west is thinking, :what was south thinking"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  East had overcalled 2 spades, so the auction: 1D - 1S - 2S by south. When Levin bid 4NT I think he assumed that diamonds were trump and Weinstein showed only one keycard, not thinking that the king of diamonds was a keycard|pg||
nt|dinos1: K|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mich-b: I wander why both Easts decided that their pd is not likely to have the @HJ|pg||
nt|ady: loks like 50 to  n/s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: soloway use to sleep, others to knit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fleisher does not want to lead a spade because then diamond queen will cash|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and he doesn't want to lead a heart either, he really wants to pass the lead to someone else|pg||
nt|cicus: that XX may have confused Lauria|pg||
nt|bessi2: to bad us commentators can't claim the contracts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|warrens:  good @c shift by W, ensuring -2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: perhaps the initial duck in spades was so smooth he does not know the layout|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: so he did - sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF greco-hampson carding honestly  they use  udca|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca = upside-down count and attitude|pg||
pc|dA|nt|casenjo:  Things are still unlucky on these hand, are we the unlucky group or is there a pattern? :):)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ritong: i have my joker now, i might escape your whip next time i blunder:)|pg||

nt|mich-b: maybe he hoped for Jxx|pg||
nt|mich-b: and a misguess by declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: well, Jxx might do as well, but then small @H lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: On board 5 in the open room please ignore the 2cl bid in the end lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Haha. Yesterday when Seamon-Cayne was declaring a 3@C contract on @CAJxx opp x, people were telling me that it must be wrong. But -600 was the net result of 6 off vulnerable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: i play all keycard if we have bid even one suit|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Many 2/1 players abuse clubs when they want to force to game, but would liketo hear more rather than jumpto 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i must admit i prefer the 3NT bid in open room, though here is a matter of luck that it will gain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this time the weak no trump has worked|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT forced rebid in the system . Distasteful as it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: nice stop by NS |pg||
nt|pelu: nice stop in both rooms - 20-21/ +4|pg||
nt|mich-b: many pairs would be in 3NT here|pg||
nt|bessi2: dont they play transfer responses to 1club ?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ulf Nilsson has been encouraging me (and others) to overcall on these hands ... of course he can play the cards better than many|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry not 6+@H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  Who wants to watch the other table when Boye and Eric are here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no 1D-2S-3S-P-4H-P-4NT; Levin made 2 bids, spade cuebid and 4NT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Someone lied to you again|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that both rooms would be in 3Nt is vuln :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I have passed a 2NT opening with such a hand...|pg||
nt|iceking: if they do 1nt sure looks strange respond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: basically  2N=catchall|pg||
pc|c6|nt|po-s: I thought they did|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting to see what Hampson does, he is one of the more aggressive US players|pg||
nt|dinos1: well, S can saet @s trick now|pg||
nt|ady: 9th trick appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about the 2@D bid    typically  opener would show @H with any hand that had game interest|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 2@h wd show min?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse drury   2@S would have said  [i've got junk|pg||
nt|dinos1: with hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   min with @S & @H would just bid 2@S with known 8+ fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anything other than 2@S shows at least game interest|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bessi2: well.. doesn't look that way after 1N right you are|pg||
nt|dinos1: .|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Gazzilli; an immediate 2@D would be limited to 14|pg||
nt|sybarra: make coffee, pour a glass of wine or whatever |pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c natural or some good hand; 2@d a kind of waiting bid; 3@d some good hand|pg||
nt|ritong: i really love this convention, and i m sure it is the one which will spread the most soon|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer who is an expert at evaluating BBO commentators tells me, reassuringly, that only 1 crazy comment out of every 6 puts me well into the top 10%.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, Bal-Zmud are worth watching too, Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  That assumes, David, that your estimate of 83% sensible comments is accurate|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Our operator is trying to get a runner to get him scores from the other room, we did this at the at the Team Trials a few years back|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: NS   standard count, reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dima:  Russian team has missed the qualification spot for the Bermuda Bowl by less then penalties during the last European championship|pg||
nt|phil: another mundane hand. Will probably make 5|pg||
nt|phil: although I think 6 is there is he plays wide open and guesses clubs|pg||
nt|phil: *if|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: this table is 3 boards ahead of everyone else so it will be difficult to make helpful comparisons :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The tournament director has not returned, so they will study the facts on board 36 and later return with their ruling.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so sure with regard to the other side of the pond|pg||
nt|dburn: best have a lot of tens before you use it - every one of them here is working hard|pg||
nt|ritong: but it does not fit well with forcing Nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT forcing is ok if you play it unlimited but fleisher judged hand too strong for that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No they don't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|fifee: ruff a couple of @Hs and low toward the @CK makes 6 |pg||
nt|phil: well that requires him to leave a trump out|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like declarer must go down 1 as long as Diamond keeps his hands off the @sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another attitude lead that happens to be 4th best|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: @S lead against 3N north|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|warrens:  I know that on board 3 they played in 4@S, so 6 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fourth diamond will promote a trump|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|phil: on his way|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It does; the Italians play a forcing 1NT response|pg||
nt|fifee: for a short time :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: after all, not clear to move in Standard after 1@h-1@s-2@d-2@h|pg||
nt|cicus: but, as I am made aware, 4@H is not at all a bad contract - only goes down on a spade lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: is far from clear and not actually necessary at this point|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for R32 results and pairings in the R16|pg||
nt|iceking: so 1nt was just natural denies major |pg||
pc|hT|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i'm reminded my mistype was correct   2N DID deny 6+@C :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably fits well (as 2/1 player)  but need to think about implications |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe if we threaten them with Gazzilli, they'll let us have Multi, an American spectator suggests|pg||
nt|ritong: italians play a relatively complicated version, with 2@c two wayed, either nat with @cs or a good hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont get me started Roland |pg||
nt|phil: home now - have to bid these slams guys :)|pg||
nt|lml: but 3@D or 2@S is probably a make|pg||
nt|lml: so not terrible|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm told Hampson passed ... more than once|pg||
nt|henryb:  Platnick is now endplayed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: now it is clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: board 4 3NT should have gone down as the play went in OR   defence let it through|pg||
pc|dT|nt|casenjo:  now they score they trump separately|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: well, maybe 4@H is better than 2NT|pg||
nt|mich-b: Fredin trying to choose between a simple @C finesse|pg||
nt|mich-b: and some obscure endplay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another @h will tell him...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfe: Didn't mean to click that fast|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dJ|nt|mich-b: I think he will settle for the finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: i have " personal" ideas about that and open 2M with M and @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gazzilli is in operation after 1@H 1@S; 1@H 1NT and 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only if E discards another @c - I think|pg||
nt|mich-b: EW have kept enough winners|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: looks like it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: at these levels (spingold etc) all is ok, but what I would like to see is more open ideas by acbl at club/district level|pg||
nt|mich-b: so they cant be endplayed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: A is only good if E has bared his @CK|pg||
nt|pelu: and why sh Lauria do that?|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, maybe if E has Kxx of clubs and singleton @S honour now, then also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps the @sJ in trick2 was wrong|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|bessi2: italians started this 1club transfer trend and now none of the 3 pairs on the current national team play it :)|pg||

mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfb: bathroom break|pg||
nt|dburn: which is what has happened - normally it doesn't matter much, but with the match as it is, who knows what might matter?|pg||
nt|dburn: Diamond picked up a couple of IMPs for bidding 1NT without a stopper - at the other table they played 2@s without a fit or a stopper, and that went down two|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we're back|pg||
pg||

nt|henryb:  Look, I might also, but I think Brogeland and Saelensminde are a treat in their own way|pg||
nt|po-s: David, in order to avoid being accused of embarrassing you I¬¥ll switch table|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no doubt about removing 3@C doubled, partly because South had not spoken - at favourable vulnerability - on the first round.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Okay im getting a runner to give me results on the other team|pg||
nt|cicus: what happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting - why?|pg||
nt|mich-b: I thought that was Fredin's "plan"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North was upset with Easts thinking with his small clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: In the end|pg||
nt|mich-b: either the @CK will drop , or he will call the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Exactly|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see no problem with the pause by Lauria - he has to decide: @c or @s discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can the director make the king drop?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I agree with Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: On the 7 trick east was thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ehhh  Lund (not Fredin)|pg||
nt|mich-b: Roland , you agree with which Peter?|pg||
nt|mich-b: Ahhh ..ok :)|pg||
nt|ady: another quiet part score hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, Alfredo has ducked @s10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 30  Meltzer leads by 1   [this set 20-0]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this another 2@D opener or too strong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: rebid*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As David pointed out, the auction might die in 2@H wihout this gadget, as happened at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15(+)-18(-)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: match is rapidly getting out of hand|pg||
nt|fifee: this hand is not mundane |pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Some action again here|pg||
nt|dima:  If Gromov passes he will have a chance to double 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gromov choices are P, 4@S, RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness started with PASS but let them off the hook later in the auction|pg||
nt|dima:  East hand looks like a lot of defence and he faces 2nd seat VUL preempt|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North can make a slam here, south gets a heart lead through and goes down|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But, will they get that high?|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed i wonder why that is|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c is a good contract, needing 3-2 clubs and one of the kings onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: re what's happening with  35   for what it's worth -- i would always ask 2nd question  about  "what does cue of opener's first bid suit mean"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria pulled out 3@C and thought for a second to change to 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  P.O. Stay! there is no other table to watch|pg||
nt|dima:  So we are for business here|pg||
nt|po-s: "started" is not quite accurate|pg||
nt|henryb:  6N is not quite as good: needs the @cK on|pg||
nt|paulg:  always nice to see vulnerable opponents when you open a strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 7@d was also bid by Platnick and Diamond, although looking at the auction, there may have been guess work involved, but I cant tell for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Al means  36|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then i would correct with   i mean board 36|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Or will they play in diamonds or NT from the north?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2sp 5+ @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: alert probably because  "could have 4@H/@S"|pg||
nt|ady: the hand belongs to e/w in the majors   but they are not in the aution yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1N is down some tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I can find a document with 28 pages of Gazzilli system notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: "accepting the transfer with a good hand |pg||
nt|henryb:  @h + longer minor?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman's 1N is weaker so Moss PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh what a difference a +/- makes|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2nd best so S knows pd has 108xx(x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for hairsplitters  KnR says west hand only worth 19.35   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/bulletins/2010/02/6/  pages 8&9 for team rosters|pg||
nt|brolucius: South buys a great dummy, just as his partner did on the previous deal.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6D from north is best, again not great but clearly an opportunity for the trailing team|pg||
nt|iceking: this will not make but nothing they could do normal bidding|pg||
nt|fifee: 5 is not cold here|pg||
nt|phil: optimum spot and 11 tricks are a lock|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT probably minimum without a 4-card major, or perhaps any 4333|pg||
nt|dinos1: Cayne didnt want to bid 1N with low @h doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea that began with Walsh -- when responder bids 1@D = either no major or strong enough to bid over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10 shows @CJ  [Rusinow]|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dima:  A good point to discuss with your reg partner, most play XX = pls stay out of my way|pg||
nt|phil: ruff hearts, draw trump and play @sAK and a low one|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: that locks ten|pg||
nt|fifee: certainly fred will overtake to lead the @C|pg||
nt|phil: oh. |pg||
nt|phil: blind spot :)|pg||
nt|fifee: even if brad leads the club. still a @C loser|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
nt|fifee: those old 4333 hands will get you in trouble|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dima:  Xmas arrives and 2@s trick go through to boot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 philosophies   1 says if pure defensive hands  PASS then DBL  so that RDBL then DBL is more cooperative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other says RDBL first to enlist partner  but RDBL/DBL says PEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it helps to be on same page as partner :)|pg||
nt|cicus: thin game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but CC really does say 2@D=18-20  and 2N=20-21|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dima:  The heat is on - now they might get to @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul wishes to find a bid to say YOU choose :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Strul wants to RE-RDBL  to say  no-no  YOU choose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our comments crossed in the ether Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  happens from time to time :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either  a) assume more likely 5@D than 5@H  OR  b) bid 4@H because it is game|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think you care too much about GAME here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for scores|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and this one i think levin-weinstein may try|pg||
nt|cicus: of course I understand that Versace upgraded his hand|pg||
nt|cicus: his @Hs could have been 65432|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: they figure to still be behind a lot, which makes even 40% slams right to bid|pg||
nt|mich-b: regarding the director call on previous board - there is nothing wrong with that , of course|pg||
nt|bessi2: i adhere to your knowledge po-s, at leas first time I remember seeing this conventions was by the italians|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s10 made S hand as max)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: well, for our specs interested, google is your friend|pg||

nt|ritong: roland is your friend as well|pg||
nt|dburn: just how strong was 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-17|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting: Neither Lauria nor Seamon overcalled  with the heart hand on previous board|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  24 imps have been gained by NS when EW misread slam hands; Board 34 6 diamonds was made in the other room and on 38 they stopped in game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense signal problem here|pg||
nt|phil: is there a legitimate chance besides @sQj in the slot? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: That's where the + and - come in with people writing 14+-17 as an example|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dima:  This rather about the first digit in front of 00|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right - i was just trying to come up with any rationale for Strul making a choice|pg||
nt|dima:  And Alexander Dubinin comes to help with @d - lovely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would North bid the same way with 4@H 5@D?|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul is going to have some more grey hair till this board is over|pg||
nt|dima:  I think one MIGHT bid 4@d with 5@d and 4@h as some kibs point out|pg||
nt|ritong: ho hum|pg||
nt|ady: this will be expensive for n/s|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s4@h1@d for def|pg||
nt|dinos1: bad luck - N has A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm being inundated by specs complimenting Versace play in @H suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: I think it is unclear since there is always a [slim] chance that partner won't be able to bid EITHER red suit|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well now one still has to play the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South could easily be  3226|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: yes phil, but is somewhat exotic:)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N might have more 'practical' chances|pg||
nt|fifee: yes, who needs a @H stopper?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Not me|pg||
nt|fifee: hi Asya :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: :D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dima:  With that it might be more prudent to run from 4@c XX to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|dima:  And they will get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with natural trump trick isn't it?|pg||
nt|dima:  So let's see - 2@s + 1@c + 2@h + 1@d that is 800 to begin with|pg||
nt|dburn: that may be all - not so bad|pg||
nt|dima:  could be worse from Strul's perspective :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but hearts would have been better - perhaps not really possible to get to those, since Strul wasn't allowed to reredouble 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we ponder I'd like to retract an earlier statement of mine   Gromov-Dubinin have always played Precision throughout   i was thinking of a different pair [martens-jassem] who ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Precision or Polish depending upon vul|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NS play udca so in principle fallenius diamond was encouraging|pg||
nt|mich-b: if one thinks opp's tempo has mislead him|pg||
nt|pelu: need to play @c now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he's still going down at least 2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: @SJ in East makes South hand max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good split in both red suits :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but speaking of 35   Multon-Quantin only got to 5@C|pg||
nt|dinos1: Versace convinced Greco he has good @h)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: which wasn't long ago mind you, probably been around before that without me knowin|pg||
nt|iceking: 2H from Fallenius was not normal weak 2 bid it shows sound hand 10-13hcp |pg||
nt|iceking: Transfers after one club started i think in USA |pg||
nt|fifee: next :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the other legitimate chance is to find one with 7222 and @c KJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: and South drove to game with a nondescript seven count? boy, these guys are tough|pg||
nt|iceking: Al Roth probably didnt he invent all conventions anyway:)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however fredin knows any diamond tricks are not disappearing so he goes passive|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: EW  [and NS] play Smith Echo vs NT -- but Platnick primary signal in @D would be count|pg||
nt|ady: assuming they will eventually get their spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond needed mirrors to beat the hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dima:  Gromov-Dubinin play variable NT - 12+-15 in 1/2 and 15-17 in 3/4th|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Nothing wrong with that at all. That's why we have directors|pg||

nt|cicus: a play even I could find on a good day|pg||
nt|dinos1: strange|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: welcome Peter|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nickell is now down 53 and running out of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are other words besides 'strange' that might apply|pg||
nt|ady: worried south had 9XX spades?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Things are not boding well for Fleisher. He does not rate to make this hand, while his teammates are about to go down in 3 hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: no need in smith for @s coz E has encouraged it at tr.1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: closest other match has come to a push is  5 imps on board 51|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|dburn: maybe he does, unless of course that @c4 could be low from two|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: [thanks Gene]|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: I am not sure it matters much - or at least, it matters to the extent that he ought not to duck a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: but of course he didn't do that|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to play a trump now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that might be a bit double-dummy  but would have made for a good article|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - he was down threee more or less whatever he did|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|chip: looks like down 2 or so after setting up the hearts. |pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - rare case of the final contract being rather better from the weak hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but even though the Italians may open 2@d with the strong balanced hand, they will probably end up playing from that hand also|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|dburn: Fred pitching a club because he needs South to have @sK and @cA, so he is planning to play three rounds of spades in the hope that the suit divides and South then has to give him ...|pg||

nt|dinos1: encouraging wasnt enuff? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@h-1@s, and S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The tournament director has returned and says the result stands for board 36|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope now 1 imp on 54   but    34 imps in 5 hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace to Greco: "Why didn't you play spade"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: in case you weren't with us -- you missed an incredible 2nd set in the final of the women's ko [Wagar] where Dinkin made a successful defense of the title by an entire TWO imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Dorothy Truscott |pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a good effort all round - declarer kept his head, and the defenders needed to be and were accurate at the finish|pg||
nt|pelu: same result in OR - @h-lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was Greco who passed in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|casenjo:  They have gained 33 imps in 7 hands..that is a LOT|pg||

nt|fifee: heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny years ago |pg||
nt|casenjo:  When things like this happen to me, I find it is a good idea to get upn and get a glass of water|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S interesting bid, it would be a splinter or stopper ask for most partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open Big @C|pg||
nt|ady: might make this on a heart lead    5@C  safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not sure if there will be any more info about the table - everyone seems very dead serious lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond's actions will all deny 3+@S    [3=RDBL  4=raise]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: apparently fallenius plays it as stopper showing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H implies spade fit, and lead directing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a two edged sword though, as might help defense if you end in spade contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: spades? anyone got any spades?|pg||
nt|iceking: will get there i bet|pg||
nt|phil: ok I have to tend to things - enjoy everyone|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h lead - 9th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great dummy from Cayne|pg||
nt|dinos1: better if he had @dA :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman opened 2@S and that ended the auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf  for a longer version of Gazzilli, 18 pages. Worth reading if you have nothing better to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very productive 24-count, partly because both hands are 4-3-3-3.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the way the broadcast is set up, Asya can't enter results from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no suits break|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT 18-19.|pg||
nt|dima:  Who needs spades :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|bessi2: i'm pretty sure they will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other two matches after 16: Jacobs +41 and Dawson +16|pg||
nt|iceking: 3clubs probably shows sound hand now 3h and off they go|pg||
nt|bessi2: still wonder why he bypassed the spades, but I am not privy to their bidding understandings|pg||
nt|dinos1: now NS may be in 5@c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- the unbeatable 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: stopped n/s going down if west leads spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@c is cold with @d fin|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if you want to score plus 420 instead of plus 110, you need spades - and you need to bid them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil is either also bidding tactically or not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in modern bridge we alert all natural bids (sarcastically)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal    they open weak NT with 44441@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seamon deciding that 2NT is unlikely to make unless the diamonds come in, so worth looking for 5-3 spade fit and just concede more 50s in 3NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: not easy to lead @s vs 3N - S might have @sAQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder why pass 4@d and not bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zaleski Meltzer match has  1-0 for this set  versus our 3-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They reasoned that there were multiple chances to defeat the contract, with one of them being partner rising with the @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer 18-0 this set  to lead Zaleski by 19|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: now iam lost does this promice spade quebid|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - of course - Lauria had the spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: i second that|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was Dorothy Hayden then,  thx Joost |pg||
nt|ritong: a friendly dummy to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it possible for Brogeland to show restraint ever? No!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will get results from someone sooner or later|pg||
nt|po-s: I was  a bit surprised - Lauria would have|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s by N?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: This is a contract even I can make, also at 4:55 am. 6 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said joost,  meant Jack Oest    |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm surprised at Kamil, it is pretty normal to have support for spades on this auction, since west is  a passed hand, he didn;t open 2 hearts....|pg||
nt|pelu: so it looks like a lot of european players in the round of 8|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb by W?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not nearly as exciting as the last 2 sets of the Wagar [Ladies KO] Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S giving Seamon choice between 4N and 5@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: maybe he figured anything undoubled was ok|pg||
nt|fifee: good safe spot|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|fifee: do fred and brad play 1 way or 2 way drury |pg||
nt|ritong: i dunno|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: We will see if Erik can make bricks out of straw.|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably did not like the idea of having to find a bid after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d - ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was 6+@C, 9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|bessi2: some special cuebidding agreement i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3sp 4d probably shortness for them 3nt denies shortness looks like |pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, 4@s BY N is vg bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with help in @S   Cayne could bid 4N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didnt mean to click alreat|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: yes,  seems very logical after he raised to 3c|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl can ruff TWO @d's for +1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: No hurry to test the hearts, clearly. Instead declarer tries to make something of the diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take a while|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh what is this |pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt turbo or something |pg||
nt|iceking: aha Fredin responding with clubs as trumps i really dont believe that |pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to give partner @D ruff looks best|pg||
nt|dinos1: stiff @sA is known|pg||
nt|ady: not likely singleton diamond to pass 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Diamond passed 4@D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: oh, indeed he didn't, and I have a lot of sympathy with the choice of 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West open 1@D - and S  X and bid 3NT over 1@h - @s-lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting that neither pair could find the @S fit|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @d will tap dcl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: In the previous set, Moss (Gitelman's partner) opened 2@H on @SQx @HJ87xxx @DQx @CJ10x. I guess they have a structure to ask how bad the weak 2's can get!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this ones for Barry -- we definitely will NOT have another push|pg||
nt|dinos1: great @h8|pg||
nt|poohbear: @d  tapping the closed hand seems like the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the opening @DQ was Rusinow showing either the @DK or shortness  - but that's not how leads are marked on their CC|pg||
nt|dinos1: and final pitch of @sQ on @d ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco still in deep tank|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: One trick back, but not enough I think|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well, you were right, he made 1 brick|pg||
nt|po-s: OK in clubs too|pg||
nt|bessi2: maybe 4N turbo even number of aces and 5d asking for trump Q|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 4nt was 6keycard asking |pg||
nt|iceking: not sure how that works no idea what they are playing here|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt any swedes play Turbo|pg||
nt|bessi2: they got to the top spot, and although I dont understand the bidding, I am sure they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|bessi2: I sure miss playing turbo.. bridge is too easy when you can just ask for aces|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what i find it a bit pushy|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h cdnt work coz W must have @hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace now asks what type of carding do they normally give on the 1st trick (attitude/count)?  Greco answers usually attitude, but sometimes depends on the situation|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: I remember how annoyed I used to get, every time a team-mate said 'Going to 3NT didn't matter. We couldn't make 2NT.'  Ah, yes, very wise. For most people that would be an ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: excellent reason not to bid 3NT. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: I haven't noticed any extra bricks appearing yet.|pg||
nt|bessi2: or keycards to be more precise|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well judged auction from Cayne-Seamon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with the break i don't think any other table will catch up |pg||
nt|ady: yes  and no   they could have played 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N wd be =, with @h lead)|pg||
nt|dinos1: cdnt 4@d be bid as just lead-directing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: There has been a small problem in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sementa is feeling unwell and a doctor has been asked for|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: As a result, the play has been put on hold until further notice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel just posted  "Sementa just said to me that his wife might be watching and I should tell her that he's feeling better and not to worry"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but she also said play will stop and he's being taken to hospital -- let's keep good thoughts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: A tournament director has come to our table and is picking up the boards from this set. Because a break has been taken and every board is duplicated in other matches of BBO, the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rest of the boards are likely to be dead and change to a new set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The tournament director has now informed the players that Lauria-Versace will most likely be filling in for Duboin-Sementa in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Jan: "EMT asks whether Sementa flew today? We all said not today - he's a heavy smoker. They're getting him on the stretcher to take to the hospital."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Jan: "Alfredo says: "In case you die, you played very well today" - lots of laughter except from the EMT who says "don't talk about dying" "|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok, both teams have now come to an agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria-Versace will now fill in in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Both teams have compared the scores of the first 6 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They will now complete a new set of 10 boards in which we hope that there is a file for these boards to be broadcasted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: This room will now be closed - see you guys soon hopefully |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Not that I am criticising South, here, for bidding 3NT. That was the normal action opposite 18-19, of course.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 6-7 IMPs to be added|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Good players should be able to do that. in "My 60 memorable games" chess champion Bobby Fisher included several of his own defeats too.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The open room is back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, the tables are not linked so that won't help a lot as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems lovely|pg||
nt|casenjo:  it appears to be 17-6 Strul after the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Sry |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am tempted to predict that this will be the world's flattest 3NT. We will see.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even Reese was self-deprecating at times. 'I am about to play a diamond when, at the last minute, I realise that...'|pg||
nt|dima:  The bidding was the same|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 4@s wasn;'t cold, but it would have been more interesting to watch than 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Gromov played it quickly|pg||
nt|dima:  THAT is true :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only difference is that Helgemo's 1@D was 4+ but could have been balanced|pg||
nt|dima:  And playing Precision you dont have a lot of power to make 4@s after opening at most 24 points so go with 7-card suit|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Reese called those 7411 girafe hands or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: quick break|pg||
nt|dima:  Kibs suggest swans and cologne :)|pg||
nt|dburn: both correct|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case Reese claimed that those hands should be played in 7-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range for NS weak 2s is 6-12   it's been a long long time since i've seen that range|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This will be another push.Fleisher needs to pick up 32 imps in 8 boards|pg||
nt|mich-b: sorry all , have to leave now, enjoy the rest|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Guess right now north is talking about previous hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: starting now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Already ahead of you|pg||
nt|iceking: very strong set so far for the swedes|pg||
nt|bessi2: deknijff milking many small swings this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Short break now|pg||
nt|lml: I have to head out now too.  Thanks everybody.|pg||
nt|paulg:  bye Linda|pg||
nt|paulg:  another decision -- 1@d, 1NT or double after Cayne's 1@c opener?|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT would probably be effective here, but is potentially quite dangerous|pg||
nt|henryb:  I confess I would bid 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: And they're back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer v Zaleski halftime score  34 - 33 in favor of Meltzer|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: may depend on vulnerability to an extent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+!C|nt|dburn: well, if North can have 12 then South should bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only qualifier on their CC is  "may be light 3rd favorable vul"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know is not a popular view, but i go for swings on every board at this stage|pg||
nt|ritong: brad would open 1NT easily|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: When you have put your foot into it 50 times, you cease worrying about the 51st time.|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8 team here in R8 are very international: 8 players from Italy, 4 from Norway, 6 from Bulgaria, 4 from France, 2 from Sweden , 2 from Egypt - and a lot of US-players|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room operator catching up|pg||
nt|dima:  Try :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids, North may take the view that his 6-4 shape entitles him to show a maximum|pg||
nt|iceking: you get alot of joy writing plus score after plus score |pg||
nt|dinos1: every lead was the only perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note 2@C is natural     many now play  over the 2+ opener that  1@C-2@D shows Michaels|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: standing after 3. segment: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I was surprised that the other room didn't bid 7D on 53 or 6D on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: but a good pair needs an active guy and a calm one:)|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Would not MANY of us think it is maximum even within 6-12 range|pg||
nt|dburn: and if all of that comes to pass, North-South will reach a pushy game that they will not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe replies to 2N :(|pg||
nt|ady: game in either major for n/s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dinos1: 5@d now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: If EW get to 3NT defense needs to play @ss before declarer unblocks @ds|pg||
nt|dinos1: then @s lead will let it make|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfer responses opposite 1@C nowadays|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They know they need it|pg||
nt|iceking: another good spot |pg||
nt|paulg:  this will be a few imps back for Cayne|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|po-s: are yoy sure about 4H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now will Cayne show @S support?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h is -1 on @d promotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry should be more forceful about that    now Cayne will show 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we think Hampson DBL was Responsive  [takeout for @H & @S] ??|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|poohbear: i guess they still have @c entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: first step OK right sided NTs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: exactly|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Dawson Mahaffey and the DIamond match were both only 4 imp differences going into the 4th quarter|pg||
nt|cicus: Versace has gadget over 1ba openinig: 3@c = 5@h/4@s GI|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks spec for info|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: artificiality follows, as they say|pg||
nt|ritong: they certainly have a way to reach 2@d|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 3NT is the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: hang on a minute - I hadn't thought of that game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line now looks to be win diamond,draw two trumps then play diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South shouldl not anticipate anything strange|pg||
nt|fifee: same contract at the other table. same lead|pg||
nt|ritong: but braddy considers this contract with some disdain:-)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N now?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brolucius: 2@C is check-back, looking for a spade or heart fit.|pg||
nt|dima:  Apparently neither did Becker :)|pg||
nt|dburn: neither had Becker, though I am not sure he was allowed to overrule his partner - depends on the details of their agreements|pg||
nt|iceking: very nice lead unlucky Duboin doesnt have Jack stiff of clubs|pg||
nt|jlrice: good lead by moss    only lead to set the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their convention card describes 3@H as 4@S LR --  6-11 hcp is quite a range for that|pg||
nt|jlrice: but they still might not set it    as could be from a number of different holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now aren't you glad you're wearing your seat belts?|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe the rules are: direct 3NT = shut up, 2NT+3NT = allowed to think?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not keen on 3@H, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahem   NOW cayne will show 3@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: lol|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not making on diamond leads  aas kib pointed out|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d lead wd beat 5@d too|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  The opponents hold 18 HCP and 10 hearts and never entered the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really matter -- 3N is fine contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  me too, i like to bid what i have, especially which such great spots in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond jack lead may set this|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Sometimes the Moysian fit is right, both 3NT and 4 spades work on this hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: no|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, no - @sJ is falling :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: I guess West would lead a club against 3NT, and in practice it would not make either|pg||
nt|pelu: big problems with communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin can duck spades twice and then i count only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opponents can take 2 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the last trick|pg||
nt|pelu: but are there 9 tricks for decl?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south only has 2 clubs, he will probably have togive stansby the heart and spade in dummy|pg||
nt|dinos1: so +1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: @h lead to save an imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2NT=asking, usually balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D=1 suiter in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H=At least 1 top honour in spades, 3@S=6+@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think 3 hearts is Smolen, 4 hearts, 5 spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: I am told they are playing 'a sort of Blue Club'.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think actually the defense is easy, declarer almost certainly has the actual shape|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: I am glad they wrote this out for you Andy,  we were slightly lost |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually clear that 6NT by North is best - maybe 6@s by North is better|pg||
nt|dima:  Hmmm can declarer drop @h King now?|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess at double dummy this may have a chance also, but in practice I doubt very much that Becker will make it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Well, at least my prediction of 'world's most obvious 3NT' did not go down the chute. Not that I was sticking my neck out very far with that. |pg||
nt|casenjo:  So,it would appear things are splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes suggests even breaks|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 6 from France|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: difficult lead for Fallenius|pg||
nt|pelu: lead in OR: @s4 to King and @D back|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you he has knocked out the right ace|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can now get home|pg||
nt|ritong: i am extremely biased in this table composition, but not to the point to say " wd brad"  i just hate passing his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: who cares if they have an other occasion to balance|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jlrice: same defense as the other table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: mm|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: going down in 6NT means @ss5/0 offfside|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria claimed and Moss is shaking his head|pg||
nt|poohbear: I predict greco will be shaking his head|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: that's his normal play for sure|pg||
nt|dima:  low @h now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dropping the singleton K wouldn't have worked anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Gitelman apologises|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: see how fredin-fallenius 2M convention earned that 7 imps swing on board 23, the bidding progresses quite differently if opened 1M as you can see at the other table|pg||
nt|po-s: strange play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: are e/w even going to get ace of @H?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not exactly the highest scoring match in history|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: plus bad luck in @ds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if south wins declarer has nine this way|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i see down 1 now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dima:  Getting maximum out of it|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hands seem to have settled down from yesterday|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: sure it would - two top spades, three more rounds of hearts and West is down to all clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still loses one trump|pg||
pc|cT|nt|casenjo:  he has now forced them to break clubs for him,,guaranteeing his contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this costs a dummy entry and gives up on establishing diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but it does force them in some layouts to break clubs|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but he cannot go down now, on any lie of the cards|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nicely done by Bjorn|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fifee: EW can probably make a couple of @Hs |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: when going down in 6@s simply happens with a @h ruff|pg||
pc|d5|mc|12|nt|pelu: we can see all 52 cards - and we are not sure - and decl - and defense only 16 - diff for them|pg||
nt|dinos1: what about choice of game: E doesnt have @d void (wd pass X of 3@c with 5@c), no pts in @c's (see 3@c bid), so must have @s stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco just asked about how many diamonds Versace held and Versace said eight. So no, no shaking :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Everyone's walked out of the room for a small break|pg||
pg||
qx|c57|st||md|3SJ2HA32D9CAQJ9743,SQH75DAQT87654CKT,S987543HKJ94DJ32C,SAKT6HQT86DKC8652|sv|e|mb|p|nt|dburn: but if West at the other table does open at the one level, I suppose it might go 1@s-1NT-2@h-4@h even|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|chip: other room got to 3H after 1S opening, will likely make for 1 IMP to cayne.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: this is tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad is writing something, probably that Fred would bid a 4 card Major before a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|an|<3 !ds?|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Fred asks about 3@c and Duboin says natural|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|nt|phil: their food is good|pg||
nt|chip: winning contract for EW is 3N, though 5D makes on a non-heart lead. 5S suggests a mixup over 3C.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad points to 3@c and Sementa says it shows @s support|pg||
mb|d|nt|phil: sry private|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3NT certainly East-West's best spot, but almost impossible to reach that (or indeed to make it with this diamond division, allthough North might have to lead a heart)|pg||
nt|dburn: but 5@s is... well, clearly Sementa and Duboin are on very different wavelengths|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Some Italian discussion - this time I'm guessing it's about whether 3@c was natural or spade support|pg||
nt|chip: 800 down or so. some danger of EW crashing their trump tricks I think.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|dburn: always struck me as odd that even the best pairs seem to have difficulty bidding minors naturally after the opponents have opened in the suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: here, for example, simplest is to play 2@c as natural and 2@d as a cue bid for spades|pg||
nt|chip: Since the 1C opening was 3+ S had no immediate way to show a decent hand with clubs. Now a heart shift is sort of normal with that club suit.|pg||
nt|chip: yes, I play that way. though perhaps he thought he was too good for 2C.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: no doubt that's what Sementa thought Duboin would do|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chip: while the spade Q would work on this hand, partner could have better hearts and worse spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can play it as natural and forcing if you like - then, you can't be too good for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad fingering clubs, so probably thinking about limiting the discards by pitching a club on this|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, there are seven boards to play after this one and the margin could well be 20 IMPs or so to Diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: keeps moving one club then the other to the end of his hand, then looking at things some more|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|sK|pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh sorry -- looking at trump in isolation|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think if he played on spades first, then throw south in with a diamond he MIGHT make it|pg||
nt|pelu: The 2 paies here are known for slow play|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure he discarded heart q on diamond ace |pg||
nt|po-s: I¬¥d hope so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Everyone seems to be upset about how each other are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who want confirmation   bbo handles  Cayne=jec  Seamon=miamiwiz|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Last board now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 card suit but only 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scorecard shows a push  but lost opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer leads Zaleski by 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and forgot pulled 3N to 4@H  --  i'll go back to sleep now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D, unbal, 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  Nicely defended - @d lead does not look automatic on the bidding|pg||
nt|po-s: I bet the recorder discarded the wrong card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy - please thank the players for us|pg||
mb|1C!|an|artificial strong|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West might have employed Michaels (2@H to show spades and a minor). That is not good when you have six spades and five in the minor, but OK when the suits are this way round.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Passell may wind up going for a large number|pg||
nt|dima:  NS may find a way to 4@h now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could have led an old sock and declarer wouldn't have got close to making|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Really? Versace is one of the fastest|pg||
nt|fifee: no makable game here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|dinos1: good result in OR|pg||
nt|poohbear: good? more like sensational|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12+HCP, 5+!H|nt|pelu: N has @D to get in|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another bid diamond hand.....there have been lots today|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@S might make if @S are guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The clock has just beeped for the end of the 2nd segment so they have done pretty well |pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the week we've see a couple of pairs who could NOT overcall 1N with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: floppying to 3 nt again |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Everything's well now. Scoreline correct|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3NT is a much easier contract than 4Hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but 4@sX might be even better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fredin is also pretty quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: really?|pg||
nt|iceking: 100% sure he did|pg||
nt|iceking: no suport dbl here dbl just shows good hand |pg||
nt|fifee: interesting auction :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Roland will not doubt be saying how easy slam is here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12+ HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|2C|an|!C's or NT hand|nt|pelu: what to bid in W : 4@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  looking for action?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C agrees hearts and 3@S shows a shortage.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought that if South bid a simple 4@h Passell might bid 4@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Grant Baze: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dima:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: may or may not be a good time for the dread four-card-suit overcall|pg||
nt|dima:  This will take some handling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a good slam in trailing team terms|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, a possible place to pickup|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not cold but good enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they play a convention we rarely see   Raptor 1N shows 4 of other major plus unknown minor|pg||
mb|2S|an|4 card !S|nt|ahollan1: the fact that 1@D is always unbal will help Strul with @C|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h isn't at all a bad contract, but the breaks aren't great|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still is hard to imagine an auction that will reach it|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess we miss a pass|pg||
nt|dinos1: hand for namyats?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: transfer response to 1@C, and 2@D artificial game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe had stansby bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what they do after the 1N bid :(|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: South's hand was too slam-worthy for Brogeland to bid 4@H, probably. 3NT will show no shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Strul will have a good picture after defence takes 3 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont u like my 4@c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: have not seen it yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh what is 4c, would be splinter for me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fallenius is the slowest of the four|pg||
nt|cicus: do they talk much?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah   thanks Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  A long time ago, in the semi-finals of the Wagar, I correctly calculated that we were trailing going into the last board, so I put my partner in 6 spades, they led their ace and she claimed and we went on to win the match by 4 and the event|pg||
nt|bessi2: strange method|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob bid slam now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Just trying to do my job the best I can!|pg||
mb|3C|an|natural|nt|vugraphzfe: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The only slow Italian pair is Fantunes, mainly because of Fulvio :)|pg||
nt|cicus: W is a luckier hand for declaring 3NT..  will avoid @C lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is much better on W than on E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither pair plays a form of Namyats to differentiate good vs random 4M openers|pg||
nt|poohbear: cause with balanced hand Greco should have 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H = no major, 3@S = transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: when S gets the lead later and leads a @D, decl should either duck or put up the K|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, all it needs is the @d finesse and break, or lots of good things|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks guys|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting that neither pair has a tool to show a real 4H|pg||
nt|dinos1: thx all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Restart is at 20:00 local time so that's in 2hours from now|pg||
nt|dinos1: no 2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry Al didn¬¥¬¥t see you|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not crazy about the opening bid with only 4 losers -- maybe would have bid differently if @S instead of @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks and bye|pg||
nt|po-s: of course if you use Namyats partner never has what it takes anyway|pg||
mb|3H|nt|casenjo:  They did not bid the slam at the other table, it was VERY skinny|pg||
nt|fabsayc: were you captain?|pg||
nt|iceking: well you either play support dbl or you play it this way |pg||
nt|bessi2: 9 of diamonds ?|pg||
nt|iceking: what else|pg||
nt|iceking: will never lead spade i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3nt should be slam interest |pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if the 6-1 diamond break will help declarer in the play. Even if a diamond is led, declarer can play a spade at some stage and West will have no further diamond to play.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  No, Woolsey|pg||
nt|bessi2: well could be sooo right to lead a spade, if for instance you cant cash you spade tricks quickly when and if pd gets on lead|pg||
nt|iceking: well  he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|poohbear: they even have the advantage of having rightsided it in NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6N by N is good slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|poohbear: communications are a problem though|pg||
mb|4S|an|keycard in hearts|nt|sybarra: and not much to do here,  +/- an imp again |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I love these transfer auctions, no one has what they bid anymore, everything is artificial|pg||
nt|casenjo:  It was in the bulletin this week, if you dug way down to look at past winners, but who cares about past winners?|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure most would lead diamond 9 here |pg||
nt|poohbear: lets say a @c lead  giving nothing. What does declarer do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Duboin pointed out that he's going to make upon seeing dummy|pg||
nt|jlrice: not the best lead for the defense but funny that it was chosen in both rooms|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s KC in @H|pg||
mb|5D|an|2KC without !HQ|nt|fabsayc: at least these ones are easy to understand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is easier to do if captain, otherwise you sort of need a lisence|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  spades must be 4-4, diamonds 4-4, @h 4-1 so ...|pg||
nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Captain got to be declarer|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: easy for him |pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is a good player|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably about to claim |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North would have bid 2NT if he held four hearts. 3@C shows only three-card support.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the play will be simple: @cA, @sA, @c ruff, and claim|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he has a chance if he can draw the right inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  I think the contract will be made|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's got to play the @C 10 from his hand before he draws the last 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D [from auction]  4@S  so either  4441 or 4144|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred lead @D|pg||
nt|dinos1: as West)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right -- North declaring here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: some relay sequences nobody but the players know what the bids mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: time for auction, time for explanations, time to figure out who's on lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  With five @d tricks, you can force 3@s and AKAK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  the space-saving strong club pair do not seem to have got very close either, so perhaps unrealistic to expect the more natural pair to find it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: he only needs three tricks in clubs, so he doesn't have an entry problem|pg||
nt|dima:  yes|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Meckwell have picked up 13 imps thus far, this quarter and now trail by 31 (i think) :)|pg||
nt|kit: this will be harder than it might appear, with bad club split|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: this is the situation I was referring to|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|warrens:  the diamond Q makes it much easier|pg||
nt|bessi2: fallenius must keep all his diamonds to hold this to 9 tricks i think|pg||
nt|kit: now we are going to see a very long huddle I predict|pg||
nt|dinos1: problems with communications|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi Kit, welcome :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fifee: 4@S in the Open room which would probably go down except that they had the @HK lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: and placed in S - in the newspapers S is the hero :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: note that with this combination needing four tricks and intending to play West for length, you should cash the king and lead the ten|pg||
nt|kit: We can see how it is cold, of course, but from declarer's point of view this is a nightmare|pg||
nt|kit: well, now it will be easy|pg||
nt|dinos1: play for hKx?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|casenjo:  Yes, I always sit South and East|pg||
pc|h4|nt|casenjo:  Because I live in the Southeast :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what if @HK doesn't drop under ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hampson: "Things are lookin up"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well moot point now|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needs the H king dbltn or the @h king off with the Spade finesse on|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Now he can cash 1 club and safely take spade hook|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|dburn: better to play this by North - pretty ropey on this diamond lead from West|pg||

nt|dburn: or a miracle when it isn't|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would not help West much to duck the @SA. Declarer could win and later throw a loser on the @SQ, conceding a spade trick and setting up the @SJ for a further discard. |pg||
nt|dima:  Match is very close now |pg||
nt|dburn: well done Strul - that overcall was a solo effort, but there was nothing shabby about his play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may have a two opening for this hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  another missed opportunity and running out of driving space|pg||
nt|cicus: of course I don't imply @DQ was the wrong play|pg||
nt|iceking: this will probably be push though normal spot|pg||
nt|paulg:  so each pair has now missed a slam that could have been bid, so will be slightly nervous at the score up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier didn't we see Fred or Brad bid 2@C=@C and another after their NT overcall was DBLed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yeap we did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so -- i wonder why Brad didn't bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably @D & and major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4432 not enough for escape|pg||
nt|jlrice: probably because they treat 4-4 hands as balanced   and that would show unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange -- that gave up on overtrick if West somehow held @SKx|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a good slam here - only @s 3-0 in S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds like reasonable differentiator to me|pg||
nt|jlrice: could also be that he just was planning on letting Fred play 1NTX|pg||
nt|jlrice: figuring they might not want to run|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  Probably would hold it to 4, but not beat the contract|pg||
nt|fifee: 4@S making 5 on board 42 in the Open Room 13 imps |pg||
nt|henryb:  Note that after the 2@h response showing an A or 2K, there was no need for Seamon to do more than rebid 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as Kit said -- finesse was safe if only cash 1 @C|pg||
mb|2H|an|5!S5m|nt|brolucius: Some would double on the West hand, hoping to survive a removal if partner responded in clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Something like 4@C may be a fit jump now. But they could play it as a splinter. More likely. |pg||
nt|henryb:  depends whether a conversion to @d would show extra values. Sharp division of opinion on so called "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like to show clubs as well as diamonds, rather than name a shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  And now Precision might place the declarership of @h contract in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|3!H lim+|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is the only strong bid for EW  [2N is artificial]|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt now or |pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT is a @h raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another "fun" hand |pg||
nt|dima:  Oh but we get @s overcall sirely|pg||
nt|kit: South's double of 4@H in other room looks reasonable, but not a success|pg||
mb|3C|an|artificial asking|nt|sybarra: making 4 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT feels like the spot|pg||
nt|dinos1: good 3@c bid - now 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe you could make a slam if you were in it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are hoping to show two matches from tomorrow and onwards, but it depends on operator availability|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could |pg||
nt|ritong: aker will not like this holding in @c shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: @d singleton is not yummy either|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a good hand apart from that - 4@c something of an overbid, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 4@H denies shortage he had no choice. It's too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|ritong: on the bright side, the ninth trump and relatively solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H 5+@H, game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gues not|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to find the @D-lead against 6@s - @dQ go on @h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  another case of DOIGB|pg||
nt|henryb:  Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I don't like that bid, 2 diamonds was cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Drury |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with 5@D. It is a gamble but it might cause South a problem if he had a good hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course 4@s would have been better bridge: down 2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  should Boye overtake and try to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East has not bought well, because partner is short in her second suit. That is why a fit-jump can work well, allowing partner to judge the fit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure East is strong enough for a fit-jump|pg||
nt|dima:  Now need to drop @c Q offside in 6NT from East - tall order|pg||
nt|dburn: lead could be changing hands here - these have been mighty blows by Strul and his cohorts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some who play multi can open 2M with his hand type|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  3@s might be a serious slam try|pg||
nt|ritong: no fear|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, thought it was semi-nat)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|casenjo:  a free bid of 3 clubs, followed by supporting diamonds could excite west when they do have a double fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if 4@C would be a splinter, you could try 3@C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might have to do that at the five level|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and keep them out of trouble when they don't have the double fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @d support, I mean|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East been a passed hand, most players would say that 3@C did show a diamond fit as well.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i do|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 'support non-jump' some call it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or balanced with no @S stop?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another miss opportunity|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Jo Anne|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think that this last hand could have been bid to slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  another hand that is not too stressful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't been keeping official records   was that crash  3 or  4?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 3 i think|pg||
nt|jlrice: they must have good internet connection at the site|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss asks if the lead is 3rd/5th,  Lauria said usually yes but partner's suit might not be|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well @d gauanteed 5 imps no matter what|pg||
nt|kit: Here declarer doesn't have reason to believe hearts are as bad as they are -- but he knows spades are 5-1|pg||
nt|kit: So it might be right to lead a low spade from dummy, finding out what South's singleton is|pg||
nt|kit: However, if North has a singleton club, which is quite possible on bidding and lead, declarer needs to draw some trumps|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl has no entries to fin @h twice|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dima:  They found @h fit already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way Diamond in good position with 8@H making inthe other room|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S kickback?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Roland make this for us !|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: East says 4@C is splinter with a good hand like 20 in hcp (?)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been declaring beautifully tonight, let's see how he does here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict he will try to ruff a heart|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make with all cards in view|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure |pg||
nt|ritong: he will think for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the never are for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (btw, I put this hand down and say "always the challenge by me pard,  gl"|pg||
nt|ritong: "natural" approach of the @ds is to ruff one, in case of drop, then decideif north follows to the third round|pg||
nt|ritong: which would not be the case|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is an other detail to cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be a different ballgame on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the losing @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, declarer has a couple of options|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Closed Room is also in 6@H on a club lead from South|pg||
nt|ritong: @c lead is more friendly|pg||
nt|iceking: diamond ace and w will play diamond 8 or|pg||
nt|bessi2: relatively easy 300|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H6 interesting [confusing?] choice of lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace has probably already planned the defence - he's wandering around playing with his hair waiting for Moss to play a card|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|casenjo:  looks like a good place for trick  10|pg||
nt|cicus: now I call that aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|cicus: I thought it will be NS in game|pg||
nt|ritong: this should even 2@h just made|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dima:  And the match has a new leader|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play finished in the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The players there will be having desset when this table shows up for dinner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even without the overcall - Dubinin was going to bid @H first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: dessert  even|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the trumps are a little weak however, so maybe not|pg||
nt|iceking: finally starting to understand the italian carding :)|pg||
nt|po-s: what was eight? even discouraging? and heart honour|pg||
nt|iceking: scores are up in other matches|pg||
nt|fifee: 1NT by N at the other table. @SJ led|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss has been know to go very deep into the tank|pg||
nt|dinos1: if lead @s now I mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 56  Meltzer +30 over Zaleski|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: This is a bridge match, not a marriage ceremony.|pg||
nt|iceking: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|iceking: its round of 8 going on |pg||
nt|iceking: Jacobs is 41 up against Zaleski Strul is 31 up against Meltzer Dawson is 16 up against Diamond|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: even if declarer gets tapped with @ds, in 2 @h, this makes a grand total of 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: if somebody can ruff third heart with short trump he could go down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fallenius must have been close one would assume|pg||

nt|pelu: also diff for Versace-Lauria to explain :):):)|pg||
nt|cicus: I have set a new record at receiving 2674 messages in one minute|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thats not a record I can assure you|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how declarer can come to 10 tricks from here -- battle may be down 1 vs. down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  on 57  Nunes holding the 8@D bid 3@D over 1@C and sold out to 4@C   Meltzer lead down to 19  thru 57|pg||
nt|poohbear: with swing boards coming|pg||
nt|dinos1: not clear how to make at all even after @s opening lead. Sementa didnt insert @s9 and let @s8 pull trump|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: I am asked what Kickback is. To save space, some use a cheaper bid (4@S here) to ask for aces. It can be particularly important if a minor has been agreed when you can't afford a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: response above the trump suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no pre-nup?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but, he only has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, sometimes they bid one more and go down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  5 spades, 3  hearts and 1 club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has heart diamond squeeze on a different layout|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb:  woops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: apologies to Nunes    Fantoni didn't open 2nd seat holding  AKTx  QTxx K xxxx   systemically his only option was 1N - if he counted @DK as worth values|pg||

pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Strul went down in 3NT on the deal that I predicted would be boringly flat in 3NT. That is a high price to pay, just to make me look stupid. |pg||

nt|Walddk4: I predict that N-S will not bid to the same contract in this room. Any bets? :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No Roland! but 3@d on NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North was upset with the forcing auction with east only having 6 pts|pg||
nt|cicus: I regret to say I am not likely to see the result of this quarter tonight|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2cl was forcing to 2dia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does Fredin want to dictate how Lauria should bid?|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess W did not want to play 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east explain a bid that north didnt ask about|pg||
nt|cicus: for me E's bidding did sound like a slam invitation|pg||
nt|iceking: 4h was making so 300 isnt bad result |pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Diamond will open 1NT (13+ to 16)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|casenjo:  I'm too pedestrian, I would have overtaken trick one and tried to cash my aces :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: South went to bed with the @CA...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't they have a hot-dog stand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hot-dog in New Orleans?  sounds blasphemous|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: yes, I'm sure thats the collective choice of the Lynch team :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  slightly offshape, but more descriptive than a Precision 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C still 2+|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace just jokingly saying to Greco that if he had doubled it would probably make as it's very hard to run the @H8|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: spade over call   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good idea with almost 2000 kibs and several commentators sitting like vultures on a branch, watching your every move.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might try 5@D?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a player messaged me "a 6D PUNT!?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: A tricky bid, anyway.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I answered: this would be the hand for it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would bid 3@s, then 5@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he bids 5@D, North will bid 6@D. A vulnerable 5@D bid deserves respect and they HATE missing a slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: whoops|pg||
nt|fifee: hehe|pg||
nt|ritong: the least he must do is 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: imho|pg||
nt|ritong: but|pg||
nt|ritong: opponents are at fav|pg||
nt|ritong: it would not be a big surprise if the par was some doubled @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: East isnt happy not sure why|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: did Fred pass?|pg||
nt|ritong: we have a doubt:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and usually their bidding does too|pg||
nt|ni hao: hi rick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dima:  E was allowed toplay in 2@h .. and NS are close to 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@s easy - NS even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  There were lots of imps to be had this quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: now Fredin must be satisfied at seeing this pedestrian weak 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, it's too strong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: he may call the TD again|pg||
nt|bessi2: true|pg||
nt|iceking: 3nt here should make cards are friendly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: disciplined jeff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  that jump might be enough to turn Boye on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: close?|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|dima:  Now they are IN :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take some effort to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I am doing my best!|pg||
nt|ritong: and if they do not have enough @cs for that purpose|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If North bids 4@h, South will almost surely try 6@d|pg||
nt|reisig: 16 X 4 = 64|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i'm with you henry, but Boye thought otherwise|pg||
nt|brolucius: 50-50 now that North will add a sixth diamond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I too am often wrong|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I still like your bid after the jump to game|pg||
nt|jlrice: I am surprised Versace passed this out after his partner opened 4 vul vs not|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  you are TERRIFIC!!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np, your doing fine|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Are you perched on a stool above the table, craning your neck to see what is going on?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil may cue bid spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and im trying to hear but i cant hear anything|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For those watching, that have not seen the vugraph room itself, this is a painful experience!!!! The screens are in the way, the players are in the way and the operator is trying to insert alerts and comments while following bidding and play|pg||
nt|kit: this looks like fairly flat 4@S, making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d4-4 so 5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: now the natural version of gazzilli|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have long hearts to bid 4@H. 5@D still shows a giant hand via the double.|pg||
nt|phil: Strul piling it on|pg||
nt|dburn: better not let them play it, then|pg||
nt|dima:  -300 is better then -620|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4NT if ace asking is commital, but it could be a spade cue bid|pg||
nt|iceking: iam not going to guess what these bids mean |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco has just opened his 2nd can of Red Bull. This is my first time vugraphing Greco-Hampson for today so I do not know if it was the 2nd can of the day/night :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Now the odds favor playing East for the missing @HQ. That is the Theory of Vacant Places. West has six spades to East's two, so East has more vacant places to hold the @HQ.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 4@S as the ace asking bid|pg||
nt|cicus: now N can ruff a club but only at the cost of a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|ritong: it means that brad has a lot of them, so hands won t fit|pg||
nt|fifee: good logic henri|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I'm sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  for those using the web client, you might now see a very strange auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that undos are causing a problem|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Again they try to make me look stupid!|pg||
nt|phil: saves about 3 IMPs here|pg||
nt|pelu: also 4@s on 59 in OR - and @c-lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another marginal slam, normally just what you want when trailing|pg||
nt|cicus: unfortunate lead, the spade trick has vanished|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last board North would have defended differently |pg||
nt|ritong: i guess this is the reason why fred did not offer to go higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  leave the table and return and you will get the right auction and declarer|pg||
nt|paulg:  a problem I'll tell Fred about when he's finished in New Orleans :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For some reason the score on 55 was changed so Cayne gained 10 IMPs. The 4@H= next door has been changed to 3@H+1|pg||
nt|dburn: usually 8 IMPs or so better - here, only 3 IMPs better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH got away with murder in the open room, entire set more or less, and if it had not been for Gromov-Dubinin at this table it could have been worse for Lynch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on our slam hand  58  -- both tables in the other match played 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: i dont do those switches, they require huge amounts of discussion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anyway 5@C is plenty high enough|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, these guys know their stuff, we have not had any bidding misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 12 on cross ruff, but i expect a trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually he does not, club nine will overruff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn can overruff with the nine and shift to a club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score both 5 and 8 of clubs for cross ruff to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace a little surprised seeing the jack|pg||
nt|jlrice: would have figured he would X or bid on as has a few hcp  and what looks to be a couple good cards for partner|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: 2@h clarifying|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do they tell difference?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @H  I see |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gazzilli strikes for the second time in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: lauria s overcall with the boss suit makes it a little different|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps it is time for USA to take a look at this!!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the match is virtually over with this one and after the change on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: i know bart bramley already had a serious look at it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Passell is trying to beat 5D, he would make a differnt lead vs slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one sucks, but it makes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: and he certainly has colleagues|pg||
nt|dburn: used to be called Cole in the old days|pg||
nt|sybarra: so David what made it Gazilli?|pg||
nt|ritong: the name of its creator|pg||
nt|ritong: in italy|pg||
nt|casenjo:  there was one that needed trump 2-2 and an ace onside: not a good slam, but it was there for the desperate ones|pg||
nt|pelu: the best slam is 6@c - no danger of @C-ruff|pg||
nt|jlrice: did not figure out to give spade ruff so will just be -1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Gitelman claiming, asks for spade finesse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: 1d-1sp-1nt-3nt would be natural for standard bidders|pg||
nt|bessi2: let me guess then.. 1N transfer showing clubs or some GF hands.. 2d showed bal GF 2N nat, 3c asking for Major, 3d showed 4c hearts  :)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, rho did not raise @ss|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: beter not return a club...|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 1NT might have been forcing to game|pg||
nt|iceking: S is asking i been told 1nt GF relay|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dima:  Now @c Ace is safe|pg||
nt|dburn: wasn't all that clear for North to bid 2@s, as Passell did, but if 2@h had come back to South (as it did at the other table) Strul would probably have had another go|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Cole is not as comprehensive as Gazzilli|pg||
nt|iceking: 2clubs shows hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: can set 5th @c now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: so Bessi obv way off|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed that is also very possible, i once played 1d-1N GF relay str8 from Lindkvist, Fredins former partner|pg||
nt|iceking: 2d relay 2nt was either 5d 4h or 6d 5h|pg||
nt|iceking: 3clubs was relay and 3diamonds was 11-13hcp 2-4-5-2 there you go|pg||
nt|po-s: Fallenius used to play with Lindkvist too|pg||
nt|bessi2: swedes are excellent in developing ideas in the bidding|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed pairs like Meckwell have taken alot of there ideas from sweden |pg||
nt|bessi2: swedes have few rivals in that department|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|ritong: a small hint, but induces that brad has two of them|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: but that swedish attribute can be difficult on the kibitzers as one just pointed out to me :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg:  aside from the slam possibilities the hands have been quiet and accompanied by solid play .. hence the low score|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: Bill Cole lived in Italy?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can ruff two diamonds high to assure making|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the key moment|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: You can also have the version with 89 pages if you wish|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Boye would have found the heart queen anyway and made 6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: may not get the entire count on the hand for the trump play|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nice play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Maybe not 2@S, David, but double would not have been an overbid to show some life. After all, partner overcalled at the 2-level vulnerable vs not|pg||
nt|dima:  Well spades are 5-4 (no weak 2) at least 5 clubs (usually 6) and @h K per inference - enough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, you have to count tricks carefully|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The auction was identical in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Send an e-mail to Mr Garozzo|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: for the specs,  at this level of play,  the conv. cards are decoration,  the systems notes are 200 pages|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many more for some|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Meckwell for example|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: yes indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What happened here?|pg||

nt|sybarra: 322..........ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: I certainly thought that, somehow, they would get to 6@D. In the slam-bidding area, they more often get too high than stay low.|pg||
nt|phil: well 4225 is posible, but s/v @d is more likely for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - both North and South at the other table expressed varying degrees of timidity|pg||
nt|pelu: was that the best play? - if @cs dont work - better only to take 2x @s|pg||
nt|bessi2: trying to teach you anything is an exercise in futility iceking :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Fred and Brad allowed them an IMP?|pg||

nt|reisig: hiya Henri :)|pg||
nt|fifee: hi boss :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: indeed david|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At this point Lynch ventured a semi-psychic 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: good for her|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for her to do playing Big Club|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess Icelandic relay is just as difficult|pg||
nt|reisig: Hi Pat :)|pg||
nt|reisig: 52-1 is a huge set|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the Italians had some weird mixup in the closed room|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s? misunderstanding in OR?|pg||
mb|3C!|an|art, invitational with !H's|nt|pelu: 5@d by West has a - small - chance - 4@S by NS also a chance|pg||
nt|casenjo:  bergen raise|pg||
nt|pelu: is the S hand a strong og weak Bergen?|pg||
nt|pelu: or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Sementa not fully recovered from whatever illness had him leaving in middle of 2nd set for hospital|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: meanwhile, back at the bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Rigal back in it, it's not over just yet|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with +1430|pg||
nt|brolucius: When I asked Boye to explain an auction in this year's Euro championship where they had bid to 6@S missing the ace and king of trumps, he replied: 'Ah, that was a great bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: problem! You must put it into the book.'  Then he explained all his thoughts to me during the bidding. A real treat.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So EW decided not to play there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=10-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks weak|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like they play 15-17nt |pg||
nt|iceking: most swedes use 14-16nt opening|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting pass from Cayne, as he knows that the hand will be opened at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to their CC    Hampson-Greco playing "modified bergen"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Another potential danger|pg||
nt|caitlin: broad range |pg||
nt|casenjo:  too good for a preempt wiith the singleton ace and not quite enough for Bergen, so he made an aggressive choice vul|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 15-17nt vul 14-16 none vul i been told|pg||
nt|po-s: and the relay you are talking about is played by two (2) pairs - and one of them only plays part of it|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it was impossible for me to learn it way to complicated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i've never heard of modification like this|pg||
nt|kit: Now East may consider competing to 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- have you see this 3@C bid before?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||
nt|dburn: making 6@s was not so shabby for the Rigal team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
nt|dburn: one might almost consider that Helgemo ventured a semi-psychic 1NT - that's quite a position with a 14 count facing two bidding opponents and one passing partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lots of partnerships invert the 3@C or 3@D bids, and the double may also change the meanings|pg||
nt|casenjo:  true|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2h is not the most comfortable of contracts but should west lead the K of diamonds then could make|pg||
nt|ritong: a comfortable cushion, i d say|pg||
nt|fifee: they are hot|pg||
mb|3H|nt|po-s: the reason for "partiality" was that the diamond module was too difficult|pg||
nt|iceking: how should he play this maybe in tempo win diamond ace and low spade from dummy?|pg||
nt|bessi2: seems normal|pg||
nt|reisig: There is no such thing...comfortable|pg||
nt|ritong: are there cushions anyway?|pg||
nt|fifee: Brad must have devalued his 4333 14 HCP for 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- same in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace puts on the pass card but takes it off again to ask what Hampson's pass over dbl was|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: And now passes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: He liked his 14 count; I don't blame him|pg||
nt|phil: yes but he has intermediates galore and a ttrick source|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14+ good 5 card suit no psyche in my books:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: marginal whether fredin should bother with stayman|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|kit: no -- perhaps they interchange meaning of 3@C and 3@H -- 3@H being some kind of raise|pg||
nt|poohbear: except one was playing bergen|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D is alerted because they would make a Support Double on all hands containing three-card spade support.|pg||
nt|cicus: now this will be played in game and the many aces would mean defeat|pg||
nt|cicus: S has 2 stoppers but has to give up the lead too many times|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 7 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|cicus: an illustrative example that aces play a big role even at NT's|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Danny|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but with a sixth card, you just play ace and another as your grandmother used to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) its my aunt minnie |pg||
nt|iceking: or low club from dummy that could also work |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: just the lead decl need|pg||
nt|3for3: Some pairs would be able to bid some form of garbage stayman here....|pg||
nt|dinos1: -2 if make 2 @d ruffs|pg||
nt|kit: Defense needs to get diamond ruff -- may not be so obvious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace closes the screen to ask if Greco can have two cards in spades, and the answer was a yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|casenjo:  As Henry predicted EW competed with the ghoulish distribution on board 10 and went for 800|pg||
nt|phil: but here 2@c should get you to 3N as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  puppet stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this is some form of puppet stayman|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: still, no one ever doubles Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H and max|pg||
nt|dima:  Well opposite 2 bidding opponents it is quite a move I would say|pg||
nt|caitlin: true|pg||
nt|dinos1: wd @cJ show @d SP?|pg||
nt|poohbear: could have 3|pg||
nt|kit: Good play by declarer, cutting down defensive communication and forcing them to commit early|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and if RHO follows with the last small card, toss a coin?|pg||
nt|dburn: absolutely, Mr Gallagher. Positively, Mr Sheen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on this hand doesnt matter|pg||
nt|dburn: as to whether you should bid a slam with the information Duboin has at his disposal right now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: only missing the kj,  432|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not brain surgery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fred Gitelman was one of the first to point out the correctness of QT8765 opposite A9; run the Q, says a Canadian spectator (don't shoot the messenger = me)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, only he and the Shadow know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that 2@D was stayman -- all other bids from Gromov would have been natural|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that a club works|pg||
nt|iceking: would not here|pg||
nt|kit: if he had ducked club, that is|pg||
nt|kit: which I think he should have done|pg||
nt|chip: might play a spade now and suffer the ruffs also.|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s9-A- and @s10?|pg||
nt|kit: He will play a spade now, for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: well only a diamond lead beats for sure, not easy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|casenjo:  Meckwell has closed the gap by 1/2...down 22|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have tried diamond jack to gain a second entry to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg:  some might just open 1@s :)|pg||
nt|3for3: I like 1nt|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest so do I, but I guess it means we all lose imps to Versace too|pg||
nt|3for3: We will have a new leader as game made in OR.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a Gazzilli auction?|pg||
nt|jlrice: -2 is a great result for the cayne team as NS can make 3NT if they attack spades instead of hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: duh it was 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the 1@D bid :(|pg||
nt|jlrice: i am suprised it took Lauria so long to bid NTs|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: nah - Fred pointed out the correctness of running the queen with Q10876 facing A9. He and I both know that with six facing two, you should play ace and one|pg||
nt|bessi2: but that play is certainly best as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes - @s10|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: a bit less fun with club lead |pg||
nt|casenjo:  7th push|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR same contract - lead @sA - same result - flat|pg||
nt|pelu: just change @CK and @CA and 3Nt would make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: KNR values it at 18, so it's not just any 14 count|pg||
nt|phil: KNR loves long strong suits and hates short honors|pg||
nt|iceking: but east might have like kjxx and w qxx |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite clear what Dubinin should do now|pg||
nt|dima:  Declarer has to be careful here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however this is probably better, tempting fleisher to cash a diamond or switch to hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: but this looks best|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: now if he believes diamonds 5-3 he can play hearts from hand|pg||
nt|3for3: maybe it is losing to cayne's pass....that was the real swing decision it seems|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dima:  nice play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and loves Aces/Kings  hates Quacks|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|dburn: KNR has never been for 800 in its life. It doesn't understand these things.|pg||

pc|dT|nt|ritong: ite missa est|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Difficult to judge these hands exactly, but both sides had a nine-card fit in their minor. That suggests around 9 tricks each (or 10 and 8, or 8 and 10). So, on that basis bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4 over 4 was doubtful. Particularly as North had a singleton in South's first-bid suit.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|caitlin: what is URL for KNR|pg||
nt|dima:  Sorry was meant private|pg||

nt|bessi2: i think fallenius will surely guess the hearts now|pg||
nt|iceking: yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: trying for count signal in clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: A rough guide on competitive hands is that you should bid to the level of the total number of trumps that you hold in the partnership. (To the three-level with 9 trumps). That is ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the Law of Total tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Worth bookmarking|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fifee: 3NT by N at the other table!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: not sure i like this line|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
mc|6|nt|paulg:  perhaps ... or the fact that Lauria and Versace just bid vulnerable games with little excuse|pg||
nt|kit: yes, somehow doesn't seem just that 3@H and 4@S share the same fate|pg||
pg||
qx|c61|st||md|3S9HQJT9532D962CA5,SA4HA6DKT843CKQ92,SKQJ73H4DAQJ75CT8,ST8652HK87DCJ7643|sv|b|nt|dburn: he has cost himself one of them, but this was probably his safest line - doubtless he believed in 4-4 diamonds and wasn't too worried about other things|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|an|!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this is strange|pg||
nt|dburn: for Lauria and Versace that 3@c would be invitational with long hearts, but there is no mention that Duboin and Sementa play that way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think that Sementa thinks 3@c is a spade raise - weak limit raise from what he said - but it wasn't very clear|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: or at least, there is no mention of it on the card they used for the European Championships in Ostend last month|pg||
nt|dburn: which is the latest one I have for them - there, 3@c is supposed to be a spade raise in the Bergen style|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps this is a very recent change to the system that one or other of them has forgotten|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Director has been called - Sementa told Moss that 3@c was a spade raise with some splinter, weak; Duboin says the agreement is it shows hearts|pg||

pc|h4|nt|dburn: the good news from the North-South point of view is that 4@h was going down also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brad has been fingering the low hearts, but obviously isn't sure - Sementa and Fred say "it doesn't matter"|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Sementa had known what Duboin intended by 3@c, they might have stopped in three|pg||
nt|chip: even 3H down with a D ruff.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||

nt|casenjo:  they are averaging 1.5 imps perboard this quarter|pg||
nt|po-s: only in Denmark do they allow it|pg||
nt|po-s: I¬¥ll suggest it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why pairs bid so many 23 point games -- they're needed to make up for the 26 pointers that go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i know some players who would open this S hand 3clubs|pg||
nt|reisig: This is a tough hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's also a similar version available that doesn't need browser   handeval.exe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bessi2: I am not one of them|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, 4@S can be set on a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that certainly looks better than Moss' early 2@H call|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: indeed - that was Rigal's last chance. Mind you, his North-South pair are going to be hopeful - they have had a very good card, but...|pg||
nt|ritong: a tough match for cayne s boys|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: To open 2@H on the East hand would not be a good bid. (Two side aces). Mind you, there should not really be a gap between 1@H and 2@H, so I would open 1@H.|pg||
nt|po-s: pass now perhaps?|pg||
nt|po-s: and RD by Versace|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2d shows 18-19 or maybe 18-20 bal hand|pg||
nt|reisig: hard to find @h after the opps bid em|pg||
nt|fifee: thats for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Berkowitz found that in the other match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Certainly a pretty big difference|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: not that game is all that much of a contract, I guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is unusual|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this is the 'new' version of Jacoby 2NT, similar to Larry Cohen's write up in the Bulletin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok explain, i missed that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just a guess, 2c asking , 2@d minimum|pg||
nt|iceking: 2d is 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the E hand dont look like minimum|pg||
nt|ritong: fred might bid them, though:)|pg||
nt|ritong: he did|pg||
nt|ritong: as a cue, ofc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all of you club players - in your partnerships do you know if 2@S is forcing or not?|pg||
nt|jlrice: i agree    but almost any weak 2 would be better than moss's previous one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that is no exaggeration from Jon|pg||
nt|chip: might push NS into 6C.|pg||
nt|kit: 6@C is pretty lucky make -- they won't be close to it|pg||
nt|kit: Well, actually afterthis start they just might get there|pg||
nt|chip: I'd say N is about 80% there now.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|casenjo:  Balicki made it easy for partner to beat 5 diamonds dbld on Board 12; he led a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's pass tells partner that he has only two spades to fit the suit shown by the transfer response. |pg||
nt|bessi2: 18-19 it is|pg||
nt|fifee: making game on the last hand. nice pick up for Dawson|pg||
nt|3for3: It is a tad strange to see cayne in the north seat, for those who watch his daily matches on BBO, where he is always south|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for scores in all matches after 16 boards|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2h transfer and 2N super accept I am guessing|pg||
nt|fifee: I think 4@S will make also on this hand|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would assume 2S would have to be forcing unless otherwise discussed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm not saying there is right or wrong answer -- the point is that you need to discuss it |pg||
nt|jlrice: for those that werent here earlier the reference is from board 34|pg||
nt|jlrice: about his previous 2H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is 3nt an unspecified singleton?|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@d will NOT|pg||
nt|fifee: assured|pg||
nt|chip: guess not.|pg||
nt|dinos1: with this @sAQ and ruffing values in @h|pg||
nt|kit: but this is the other 20%|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I wonder if Redouble by North would have been a re-transfer?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3C=minimum, 3D=non min with shortness and 3H, 3S or 3NT vary on partnership agreement|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok your guess is?|pg||
nt|pelu: no better than u :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that's why Marty Bergen played transfer preempts -- his partners could pass before the ratty suit became trump :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to score   Meltzer over Zaleski by 27|pg||
pc|s4|nt|casenjo:  looks like another push|pg||
nt|po-s: wonder if RD by East and pass,pass would be clear to Fredin|pg||
nt|cicus: an 1@C opener rarely has 4@Ds so perhaps 1@H is the percentage bid withthe E hand|pg||
nt|3for3: 3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|reisig: Easy defense, besides|pg||
nt|jlrice: lol|pg||
nt|jlrice: yeah  but Brad's first preempt would have been a good one for Marty  :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@C has six fast losers...|pg||
nt|paulg:  many people prefer South on BBO because the seats then seem to be in the right place ... i guess Cayne has first choice in those matches :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: so 4sp here 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: iam not sure they play 2h transfer here|pg||
nt|bessi2: me neither, but pretty sure lauria-versace do|pg||
nt|po-s: might be transfer to 2NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|po-s: Not sure if perhaps EW play 1C as possibly a doubleton with balanced hands|pg||
nt|iceking: yea i know but it seems Sementa and Duboin dont play any convention|pg||
nt|3for3: East west can, and did make a diamond partial, so no big swing here|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous, especially to our discreet but efficient operator|pg||
nt|sybarra: making a uptrick here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wed don't know which match(es) we will be showing after the dinner break. The only thing to do is turn up and see|pg||
nt|iceking: very standard stuff it looks like|pg||
nt|iceking: 2d denied 5card major and rest is transfers 3club would have been stayman |pg||
nt|iceking: it doesnt say what 2h is on there convention card |pg||
nt|bessi2: 3 imps for cayne here|pg||
nt|kit: so Cayne will need 2 big swings in a row|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: With a weak trump holding, declarer attacks one of the side suits.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results for Wagar [Ladies KO] get posted at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/wagar/|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1@C can be 2 with balanced 12-14  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like S will play on spades and can use @HJ as entry|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that 1C makes|pg||
nt|ritong: but it works backwards too|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told : 11+ here|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb NS feel they are ahead so didnt risk|pg||
nt|chip: So seems we will have a melzer-diamond final. 2nd year in a row in the spingold final for meltzer.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: there is possibility that there will be 4 vugraph tables tonight - either both from spingold [if close matches] or 1 match from each event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bergen's preempts were known for showing approximately 13 cards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: As long as you are back for Finland in 2hrs and 40 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sementa pointing out to Duboin about what a finesse is|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|3for3: easy defense to find, as well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: and diamond looking for compensation for what your team did to them in the trials Chip|pg||
pc|h4|nt|po-s: the duck might cost|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: A heart now will free up a potential winner in that suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer needs two trumps in dummy in order to lead towards the @SQ and then duck to East's @SA.|pg||
nt|jlrice: and probably any 5 cards in the given suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: A diamond will let it through.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depending on operator availability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or - if not enough vugraph operators available -- just one spingold match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  interesting that the pair who opened 1@d never really found their diamond fit, whereas the pair who opened 1@c did|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry, unfortunately I haven't got any extra hands for other scores, but Roland seems to have them :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  tough for EW when the strong hand does not have the shortage|pg||

nt|casenjo:  i believe captaincy is a rare thing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the best bidding: describe your hand to the best of your ability and together get to the best contract|pg||
nt|ritong: if it is a kind of slam try, lauria wants to test their agreements after an interference|pg||
nt|paulg:  N/S are not in a fit auction, other negative to bidding|pg||
nt|jlrice: he has good controls and a known 9 card fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only @DQ of dubious value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can move your mouse over the highlighted bid to see explanation from operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, it's an uncomfortable opening for West playing strong club - less so playing that 1@c shows clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: obviously you have not used a relay system, the philosophy is quite different|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@d= cue or RKC?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think it is RKC|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6542 is not a suit, so if natural i rebid 2@S, not 2@H|pg||
nt|pelu: that the reason that I has never played relay-system :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all it is a hand worth staying in at poker|pg||
nt|casenjo:  When relays come up, or if someone opens a NT range at any level, where their hand is narrowly defined , then captaincy comes up|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But on the rest of the hands description comes into play|pg||
nt|po-s: correct|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder who is thinking now|pg||
nt|reisig: Fred keeping those @ds ..a secret :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@C was too much.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, I'm easy. I go both ways :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D sure looks like blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same way it works when you're playing on bbo|pg||
nt|dinos1: me2 - 1N shdnt promise stopper. N may ask it with 2@s if needed|pg||
nt|chip: I agree.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is forcing to game, with 10 opposite 12-14.|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Jo Anne - and there are no @h"suit" but best describtion|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it does not sound like brad would accept them:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: no after 4@D - the answer is not 5@c - so Cue bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cue bidding is not going to solve this hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR East bid 4@c, 4@D (cue) and then 4NT by East|pg||
nt|harmon: maybe 6 key card so 2 with q of c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe a belated grand slam force by martel|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the heart suit is so anemic, I thought of raising 2 clubs to 3 immediately, instead of patterning out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If that is the case (I agree), there is no need to open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors as is normal in USA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fifee: 4@h is a great bid. has to show the K|pg||
nt|fifee: since fred denied 3 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: i think i means " sorry dude, but no clubs today"|pg||
nt|ritong: it*|pg||
nt|fifee: what would 4@D have said|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: i like @cs?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S might have made, but it might not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perfectly reasonable to take out insurance|pg||
nt|ritong: it s really late, i thought it was over  i certainly would not allow myself to crystalball a result that way:-)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  awesome, finally|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The bidding in  CR is for me one man show. If he want to be in 4@s, bid it directly|pg||
nt|iceking: w is dubion|pg||
nt|fifee: so 4@H is just settling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Greco had bid 2@D -- playing a Big Club -- Hampson wasn't going overboard|pg||
nt|noodle:  t|pg||
nt|chip: the reason to open 1d is to make it easier for partner to raise with support (partner won't be as happy to raise clubs with 4 since that is often 3)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: Jacobs 166   Markowicz 99             Mahaffey 127  Rosenthal 116        Diamond 180    Koneru 87     http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for more updates|pg||
nt|casenjo:  for another push!!!!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: push the push button|pg||
nt|casenjo:  9 in a row?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  We have one board left after this.|pg||
nt|bessi2: seems to me that 2s should have made|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry they are ahead of me :/|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  if Lauria does not balance against Greco/Hampson, I'm pretty convinced that pass must be best!|pg||
nt|3for3: me 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: i guess so|pg||
nt|reisig: right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: except for Michael Rosenberg who won't tell anyone [including Debbie] how he chooses opening with 4@C & 4@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: the thing we do not know -- did 3@S say anything about strength of Versace's hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fifee: lucky lie of the cards on this hand|pg||
nt|fifee: or do cards lay?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|chip: however, playing weak NT almost always right to open 1C, since 1D-1N is a bad auction (though there you can bid 2C with 4-4)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: People are starting to yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer +30 with 3 to play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  this is one of the reasons I love watching on BBO ... this hand will never be featured in a magazine, but still interesting to see how the stars bid (or don't) with the East hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bessi2: could have made more accurate perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry im getting pretty tired |pg||

nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|sybarra: and our great thx to Andy Hung,  the operator of our dreams @H |pg||
nt|brolucius: East quite rightly wanted to compete, but the choices were really a take-out double or perhaps 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last here thanks all |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But they did not play :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that is fast then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Next session will start at 7:30 central time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: HH are fast, Passell too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Obviously these guys switched around the responses, but they all work, as long as you agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like that better, shape is usually more important than size|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand thanks all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Much thanks to our hard working vugraph operator and organizer Jan Martel|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for final results|pg||
nt|ritong: so the last piece of a very active set|pg||
nt|bessi2: it happens :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: last here thanks all|pg||
nt|jlrice: i assume it didnt      but 5C in most situations i would assume to be just as good of a contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco-Hampson in 6@C   that's 2nd time we've seen that difference here|pg||
nt|jlrice: as 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes sorry, Versace also wrote the range was12-14|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: and to our many commentators  |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The next bid by opener asks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|casenjo:  Martin and Peter: It has been a pleasure!!!|pg||
nt|paulg:  Last hand for this set and just the one significant swing|pg||
nt|3for3: precision players sure open 1@D alot. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-15  could be 4441@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So in about an hour and 40 mins|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that's just a penalty double|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul seems uneasy about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  vs WeakNT  DBL=Pen|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - Gromov's pass was artificial, and Strul wanted to know what it meant|pg||
nt|iceking: Fredin Fallenius have had very strong set |pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks guys, it's been a pleasure =)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I mean responder|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Jo Anne|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Is this Flannery? I didn't know anyone still played it.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the top seeds were winning at last update in the wagar|pg||
nt|casenjo:  It looks like a Flannery hand 11-15 with 4 spades and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: ask Roland - the forbidden F-convention :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is and they are not alone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks everybody, a pleasure|pg||
nt|iceking: they havent played board 31 so i assume they are bidding that board|pg||
nt|3for3: I don't like bidding spades here with easts hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Versace, still curious, takes N's cards from the previous board to take a peek at what Lauria held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Congrats to Diamond and his team-mates!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Chip mentioned  Diamond has been doing very well recently|pg||
nt|chip: yes, they did a lot of good things this match (playing what is usually a very tough team).|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: mind you, I don;t know what he found out about it that prompted him to do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just been informed next session starts at 8|pg||
nt|po-s: dangerous hand - West was in 2S D for a short moment in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  easier to pass playing a strong club|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@d now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I can see Lauria is still active, concentrated on killing a fly that's flying around him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hampson joins the fight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i rooting for the fly|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Hope to see everyone tomorrow|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Finals of the Wagar Women's KO and Round of 8 of the Spingold will both be on BBO|pg||
nt|smoller: can you catch EW?|pg||
nt|ritong: we ll see just now|pg||
nt|pelu: can NS make 3NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't understand 2@S at these colours|pg||
nt|fifee: misdefense at the other table on 46, they won't get their 3 club tricks, it went spade, spade, allowing declaring to pitch a club loser|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only one of the original top four seeds remaining. Meltzer ( 3)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: 2NT on this auction is a rare bird|pg||
nt|po-s: yes |pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT looks like a picnic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They can, Peter, but 2@SX is better|pg||
nt|smoller: look vul!|pg||
nt|ritong: which is not the case of 2@s Xed|pg||
nt|3for3: right.  but diamond must be a tad uncomfortable, this could be a major law violation for his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Time for breakfast :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would not know what it meant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note:  rare is a 4-letter word|pg||
nt|dburn: if I were Becker I would be a confused man by the end of this auction - ostensibly, 2NT should be a strong distributional hand that does not want to pass 1NT doubled|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: and a special thx always goes to Jan Martel for organizing the operatorts.  and to ACBL for bringing this tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strul must have taken double as conventional|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise 2NT and 3@S make no sense|pg||
nt|dburn: but Strul hasn't got one of those, so I have no idea where this will all end, except that it will all end in tears|pg||
nt|cicus: I hide my face|pg||
nt|iceking: do we agree with Fredins dbl |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H-P-P-and another DBL ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  sporting double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfortunate end to a very good set for Becker-Strul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are not in complete agreement on which level to play at|pg||
nt|dburn: I really am not sure about all this - Becker may have concluded that Strul is two-suited (as I would) with spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The Encyclopedia of Bridge has another version. Evidently there have been several variations.|pg||
nt|chip: Auction started the same at the other table, but S pulled the double to 3D (presumably taking it not as penalty)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West was also in 2@S X - but S bid 3@d|pg||
nt|po-s: apparently it was discussed|pg||
nt|po-s: here|pg||
nt|ritong: who s the boss, eh?|pg||
nt|3for3: as it is, there are are 17 total trumps, so Larry Cohen is cringing somewhere|pg||
nt|paulg:  many thanks to Andy, our excellent operator for this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course to all the specs,  helpful , humorous comments |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more like 100, 10 or so i have used|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|jlrice: nope|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c or 2N?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco: |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: "Good match boys...hopefully no overtime"|pg||
nt|chip: what if declarer had Kx and was trying to sneak a D through and get an entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer  +29 with 2 to score|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the set and I'm sure we would all like to thank the splendid Asya, our special VG operator. Many thanks and well done!|pg||
nt|po-s: this looks enought|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From bad to worse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still avoiding the red card  [DBL]|pg||
nt|dburn: Strul appears to believe that Becker has some other hand than a penalty double of a weak no trump|pg||
nt|dima:  the biding is not over yet :)|pg||
nt|iceking: i think i would have just bid 2d here instead |pg||
nt|ritong: vulnerability rules a few too:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- my second guess was going to be 4@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|iceking: can dbl 2sp next turn |pg||
nt|jlrice: that would have been the bid I would have chosen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2nd DBL should deny 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok this is the last board of the 3rd segment|pg||
nt|chip: sorry, private reply|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|reisig: Easy 10 tricks...for the last board of the set|pg||
nt|ritong: i would shift @c jack|pg||
nt|ritong: but i m a simple soul|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks also to Roland and Danny, Linda and Henry for their comments|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is this bridge, I am asked. Well, this is extremely strange|pg||
nt|chip: Kib asks if DBL of 1N is penalty or T/o of hearts. the answer is yes, one or the other.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chip was willing to call Meltzer winner 2 boards ago -- so no more updates |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria puts dummy down and has left the room|pg||
nt|noodle:  A lot of BBOers happy when Fred makes it to the final of a national event  wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the italians use a lot of doubles to just say 'extra values'|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: He (Lauria) tried to take a glance on my screen to see the score and all three players says no don't, but Lauria says he will leave the room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Also, Jo Anne, my co-commentator. Thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Last hand here thanks everyone for watching|pg||
nt|po-s: A grand seems to be too high|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: Becker now hasn't got a clue what's happening, and should probably have stopped bidding|pg||
nt|po-s: why wait? It would get us to the 3level if we double 2S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dima:  oh well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most notable  Zaleski 99 vs Nickell 55|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is really just a misunderstanding - sad end to what has been a great effort by Strul personally; he has played some very good bridge these past two hours|pg||
nt|dima:  tough opening lead problem :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Director is being called now|pg||
nt|dburn: I thought he might be|pg||
nt|po-s: About 4 down unless he guesses wrong here and rhere|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Private messages are welcomed of course, but please don't blame ME for this disaster. I am innocent|pg||
nt|po-s: I don¬¥t think EW should complain|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Or me!|pg||
nt|dburn: because there must have been something in Dubinin's explanation of Gromov's pass to 1NT doubled that caused Strul to go off in this wild and woolly fashion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This does not even qualify as a Roland slam, so leave me out of it|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly Gromov's pass was alerted, but I do not know what explanation Strul had - Becker would have had the right one, but that would not help him much|pg||
nt|po-s: with a good hand or some escape start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you should probably consider the scores on bridgewinners  unofficial for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  and to all the kibitzers for their help|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores filtering in   http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South might not have seen the 1nt alreat?|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Dont know really|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes they are upest with the 1nt bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: worst ever was rubber bridge slam where defense scored added insult by collecting 100 honors|pg||
nt|po-s: Ah, they did reach seven after all|pg||
nt|dburn: well, whatever Strul leared from the director (or from the situation in general) has caused him to believe that if someone's going to go a lot off in something, it should be ...|pg||
nt|dburn: partner and not himself|pg||
nt|dima:  it is also the best combined fit|pg||
nt|bessi2: board 30 is missing, where cayne gained 3 imps|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzfe: I was just correcting the result to -5, instead of -4, and wanted to put the full auction in so it would be there|pg||
nt|iceking: and do you mind that Pio looking at south hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next live broadcast in 1 hour and 50 minutes from Norway|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: no overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe the 7-level is a bit high|pg||
nt|chip: Lauria probably expects the match to be rather close. They had one terrible result (7H down 1) but several good ones.|pg||
nt|chip: and even 7H down 1 could have been a push (if 6H went down)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok we are now down to the last board. I think this will be my last vugraph operating for this event so I hope I have done my best in providing a good show for those who have been ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: with me throughout the tournament!|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe:  http://bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|pelu: need to take @DA now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lauria @S spots make this a lock unless trump were 5-1|pg||
nt|chip: yes, one club entry, but might need several to take heart finesses. At any rate not an obvious hand. Also, after playing many hours for 8 days players are tired and need time to ...|pg||
nt|chip: work things out.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iceking: 3d is fine spot vs xxx jxx xxx xxxx or|pg||
nt|paulg:  Next set is scheduled to start in 30 minutes, but sometimes happens earlier|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: in less than half an hour is my estimate|pg||
nt|iceking: even vs 2 card diamond support you might make 3d so i dont get it why he gave up in 2sp|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: overtake pull trump & claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just claim :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The next segment will start in approximately 15-25mins from now, with the players needing to compare scores, get refreshed and come back whenever they're ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Fantunes table is just starting  46|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because same boards used in both matches   vugraph can't restart until all 4 tables in play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ...  a team can start playing final quarter earlier than noted in the schedule|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that "match" instead of "team"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: In case I didn't mention earlier, when the director came to the table to inform that board  36 result stands, Moss was determined to be appealing that board|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was hoping for some fireworks from North-South, who are a truly wonderful pair at their best. Unfortunately I cannot shake the memory of the ducked @CA from my mind. Reassuring ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: About 4 and a half hours|pg||
nt|po-s: Same four down|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: partners never have a major when you bid 3@c with a hand like Moss's, but you gotta keep trying|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|chip: may play 3D here. no, chose to bid game instead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss "I can pass 3@d"|pg||
nt|dburn: and if you go down in 3NT - well, maybe you'd have gone down in 2NT also|pg||
nt|chip: on this hand 3N better than 3D, but partner has an odd hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: here, as luck would have it, you wouldn't|pg||
nt|dburn: since partner has eight of his own winners and the defense can't cash enough|pg||
