nt|lml: its always a pleasure to watch Hamman and Zia|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: at the other table Passell continued with a low @d after the !k lead - perhaps he interpreted the @s5 as "I can tolerate a @d shift"?|pg||

mb|p|nt|caitlin: lucky spade break|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I missed Quantin's last pitch, but I think this has to be his hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: btw, some might ask "couldn't Zia bid 3@s there"|pg||
nt|joest: and in the old days yes but in these days that's a splinter|pg||
nt|joest: so you have to bid 2, then 3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|iceking: reaching 2sp with these cards is hard to understand |pg||
nt|ritong: it would be interesting to have other room auction, to see where the booboo is and avoid it ourselves|pg||
nt|iceking: 14hcp vs 12 and 6card suit |pg||
nt|iceking: been told south opened weak 2 spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: did S open 2@S in closed? Results do not show whether or not|pg||
pc|h6|nt|caitlin: yes he did thus no 4@S|pg||
nt|iceking: its the only logical reason really to end up in 2sp if south opened 2sp|pg||

nt|iceking: not much in play here declerar will end up with 11 tricks |pg||
nt|caitlin: anyone understand S opening 2@S?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|lml: this approach is better anyway because Hamman gets to show his hand too|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: yes and Zia has shown his sixth heart too so that Hamman can bid 4@h and know what he's doing|pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|joest: I just got drafted :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: actually I think you can make 4@S too|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman bids 4@h not 3NT b/c the spades can certainly come into play with hearts as trump.  Transportation and trick sources might be much dicier in 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: miscounted?|pg||
nt|caitlin: quacks yes but......|pg||
nt|iceking: sure he just downgraded his hand with so many losers |pg||
nt|hedyg: small @c lead impossible to find here i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: they might play 2sp sound even i think they used to do that before like 10-13 maybe silla forgot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were both super-max for their action; happens. The good news for the Strul team is that it is NV|pg||
nt|phil: Im scouring the net for a cc for NS at the other table - have found several for the individuals with differnet partners|pg||
nt|caitlin: e-cats|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You must go back to the BB in 2007, Phil|pg||
nt|phil: then here we go - assuming nothings changed: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Norway/saelensminde-brogeland.pdf|pg||

nt|joest: for the scores in all the matches go to http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/spingold/ |pg||
nt|lml: if hearts break as they do, obviously the hand is cold|pg||
nt|joest: we're not as good as the Europeans yet.  WE don't have 'up to the minute' scores|pg||
nt|lml: but if they dont you can probably still make it|pg||
nt|joest: on this one Zia acts with 4-4 inthe majors which some might hate but which works quite often|pg||
nt|joest: as it turns out it induces Hamman to take a phantomsave|pg||
nt|joest: I am surprised by Bompis pass here|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome Karen Allison everyone who will help Joe with the commentary|pg||
nt|joest: I can see not reaching for 5@c but the opponents are in an eight card fit at best.  I dont think they'll redouble and I doubt they will make five.   |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: yes, some players can bid 1NT in that situation as natural although a lot use it for other purposes|pg||
nt|joest: i don't see any way for Zia to come to a 7th trick here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: but you expect partner to have very little and it is dangerous to come in with a balanced hand with both opponents bidding|pg||
nt|lml: so a lot of players would not bid on the South hand.. shape is more important than high cards in the balancing chair|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|phil: some reading material since I was asked: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/obviousshiftprinciple.html|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Quantin asked something, but I'm not sure about what - perhaps the club 9 lead? I couldn't hear Rodwell's answer, but I think it was that whatever it was was ambiguous|pg||
nt|ritong: quantin s main preoccupation is to determine from where this @c 9 lead came|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: If the question was about the club 9, it is Rusinow - shows the 10 and nothing about higher honoros|pg||
nt|lestergold: if north is presumed to have the K@c why has south not played a higher card than the deuce 'thru' the J?|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: tht is not the French style however|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: I agree|pg||
nt|lml: I am fine with opening 1@C on this hand|pg||
nt|joest: it will be interesting to see where Zia and Hamman wind up on this hand|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT or 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|joest: interesting choice|pg||
nt|lml: and it dos get your best suit in|pg||
nt|joest: many wouldmake a responsive double|pg||
nt|joest: in fact I might be in that 'many'|pg||
nt|lml: the plus of 3 clubs assuming partner has at least 3 is similar to Zia s bid before|pg||
nt|lml: creats some pressure|pg||
nt|joest: guess what?  Meckwell bid 4@s on the last board|pg||
nt|kareno: Likely 3nt - wouldn't you think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: note Hamman responded 1@d not 1@h|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: surprise!|pg||
nt|joest: in many "Walsh" styles no one would even bid diamonds!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: 4@c here is a 'total trick' type of call trading on the almost certainty that partner has 5 clubs for his raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: with all his black cards I'm guessing Zia will opt for 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest: don't know if there are other checkback methods. If so this shows longer diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: well Hamman isn't bidding 3NT now!|pg||

nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: wrong again :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Why not?|pg||
nt|joest: well when my partner doesn't grab 3NT I might worry that there is a problem in one of the two black suits|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lml: not too surprised with that|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lml: doubling games is not that bad a plan|pg||
nt|joest: Pilon did very well here.  Pushed them up all by himself and then doubled them off|pg||
nt|lml: I think players dont do it enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 3NT would have fared better|pg||
nt|kareno: I really don't like Zia removing 3nt but who am I to judge.|pg||
nt|joest: well when Hamman bids this way he is (I think) showing a distributional red hand with longer diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: Zia liked his black suit controls...although 10xx of hearts is no great shakes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: diamonds now promotes a trump trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: the good news is that both heart honors are onside|pg||

nt|joest: Quantin on lead vs the same 3NT in the other room|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lml: very good bridge at this table so far, as we would expect|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|joest: tough call here.  I like to play one over one is forcing but I am in a tiny minority|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: hardly any alerts, none by French team|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: another partnership question: when north raises to 3@h here, is that forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: to me: no way|pg||
nt|lml: it really cant be since 2@H is forcing|pg||
nt|joest: no the raise to 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: what I meant was that 3@H cant be forcing since otherwise once South bids 2@H you are forced to game with a fit|pg||
nt|joest: quite a few seem to think that 'two over one' applies here|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure what the point is with the 1@d overcall.   Minimum values, bad suit, no preemptive value|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c here doesn't sound natural much as Bompis would wish it to be|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: although 4@c is quite a big bid with that hand! :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I sure don't play it forcing.|pg||
mb|2C|an|Q|nt|joest: maybe just a 3NT blast now.  Maybe a delicate 2@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lml: I think it is too much|pg||
nt|joest: it's interesting that Hamman is taking no action with five card club support for Zia|pg||
nt|joest: maybe he is afraid of pushing them too high|pg||
nt|lml: I have to say Pilon will do well to pass|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, 4@h was also reached on that last board but Rodwell did not double|pg||
nt|lml: its hard to think of a hand where partner bids 4@C and you dont have slam chances|pg||
nt|joest: well: how about this hand? :)|pg||
nt|lml: I guess it depends on what you think a splinter like 4@C should show|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Pilon long pause|pg||
nt|lml: if it is normally this weak then yes South should pass|pg||
nt|joest: I presume Pilon has seem north's splinters before|pg||
nt|lml: but I would be stronger|pg||
nt|joest: there is no safety in five either|pg||
nt|lml: yes five can go down for sure|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman can duck the spade lead and give his partner a ruff when Zia comes in with the trump ace|pg||
nt|kareno: North right about now sorry he overcalled :)|pg||
nt|joest: so they also misdefended 3NT on board 54 to push that one|pg||
nt|joest: however they avoided 5@d on the prior board and are poised to pick up a swing in 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: there was a hand bid by the French many years ago|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|joest: they were playing in a world final|pg||
nt|kareno: As we used to say, 'no double, no trouble.'|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt has some play.  Minimal, though.|pg||
nt|joest: the play in 3NT is complex.  Im betting that is where Meckstroth and Rodwell will wind up but we'll see|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Cayne over Deutsch 90-68|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The people at Bridge Winners are posting the scores as soon as they're up - all but 2 tables in this room are still playing|pg||

nt|joest: we will see that one in Challenge the Champs in a few years I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|joest: yes it is quite a bit easier looking at both hands|pg||
nt|lml: my double dummy bidding is particularly good|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: I can still make mistakes on play though|pg||
nt|joest: I might venture double here opposite an unpassed hand but vul opposite a passed hand I would probably chicken out|pg||
nt|joest: this is an impossible problem|pg||
nt|joest: if you bid 2@s then what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I guess I'll find out :)|pg||
nt|lml: well I would double|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|joest: Bompis might have entered with double there as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: folks I'm getting a ton of comments on the last hand.  Sorry I can't respond |pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: he will surely reopen now|pg||
mb|r|nt|joest: would you be happy about doubling now Linda? :)|pg||
nt|joest: this I don't believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I would be wondering how much 3@S doubled making is|pg||
nt|joest: 730|pg||
nt|joest: I wonder if Bompis has a sense of humor|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: he is obviously in your school and expects a robust doubl opposite|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|lml: phew ... not doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: at the other table Meck responded 1NT to the double: a reasonable compromise I think|pg||
nt|lml: this is probably as good a spot as any|pg||
nt|joest: no stoppers but shows values|pg||
nt|lml: at the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|joest: 4@d down here off the top|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: this could be done from here|pg||
nt|kareno: rehi|pg||
nt|joest: I think Hamman had to give Zia a ruff, then ace of spades and a spade to tap the dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: Got slammed off the net.|pg||
nt|joest: btw Meckwell did bid the grand|pg||
nt|joest: but on the hand that Zia bounced Hamman's preempt to 4@d, west passed and Meckwell got to 4@h|pg||
nt|kareno: That was expected I would say.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: but probably just one|pg||
nt|lml: hearts would have been worse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: Hamman is obviously a CHAMPION spot watcher|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: I'm guessing he'll hook the diamond and drive out the club ace|pg||
nt|lml: I think he is down one as long as he guesses things|pg||
nt|joest: this won't be so bad if his teammate makes 3@s at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but I don't think he can|pg||
nt|joest: so it's five imps to Nickell if Bompis guesses his way out for down one|pg||
nt|lml: well Pilon couldnt really pass the double the -730 was looming large|pg||
nt|joest: the risk/reward isn't too good|pg||

nt|joest: this hand counts out now|pg||
nt|joest: best is diamond to the ace ruff a spade then wait with your 10x of diamonds for one more trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: lose a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: I must say this match has been fun to watch but if there are any small children out there... don t pass forcing bids|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: before Support Doubles -- East had easy penalty double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|ritong: 3NT a brave bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Quantin asks about Rodwell's club play - upside down, generally attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dictionary describes bids as   brave -- bid worked   stupid -- bid backfired|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|mc|10|nt|ritong: well, i would not be scandalized by a cue|pg||

nt|lml: yes and actually north south have not played badly at all|pg||
nt|joest: Meckwell in 2NT on the hand where this north-south got to 5!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|joest: 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|joest: tough bid for Hamman.  Maybe just 2@h?|pg||
nt|joest: but no question that Nickell needs to find some dynamite in these last three hands tohave any shot at all|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest: feels like Zia will try 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: wonder what north is thinking about|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h will be a bit more of a test than 2@s would have been|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: and he will buy a great dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: Ace of diamonds buys Zia a nice present :)|pg||
nt|joest: three more boards yet to score besides these upcoming three|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|joest: i'm guessing a low spade now|pg||
nt|lml: I think a heart|pg||
nt|joest: it would appear that Bompis gave count there but I'm not that Pilon can be sure of that.  Why can't Bompis have a doubleton?|pg||
nt|joest: of course that would be a remarkable false card by Hamman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: fingering @D, put it back|pg||
nt|lml: probably not going to make that play|pg||
nt|lml: I mean Hamman|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe knowing hearts aren t breaking he just wants to put pressure on declarers trump holding with a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: fortunate club lie that will force north to ruff with natural trump tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it's only an overtrick.|pg||
nt|joest: it had an avoidance purpose|pg||
nt|joest: i'm working on it|pg||
nt|joest: with J10xx of hearts I would see it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: well you guessed spades and I guessed hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: we are 0 and 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: tis was most likely distro|pg||
nt|joest: given Hamman's passedhand status|pg||
nt|lml: apparently some specs guessed diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: so 0 and 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s5|nt|joest: this caters to a smalldoubleton with partner or Jx say so that when partner comes in with a trump trick you can give him a ruff|pg||
nt|joest: small club is a very thoughtful play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2nd result    Meltzer 143 over Lall 99    so  3 &  4 seeds move to round of 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: except if partner has help -- you've wrong sided because lead thru the @SQ|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, it would wrong side it when pard has Hxx|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|kit: difficult to avoid slam, except via RKC finding out off ace and queen of trumps|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|an|4|mb|p|nt|kit: After the double of 4@C, they might try 6NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman-zia knew that -- but bid the slam anyway      flip flop north-south trump and 6@S makes|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course terrible slam because needs 22 AND Ace onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but 6NT doesn't quite fetch|pg||

nt|joest: Hamman will open 1@S|pg||
mb|2H!|an|Tx|nt|joest: I'm shocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Winner of this match faces the winner of Jacobs vs. Henner-Welland|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: even after getting talked into playing five card majors by Zia, 1@s is the bid Bob has made his whole life :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: jacobs up by 29 entering the fourth quarter|pg||
mb|3C!|an|!D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|joest: at the other table Rodwell opened 1@h and Meckstroth responded 1@s.  so much for getting to 2@s east-west|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c = transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s confirms a third (or fourth) spade|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|joest: on a lucky day this would make|pg||
nt|joest: today we see if being off one + the queen dissuades Hamman|pg||
mb|5C|an|1-4|mb|p|mb|5D|an|Q ask|mb|p!|mb|5H|an|no !SQ|mb|p|nt|joest: interesting.  they play step one (instead of returning to the trump suit) as denying the queen|pg||
nt|joest: that was the way it was written up way back when|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: makes you wonder why Bob asked :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|joest: this will be over quickly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: this is still not so clear|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: no|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure Bob thinks he needs this swing (and it looks like he's right).|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: well he unvlocked spades|pg||
nt|joest: but n-s can't get more than five. they're only in two|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough Karen|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|mc|11|nt|joest: and he is right about needing the swing|pg||
pg||
qx|o64|st||md|2S97H852D842CKJT92,S84HKJT643DAQ53C8,SAQJT32HAQ9DK76C5,SK65H7DJT9CAQ7643|sv|e|nt|bigtrain: 6@S seems like state of the match to me...  H&Z had to bid it and Q&M bid it defensively (because they suspected it would be bid in the CR)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one board left to score  DeKnijff over Fleisher by 32|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|bigtrain: it's understandable...  just looks wrong|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|kit: so if you think your counterparts will bid it defensively, then the swing action is to correctly stay out of the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you think many north americans would find Multon's RDBL?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: maybe...  but who knows...  i didn't agree with it just said it's understandable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|kit: I wouldn't redouble|pg||

mb|2H|nt|joest: so Zaleski has demonstrated that basic steady bridge will win you lots of matches.  They bid their games; they bid their slams; theydoubled when their opponents were going down|pg||
nt|joest: they took their tricks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks to Jack and the operator who has done a terrific job.|pg||
nt|kareno: Most matches are lost, rather than won.|pg||
mb|3C|an|no leb|nt|joest: looks like north-south do not play Lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and thanks to the ACBL and BBO who has brought us this great bridge to watch|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: yes thx operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes there is another segment coming up|pg||
nt|joest: and thx kibitzers too|pg||
nt|joest: so 3@c is strength-ambiguous|pg||
nt|joest: this is the last hand of the match.|pg||
nt|joest: Many thanks to John Schwartz, our talented operator|pg||
nt|joest: thanks John|pg||
nt|kareno: <applause>|pg||
nt|joest: and to Karen Allison, my co-commentator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thx all, see you tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: interesting choice between 1NT and 2@d there|pg||
nt|kareno: And to you, Jack :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: yes lots of comments and interesting ideas from all the kibbitzers|pg||
nt|joest: Meckwell of course bid their heads off in the open room and competed to 3@d|pg||
nt|lml: yes there are more boards coming after a break|pg||
nt|joest: so north-south hit the brakes in 3@s which, as luck would have it, is still too high|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: this looks headed for down one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Zia leaves every time he is dummy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: so north south have six tricks off the top|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond looks routine here.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: (or not :)  )|pg||
nt|joest: bompis understandably suspicious of this 'gift'|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: so Meckstroth will need tomake 3@d which looks a stretch|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|lml: but east-west doesnt have enough tricks without giving up a black trick|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: so it will be a 25+ imp lead for Zaleski headed for the final 16 boards|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: my guess is that the next quarter will start in about 15 minutes but I would defer to the operator|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: it will be interesting to see if Zaleski can hang in|pg||
nt|lml: really I think everybody has played pretty well|pg||
nt|joest: last quarter coming up in a just a few minutes|pg||
nt|joest: Hamman has to weaken hishand in some way here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: plays for hearts 33|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: other option was to cross to the dummy and hook the club ten|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: there is a squeeze now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|nt|lml: if South wins the club|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: was|pg||
nt|lml: now its just going down|pg||
nt|joest: down one|pg||
nt|kareno: So down one.|pg||
nt|joest: thanks again everybody|pg||
nt|joest: play resumes tomorrow in about 12+ hours|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: dummy had to hold three spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Goodnight all.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime the other room has about four boards to go|pg||
nt|joest: good night everybody and thanks again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: night all, other table still playing|pg||
