mb|3N|nt|mrdct: interesting choice for north here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: the lure of the vul game at imps is quite powerful even with partner a passed hand|pg||
nt|po-s: 2NT may well be natural in France|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess he has options of passing for penalty or bidding 2NT lebensohl|pg||
nt|po-s: this can be made but needs some delicate handling|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni did well to not lead a @s|pg||
nt|po-s: duck a club and play up to the kings in S and D|pg||
nt|po-s: good choice not to pass the double|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course 2@s is fantunes 10-13 with 5@s - not a weak 2 or a weak 5-5|pg||
nt|mrdct: if he pulls a @s to J (which is kind of indcated on the auction) he might go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|po-s: a standard Multi byBompis (East) in the other room....|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|mrdct: nice play in @h here to generate the extra entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: i come back to how easy this hand would've been for delcarer on the quite reasonable lead of the @SQ to a fair chunk of this swing to be credited to fantoni|pg||
nt|mrdct: although we probably shouldn't write declarer of just yet|pg||
nt|po-s: I think we should|pg||
nt|mrdct: he could still score 3@c, @SK, @HQ9 and @DK for 9 tricks - but defence favourites to get their 5 tricks 1st|pg||
nt|po-s: spade back gives def 3 spades a diamond and a club|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
nt|po-s: club back might do it - if ducked and continued|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think a @h by fantoni looks safest from east's perspective|pg||
nt|po-s: DQ is good enough since declarer needs an extra club East gets in again|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be struggling to work out where west's 10-13hcp are|pg||
nt|po-s: a heart, a club duck must be followed by a spade I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni has been in the tank for at least 3 minutes now|pg||
nt|po-s: a refusal to  play may be scored as a make|pg||
nt|mrdct: based on the hard boiled egg that i just prepared since he won the @SQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: operator - is fantoni still breathing?|pg||
nt|po-s: Multon is a very fast player|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: multon in wincing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fantoni has his elbows on the table and is deep in thought|pg||
nt|po-s: he might have forgotten what cards have been played by now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i really struggle against super-slow defenders as it is so hard to maintain concentration when you have finished thinking about all the things you want to think about and then a 5 ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: minute delay occurs and I forget everything|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is getting quite ridiculous now|pg||

nt|ritong: basically, french style is 15/17 NT  here pilon "tacticalled" a bit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: Jo Anne:)|pg||
nt|ritong: due to positioàn, vulnerability and a not-so-bad hand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think upgrade w West hand is a popular thing|pg||
nt|peachy: the club suit is lovely|pg||
nt|ritong: bompis has a tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: worth the same as AJxx|pg||
nt|ritong: all he knows is his pard had not enough to call 3@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I like those 10's and 9's, they certainly help NT hands|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Pretty big boost with Sontag's distribution|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: diamond lead is likely, to set it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: o should have said "obvious" not likely|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|casenjo:  Sometimes it is better to have a method where the 'big hand' is not on  lead, and the other hand needs to guess what to lead.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: not certain they made a reasonable decision, since 5@c is likely one off versus one off in 4@h, but if this goes down as it should, at least at first glance, result will be OK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|casenjo:  Other times, you like to begin by endplaying the big hand at trick 1, when he has to 'lead away' from honors|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a nice hand in evidence for those who oppose transfer overcalls|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Obviously, nothing 100% in these situations|pg||

nt|ritong: they certainly have tools for minors after 1NT|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|2D!|an|1 Major or a 2-suiter|nt|ritong: and south has a good hand for minors|pg||
nt|mrdct: it be awkward to deal with the non-anchored intervention over 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: *can be|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway, other room reached ideal contract|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|po-s: some players might not consider West´s hand a two-suiter|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d here may turn out to be a lot more effective than the 3@s overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes - i think he would be treating that as a single-suiter in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: for that matter, if it happens that you have a choice with two nine cards fits, prefer the one WITHOUT the ace if possible to determine it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the advantage of the 2@D bid is that it denies NS the chance to have a normal lebensohl sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: the reason is quite simple, and this layout goes in that sense|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mrdct: it wont be that easy for NS to diagnose which minor fit is best in this competitive auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the pesky little 3@c bid by fantoni also worked well|pg||

mb|1N!|an|14-17|nt|casenjo:  This makes it interesting  to see how different experts handle situations|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: probably due to the fact that there is more space in the playing rooms:) then the risks of a noisy burstout, giving info to an other table, are lower|pg||

nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|joest: i just got pressed into service :)|pg||
nt|joest: and hopefully maybe somebody else will join so you won't have to just listen to me!|pg||
nt|joest: Berkowitz might have made a negative double but he is giving full credit to his vul vs not opponent|pg||
nt|joest: plus 4@s sounds more like 'minors' which is a big plus|pg||
nt|joest: and 'minors' is exactly what partner has|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joe and Constantin|pg||

nt|joest: in fact Sontag's hand is mighty good except for the spde king|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Berkowitz confused|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it seems like different explanation of the auction on both sides of table|pg||
nt|joest: he did well not to choose a minor himself or he might have gotten a diamond lead|pg||
nt|joest: here it is very hard for east-west to engineer their ruff|pg||
nt|joest: unless Bompis reads it all, leads and leads a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: and believe me leading a @d here would be one great lead in my book|pg||
nt|joest: oh yeah!|pg||
nt|joest: doesn't matter since West has a stiff trump|pg||
nt|joest: too much multitasking|pg||
nt|joest: very well done by Berkowitz and Sontag|pg||
nt|joest: 6@d does go down on ace and a club ruff|pg||
nt|joest: so they've not only bid slam|pg||
nt|joest: they bid the right one|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mrdct: a good start for the defence having the singleton on lead|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|ritong: south should apply the shortness theorem|pg||
nt|ritong: "pard invites, you have a hand you are not ashamed of and a shortness, just accept"|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT???|pg||
nt|mrdct: even on the non-@d lead 3NT only has 8 tricks|pg||

mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|p|nt|peachy: W might have sacrificed taken his ace of spades, dont know for sure if that would have yileded one more trick to defense in the end|pg||
nt|tempid: Certainly shortened the play of the hand by taking the @d finesse early.|pg||
nt|joest: looks like Berk will kick off a nebulous @d|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Possibly, it went down 2 in the Cayne room|pg||
nt|ritong: sontag had an alternate choice with 2@d|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: showing two other suits 5+5+|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see what the checkback methods are|pg||
nt|joest: but west is on lead looking at trump control and a stiff|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Art GF|nt|peachy: usually when defense plays spades, trust partner and continue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but he elected to hide a bit|pg||
mb|3C|an|3!S-5!C|mb|p|nt|peachy: I mean trumps :)|pg||
nt|ritong: a good idea here, when defense has few clues about his hand|pg||

nt|noodle:  against that he had 3 aces facing a jumpshifting (albeit limited) pard  and the J@h is kinda +++|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h doubled is the contract on board 44 in the other room too|pg||
mc|12|nt|joest: well this is really the first opportunity Zaleski has had.  In about 45 minutes we'll know if they take advantage of it! :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might be surprised that is a push on 44|pg||

nt|mrdct: might play this in the moysian @s fit - but trumps are 3-3 so will be OK|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 5@d works too|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS in some danger now - but even 5@d makes here with the @DJ coming down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: even 5@d will make barring a club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nevermind that|pg||
nt|pelu: 2x@H and no time to set up the 11. tricks in @s|pg||

mb|d|nt|joest: this gives Berk the chance to volunteer 3@c|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: will Sontag show @D now?|pg||
