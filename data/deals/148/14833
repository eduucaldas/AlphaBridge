nt|joest: now here is a weak to|pg||
nt|joest: 21|pg||
nt|joest: 2|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|joest: althoughfor some pairs this is way too good (again) at these colors|pg||
nt|andyv:  funny... this one doesn't make 4:)|pg||
nt|joest: this is worth a boost just to try to keep them out|pg||
nt|joest: funny... the other hand doesn't have two aces, a side four card suit and a stiff :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: n thinking|pg||
nt|joest: right. he is thinking 'how high do I fly?|pg||
nt|joest: he might bid 4 but that is abit much with 3433 |pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|nt|joest: but at these colors you can kinda do what you want assuming partner is not a maniac|pg||
nt|andyv:  he doesn't want to drive them to 4@s... so he'll bid 2N and sign off.|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT is an operation of sorts.  It lets them in easily|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards sit well for EW|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure what (if any) agreements they have here.    Lacking any I would volunteer 3@h b/c that's what I have|pg||
nt|andyv:  novel concept, Jack:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south alerts 2N, removes glasses, counts on fingers|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|andyv:  Ogust?|pg||
nt|joest: if he needs to count on his fingers his step responses go higher than mine do!|pg||
nt|andyv:  good suit bad hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder what the purpose of dbling 3@d was|pg||
nt|joest: if Alan bids 4@h that might wipe east-west out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: good suit confirmed|pg||
nt|andyv:  showing a spot to play?|pg||
nt|joest: if he passes, east might venture 3@s and catch a raise to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: Dunitz afraid (understandably) that doubling and then bidding 3@s might show something more than what he has|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  already pretty brave to stick his neck out|pg||
nt|joest: but when this hand is over Schafer and Dunitz will be a little queasy that they have now missed two games in the first three boards|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  18 has proven to be a one imp gain for Onstott|pg||
nt|joest: they did not bid game on 18|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|joest: knowing Walter, he might put his bidding shoes on :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  I think bidding game on this hand is also difficult|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: but when you are leading, you have to be concerned that the trailing team won't stop and worry too much about what makes before bidding it|pg||
nt|joest: sorry Walter = Walter Schafer|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 13 imps can be wiped out in a hurry|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, north just raised 2@h to 4 and ended all shot of east-west finding their game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: so everything will be pretty much as it is after the first three boards|pg||

mb|2H|nt|joest: 2@h here has some good things about it|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  and there you are|pg||
nt|joest: 5@c now|pg||
nt|joest: I just don't think you can afford to pass even if both contracts are down|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may make a neg. resp. dbl and N bid 5@c|pg||
nt|joest: that feels like the only time you are paying off|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|joest: so bidding feels like cheap insurance|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: at the worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not to mention it avoids the dreaded two way game swing|pg||

nt|joest: have a sip of your favorite alcoholic beverage and pretend this is a 1 imp match|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at the replay, it had to have been a bad claim|pg||
nt|deltadash: my thoughts exactly :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|joest: well last set there were two misclaims|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|joest: this is an interesting 'standard' sequence|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: some play that 1@s here is four or more and 2@s is artifical fourth suit forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  true but don't remember one being this costly|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|joest: obviusly the Sieberts are in that camp|pg||
nt|deltadash: yup|pg||
nt|andyv:  and if you play xyz you have even more chances to go wrong:)|pg||
nt|joest: So Dave mulling over the merits of 3@s (very descriptive) vs 2NT|pg||
nt|joest: yes in XYZ, 2@C would transfer to 2@d and 2@d would be an artificial game force|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest: I have no idea what 2@s would mean were I playing XYZ|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael Savage and I have a running discussion on that one|pg||
nt|joest: so Alan will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: I would guess 5-6 |pg||
nt|joest: but I am old fashioned.  what do I know?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  are there enough tricks here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  not an easy lead for E....esp. with two of them being tempting|pg||
nt|deltadash: I can't count to 9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: i think they come up short unless Mitch starts a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead seems to be most effective|pg||
nt|joest: yes the 2@s artificial GF followed by the 3NT retreat sounds like big diamonds at your right if you are Dunitz|pg||
nt|joest: I'm guessing Alan will duck two spades,win the third and pass the 8 of diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can win 2nd @s and fire back a @d also (won't happen) but that is how desperate N's situation is|pg||

nt|andyv:  even if @hs work, you are still short a trick|pg||
nt|joest: even if west had Qxx that was only eight tricks (1 spade + 4 hearts + 1 diamond + 2 clubs)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|deltadash: but Allan knows what he's doing - obviously I don't|pg||

pc|h8|nt|andyv:  unless defense falls asleep, this should go down 1|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: don't know the range but even if 20-21 this is a perfectly good upgrade b/c of the strong five card suit|pg||
nt|joest: this is always pretty much a guess what to do with north's cards|pg||
nt|joest: although bidding 3NT is taking a very deep position on the club suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: not vulnerable maybe you can get away with it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|joest: schafer hopes to hit paydirt with a 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|joest: but fails|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now I guess you close your eyes and bid 3NT and hope|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|fabsayc: 3@H seems routine here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Davis in thought|pg||
nt|peachy: E might bid 3NT, 3H just pinpoints the club problem|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps best to be careful, not vul|pg||
nt|peachy: so missed gme is not the end of the world|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: contract is 4H doubled by south|pg||
nt|joest: 5@c is close to making.  3NT doesn't have a prayer|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 3H allows for all contracts, but apparently for them has extra meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Right, seems that way|pg||
nt|joest: saying 5@c is close to making is an overstatement|pg||
nt|joest: it's closer than 3Nt|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: luckily for Onstott west doesn't have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|joest: in the open room they have just started playing the east-west 6@c hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not sure the east-west carding|pg||
nt|joest: i.e. whether they play 3rd and 5th vs NT|pg||
nt|joest: or whether the 7 is just an odd lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: standard|pg||
nt|joest: ok an odd lead :)|pg||
nt|joest: from Dunitz perspective it can't be fourth best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th best|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|joest: b/c that would give Koshy QJ9x where he would have led the Q|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: this is a good shot at stealing a club trick b4 the defenders know what is going on|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: if south started with Axx for example, Onstott needs to duck this!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: Onstott is worried about that and ducked|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i like this lead|pg||
nt|joest: this gives declarer the entry for thte diamond hook|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: South could easily have spade king from wests point of view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Koshy thinking |pg||
nt|joest: in the open room north-south took out insurance and saved over 6@c|pg||
nt|joest: so Onstott will shortly put some imps in its column|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|joest: Schafer opens 1NT no matter what his range|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: see what I mean? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he does have the 10@c and the distribution for it.|pg||
nt|joest: I am surprised at north's pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Miscounting is part of the game|pg||
nt|joest: even at these colors I think you have to act with 6-5|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be effective|pg||
mb|2C!|an|many possi bilities (Meckwell?)|nt|Walddk2: South should definitely come in|pg||
nt|joest: diane do you know what 2@c is?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know it's a misfit but the players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|deltadash: don't have a clue|pg||
nt|joest: or even better if the operator sees the explanation|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Diane.  You're fired!|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: lol, thx Jack!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  or mod. hamilton (relay to 2@d and then S shows his hand)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: No pay rise for you, no|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  N doesn't accept the relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh my|pg||
nt|joest: now there is a strong inference here that Dunitz is on a four card suit b/c he did not transfer over 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: The tray actually got passed from SW to NE without a pass card from Schafer, but everyone is assuming he passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: now what Schafer is supposed to do with that inference is another question altogether|pg||
nt|andyv:  you can't ever assume that with Walt|pg||
nt|deltadash: it USED to be Hamilton but don't have a clue now|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only question is why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have liked to see 2@S played as South .... with a double!|pg||
nt|joest: I can think of better spots that 2@s on this layout|pg||
nt|joest: but if Dunitz gets out for down one he holds serve|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I can see that Alan wrote 4 possibilities on the sheet of paper, but I can't read them, so am guessing it's Meckwell (one was Mm)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  he can certaily scramble for 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's try a low club|pg||
nt|joest: doesn't Meckwell 2@c show clubs and another?|pg||
nt|joest: it's something but it's not Meckwell|pg||
nt|andyv:  if mod. hamilton, 2@c is relay to 2@d and S then would show either @ds or a major/minor hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I don't know - I thought it had lots of possibilities -  - Alan is now explaining - can be Major-minor or both minors|pg||
pc|dT|nt|joest: I'm told 2@c relayed to 2@d and showed diamonds or major/minor.  He had both!|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|joest: on to the play in 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Or maybe one-suited diamonds |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: If it's 2 suits, it's 5-5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||

mb|2H|nt|joest: then they dropped another trick in the claim process :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: that's what I have to put in the record|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h is weak and perhaps very misjudged here as it will cause east-west to lose their spade fit and spade game!|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Koshy is strong enough that he might move but his partner could have 'hearts and out'|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|joest: drinks are on me if they find 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|joest: the 5-1 diamond split just makes matters worse|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Koshy is unhappy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|joest: as well he might be|pg||
nt|joest: although if you are going to bid there is something to be said for bidding 2@s. You wouldn't move without distribution so bidding 2@s shows long diamonds at the same time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: In the Bridge World's "You Be the Judge" I would probably apportion it about 20%west and 80% east|pg||
nt|joest: others might well disagree with me though|pg||
nt|joest: so a big 15 pickup on board 9: double slam in one room, save in the other|pg||
nt|joest: Onstott will give some back on board 10 with their 800 payout in 4@sX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: system froze|pg||

nt|joest: Im guessing but maybe 3@d means "I have a singleton somewhere"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C is ok as past hand, otherwise slight overbid|pg||
nt|joest: many top pairs like the old fashioned natural forcing 2NT response|pg||
nt|joest: and 3@h asks where|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: and when you play that it means that your 2/1 responses are always 5+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: trump led will sink 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: probably misguess diamonds as well|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, double of 3@C was rosenkranz, showing top honour|pg||
nt|joest: on the east-west accident where they played 3@d with their 4-4 spade game, east west have arrived in 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|joest: so Meyers will be extending its lead in a couple of minutes|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure whether Schafer knows that Dunitz has extras or not|pg||
nt|joest: Some "Jacoby 2NT" systems show that|pg||
nt|joest: In this month's ACBL bulletin is a 'new improved' Jacoby 2NT written up by Larry Cohen which everyone should check out|pg||
nt|joest: anyway this is an icecold grand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|joest: pointed out to me that on spades 4-1 you need to guess the jack of spades and that is definitely true|pg||
nt|joest: I jumped the gun|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|peachy: making:)|pg||
nt|joest: it looks like 6@s was a grand slam try of some sort|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what 6NT means|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|joest: so the lead is up to 23 now because of that spade game|pg||
nt|joest: now in 4@s on that hand where Dunitz went down two|pg||

mb|1C|nt|joest: thanks to Andy Vinock and Diane Siebert the other commentator|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|joest: Koshy did indeed open Schafer's hand with 2@c at the other table|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  different paths, same destination|pg||
nt|joest: the !10 seems normal|pg||
nt|joest: but declarer has 11 tricks with the heart falling and with a normal club guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: And a big thank you to Jeff Johnston at ACBL, who's been very supportive of increasing Vugraph coverage the last couple of years - we'll be covering the Spingold starting on ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Tuesday (I expect that will be the Round of 64, but the numbers are so confusing I'm not sure - the "odds makers" are predicting about 80 teams to start on Monday|pg||
nt|andyv:  good number|pg||
nt|deltadash: who's making book on the winner?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Schafer: "remember the time I opened 1NT with14? I have extra this time to make up for the one I shorted you that time"|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|joest: on board 14, north did not find the miraculous reopening double of 2@s so Onstott will pick up a few more|pg||
