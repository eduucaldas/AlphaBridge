nt|Walddk2: Wait a minute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They call it Monrad Pairs|pg||
nt|andersk: Du får hilse til Peter og Rune, TorO:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That allows replays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: otherwise it's Swiss|pg||
nt|andersk: sry was supposed to be private|pg||
nt|haans: may all meet opps twice?|pg||
nt|henryb:  We ran this once with replays allowed, just not in successive rounds|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has an awkward hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I am uncertain. In strict Monrad (Danish) you can, in Swiss you can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: small delay |pg||
nt|haans: otherwise may be problem at last pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe TorO can shed some light|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am just curious, since the US runs very few Swiss Pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told cannot, in that case they should not name the tournament Monrad as they do on the front page. Swiss rather as written on the vugraph banner|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: and that 2@H is contructive|pg||
