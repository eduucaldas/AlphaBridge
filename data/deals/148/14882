nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This should be fun for me, I have played with Mike Passell and Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome everyone |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am currently writing a book with Boye Brogeland, so I hope for some great hand in this set that we can use in the book.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They are both marvelous players, that make you feel like you are relaxing in a rocking chair|pg||
nt|po-s: strange! Duboin-Sementa not playing. Probably one of them must be ill.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Sergey, David and Al|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not if you are playing against them!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to New orleans|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all welcome|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Another close match tonight|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Hey guys, welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Cayne and Seamon to the best of my knowledge play 2/1 with fairly sound openng bids; Diamond-Platnick I believe play a highly scientific strong club system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1st 6 boards had already been compared with blistering score of 3-0 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll play 10 boards from this new set of boards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: welcome also to Frank Budai, Australia   (rejoining us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh they changed names,  skip previous comment |pg||
nt|casenjo:  transfer to clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs and South will have two possible responses: 2NT and 3@C. 2NT would indicate a good fit for clubs.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards so if you want to compare in realtime use   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|c9|nt|casenjo:  Yes, 'in between pre accepts'|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|casenjo:  NS comes out shooting, bidding a game on a finesse, but alas the king is offside|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin should make this, he does not need to guess @ds when @cs split that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the club players I was talking about are in the other room  but we have a great room!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks, to leave West with an awkward comtinuation.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And Boye has his work cut out for him on hand  1|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hello, henry!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two finesses actually|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hi all they have started before i was able to set up|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: and let's send good thoughts to Antonio Sementa for speedy recovery|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: but he has a trump control problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @H from Jeff or a spade? |pg||
nt|ritong: so, if aker plays a @h back, south might consider pitching a @c|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: East's @S3 was a discouraging signal, warning West not to continue spades (into the lion's jaw - South's A-J).|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well done to reach the reasonably cold 3N: cold as the cards lie in anycase|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|nt|henryb:  of all the continuations that was probably the worst|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: re-morning Frank |pg||
nt|ritong: salut frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi Frank, welcome back :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|casenjo:  yes, Mike has made it easy for Boye|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi jo, spectators|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin disagrees with my plan, so odds are i missed something:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: will pray for it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Gábor Szõts|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And to Michael Barel|pg||
nt|mich-b: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And good evening to Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|cicus: the good lead will earn an IMP for DEKnijff|pg||

nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome to our Canadien expert!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Welcome back to the 4th quarter of the Spingold Round of 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome they already started board 17|pg||
nt|casenjo:  30 Imps is not insurmountable; however, Fredin-Fallenius are playing magnificent bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hi all exciting first board!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||

nt|fabsayc: Canadian, I am not french :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 7 passes in a row so far |pg||
mb|1N|nt|casenjo:  oops! So Sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
nt|mich-b: EW in the closed room bid to a not so elegant 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  I was originally from Detroit, so close to Windsor that I was semi-Canadian, and do understand the difference|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Bjorn has something to think about here. It sounds to him like a pinocle deck|pg||
nt|cicus: best here to play some number of @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to reach the cold 4@c after a 1N opening|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mich-b: I think West here can rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|iceking: both times Sementa had 4-5 in majors though:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Andy is just catching up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: We are up to Board 21 so I am just inputting the bidding and score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes - that's quite a replacement pair|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
nt|cicus: tough though for West to give @D preference with 6 spades|pg||
nt|mich-b: giving preference to opener's 1st suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  for majors |pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: vuls wrong to act|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and the expert is correct, Bjorn new the vulnerability was wrong here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  knew, not new|pg||
nt|fabsayc: besides raising would have just helped opponents who actually have missed an excellent slam|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sorry, folks, had a couple drinks at dinner, please excuse my typing|pg||
nt|casenjo:  For a change we have a straight forward auction, negative double, cue bid asking partner how good his overcall is....|pg||
nt|cicus: N comes to the rescue|pg||
nt|cicus: X?|pg||
nt|dinos1: lucky 4@s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: they play extended takeout X's so I would not be surprised to see one|pg||
nt|iceking: would 2nt be more natural with Fredins hand |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Accident of position gets E-W off to the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish you hadn't just announced symptoms -- i know enough to be very worried about those|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Are scores known? Seems empty even on Bridgewinners|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: with nobody wanting to quit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Glad to have you back!!!|pg||
nt|mich-b: Versace knew they had a @D fit , so was not tempted to rebid @Ss|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||
nt|cicus: not this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe:  http://bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @S look probable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a rare 3 or 7 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks, you too|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Martin Johnson and Jo Anne Casen are your commentators this evening|pg||
nt|cicus: this will make in comfort|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much harder to beat this if North plays it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Moss bought the hand in 4@S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Our jobs are to keep you entertained and not make complete fools out of ourselves :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all at the same time?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-1 spade break makes this a bit complicated|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fleisher - Kamil have been replaced by Chip Martel and Lew Stansby; one of the longest running partnerships in North America and inventors of the "Rule of 20"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: but at this point, perhaps...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brogeland and Saelensminde won the recent 3-day Lifemaster Pairs, here in New Orleans.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s5|pc|c7|nt|casenjo:  Fallenius has been living in New York, but according to Roland Wald, he will now be playing for Sweden again. Nice news for the Swedes. He is a marvelous player.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi David |pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: The good news for Aker is that he won't go 4 down|pg||
nt|iceking: Fredins only change is low diamond now|pg||
nt|iceking: chance even|pg||
nt|ady: can get and end play to save a diamond trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  This is the sort of hand that makes one appreciate the difficulty of playing with less experienced partners|pg||
nt|dima:  He surely ruffed middle|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|po-s: appreciate Henry?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fredin has found a winning line|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: conceeding a ruff  but making hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: he might|pg||

nt|henryb:  still, N-S did better than par which is -130 in 4@c|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opening lead places those high cards with south, and north bid vulnerable. Kamil's problem is: did North bid on strength or length?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have given a suit-preference signal on the first round of hearts, attempting to show the @SK to her partner.|pg||
nt|henryb:  appreciate in the sense of gaining understanding, not in the sense of getting warm feelings|pg||
nt|po-s: This is a European fight in a way; Norway against Poland/Russia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sigurbjörn and Magnús formed a very successful partnership at the EC in Belgium recently and qualified for the Bermuda Bowl next year. Well done guys!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: the other match ended later than this match, so vugraph couldn't restart until all 4 tables back in play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: if there ever was a horse beaten to death, it would probably be computer deals|pg||
nt|brolucius: I believe that only 3 or 4 of the top 20 seeds have an all-American squad.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The best bridge book I ever read is Mike Lawrence's "How to Read Your Opponents' Cards"|pg||
nt|iceking: 2sp will not work here |pg||

mb|1N|nt|po-s: All enlightenment is appreciated, Hensry|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, helness didn't balance over 2@H but Gromov did over 3.|pg||
nt|mich-b: of course Versace will not overcall - he needs a much better suit for that|pg||
nt|iceking: in more normal methods bidding might go 1sp-1nt-2d-2h-4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S now?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: some how do not see a double coming at this table |pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not an advert for bad suit weak two bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: play 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: With 6-4 in @S and @H it is better to rebid 2@H and not 2@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: lol yes i have east west convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: A little lost thats all|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: looked on the wrong side|pg||
nt|phil: 1@c - 1@d would show hearts if you are curious|pg||
nt|phil: 1@c - 1@s is usually diamonds, or some minor oriented hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=forced|pg||
nt|ady: spades play well  for n/s|pg||
nt|dinos1: as spades play well in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne decision partially affected by whether or not 1N rebid could have singleton @S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: but it is so human to blame a machine rather than your own skills|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure why the final contract was doubled at the other table - sure, South opened the bidding, but even so...|pg||
nt|mich-b: as Fallenius did|pg||
nt|mich-b: Sometimes partner (who responded 1NT) has a @H fit and game can be reached|pg||
nt|mich-b: while he would be passing 2@S|pg||
nt|mich-b: with both major suit kings offside , this will go down|pg||
nt|cicus: seems that E will have to return @DK then at winning with @CK|pg||
nt|cicus: lest the small @D goes on @Cs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! the only killing is @dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and whether Seamon can raise 1@S-2@S with only 3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would also be unwise as the defence can't come to more than 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|sybarra: are the results of round 3 posted?  so we know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 hearts with only 6 is tricky|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like this should be down 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: *do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that actually happened to me in a regional in seattle, we were set up in the hall|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: don´t understand @cJ|pg||
nt|cicus: on a @H S can win and finesse in @Cs|pg||

nt|cicus: unless we are in for an undo|pg||

nt|dinos1: yes, he can|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss rebid 2@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on Round of 32 to the left|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|casenjo:  The lead opens to 20, when the diamond slam was bid in the other room on Board 34|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes and after south raised spades :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They usually cover the mirrors in the hotel playing areas, I once played where they forgot to cover the mirrors on the ceilings.  They were on strange angles and everyone could see all of the hands.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i shift to spade 9|pg||
nt|mich-b: declarer could hope to get 1 discard on @C and 2 on the @Ds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  best line looks to be to ruff a diamond and lead a small club to the 10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Brogeland likes an 8-11 point weak-two opening. Weaker hands are shown with a multi 2@D.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|dburn: maybe Maksymets was anxious that his partner should lead a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Fredin perfect again!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin on fire, has even guessed diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|casenjo:  He knows if Martel gets he he will shift to a club honor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|phil: if youve never seen this system before, think of the standard auction of 1@c - 1@s - 2@s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: it was sort of a safety play, but not 100%|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think there are only 6 tricks if E-W get a second trump in before declarer can ruff a club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: but why not support spades after the 2@C checkback?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: the reasoning is partner needs a diamond stopper to beat hand, and declarer wont be finessing in spades with other options|pg||
pc|cT|nt|warrens:  I see 3 @S's, 2 @D's and 2 ruffs.  maybe an extra spade trick, but at best -500, so lose 9 imps or 12|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|iceking: 2sp was probably 10-13hcp and 6sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not an option  2@C is PUPPET to 2@D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne would make same bid with 4@S & 5@D|pg||
nt|dinos1: it's 2-way CB, must rebid 2@d|pg||
nt|ady: then may be better to support spades immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus some invitational hands|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  Could have made 7 by ruffing a club right away|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Al Hollander|pg||

nt|warrens:  N can now cash the @c K and exit a @D, -800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've played partnerships that frequently raise on 3  --  but south hand is clear 1N rebid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra:  I think N is about to get stuffed in |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: unfortunately he didnt have the @SK|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer has no losing options, will now finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, he is forced into that|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|dima:  Score one for agressive preempts|pg||

nt|henryb:  This is actually a fair game (needs a club guess or the heart finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: David, I think four teams are all-american, but there are 43 foreigh players left, and 50 Americans, given some random decisions on Lev, Pepsi,Shivdasani, Fallenius|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe Saelensminde could ask then? Maybe a bit different standard being nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: I do not have their current convention card. Sometimes they use 2@D as a weak major two-suiter (possibly 4-4) in the first two seats when NV against Vul. In that case the 2@S has a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: wider range than 8-11.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lev and Pepsi are both full time US residents; Fallenius was, but has resumed playing for Sweden|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|warrens:  e/w did well to stay out of 4@H at the other table.  this could be another swing for Strul.|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dima:  And also here strong result for EW in the other room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: west too flat for anything beyond 3@C|pg||
nt|ritong: brad puts it medium high|pg||
nt|phil: now, a component of this structure is that a 1@d opener promises an unbalanced hand most of the time|pg||
nt|ritong: now EW are in bad shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may have stolen this one |pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W play a forcing 1@c?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hopefully the weak notrump can be a double partial swing for EW|pg||
nt|fifee: great defensive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|ritong: because they can t at the same time establish a fit and use an exclusion BW afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Paul Gipson|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: A very borderline slam. I wonder if they will take a look at it.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  EW can make 2 spades and NS can make 3 clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: and I totally agree with that style I must say|pg||
nt|fifee: exactly henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: I think they are likely to reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|phil: if anyone has a cc for EW, please whisper it to me|pg||

nt|henryb:  wonder what their agreement is on XX?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: or at least bought it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do i detect a rooting interest?|pg||
nt|cicus: E took away the opponents' @H game in Open room|pg||
nt|fifee: here is the link to see the bracket list for the Spingold http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/spingold/|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Well, NS have been PERFECT...It would be nice to get the match closer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fair enough|pg||
nt|mich-b: 4@H is a good contract , and likely to make even on a @C lead|pg||
nt|ritong: they might stagger to a grand, though  but i think none of them could affirm " it s cold" before seeing part s hand|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will play 3NT      not that straight forward on a club lead   |pg||
pc|c9|nt|casenjo:  In the other room, Strul competed with 4 clubs, over 3 diamonds and South went down in 4 their diamond contract giving 6 more imps to Strul|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally I do not think it is very close to the border|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, you have to take the finesse before you have a chance to set up a discard on the clubs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know exactly what 2nt shows here, but it's clearly conventional.  Some pairs use 2@S artificially here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW used to play  Precision or Polish Club depending upon vulnerability -- it is possible they're always Precision now|pg||
nt|iceking: well he can pass 1sp respond and 1nt respond so wouldnt be any crime|pg||
nt|phil: the defense in the OR didnt attack clubs early enough, so declarer was able to set up a heart and 10 tricks rolled in|pg||
nt|dinos1: def can take 3@s and 1 @c, what else?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play 2@C does not guarantee a 4-card major   note that applies only to 2N rebid  3N absolutely has 4@H in Seamon sequence|pg||
nt|ady: seems so  but could go wrong|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: an easy rise to 4@h in my opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Linda Lee|pg||
nt|lml: hello :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dima:  I think Gromov-Dubinin use weak NT so it was straight invit|pg||

nt|dinos1: same 3N in OR|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Possible XX shows a @s honor; possible it shows values|pg||
pc|c7|nt|warrens:  oh, thanks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th seat 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|mich-b: in the OR Wast opened 1@D , and East responded 1@H ... after North declined the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|mich-b: he needs to win the @CA|pg||
nt|mich-b: cash some @D tricks , discarding his @Cs|pg||
nt|mich-b: and play a @S from dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: now declarer had better take this with the ace|pg||
nt|mich-b: or he can pitch 4@Ss on 4 @Ds|pg||
nt|pelu: also problems with @S-losers|pg||
nt|pelu: @H7 can come in play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|phil: splendid - sometimes the barrage bidding helps you too|pg||
nt|phil: on 35|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  It needs a spade break, a diamond finesse; about 18%|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Chip Martel was NPC for my Women's Team eons ago, but I am also very fond of Bjorn, so.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Either way it was a really good match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this defense is awkward for martel, as he does not know club king is a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play standard count/attitude and Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|casenjo:  Not a good slam|pg||
nt|po-s: And you will be disappointed when in spite of a successful dia finesse you go  down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: North South seem to be in an excellent contract which has the advantage of making|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Yes, you need two good things to go right. |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|po-s: heart from dummy?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: east is known to hold four minor cards|pg||
nt|cicus: to discard all the spades woud cut def communications even if it would be ruffed with a small trump|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those thinking West is too good for 1N  Kaplan Rubens Hand Evaluator says it is worth 15.05|pg||
nt|po-s: what about discarding two clubs, then a spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    really downgrades Queens - especially the unprotected @HQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: Platnick overtook the heart because he didnt want Diamond to give anything away with a switch.  a thoughtful partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  Seamon "knows" the @cK is offside from the opening bid|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: not sure he could afford that safety play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting line  --  best play for 3@D  and hope to get count to play for 4@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder why not duck @s10 after @dK?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  not to mention no club ruff on opening lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: help|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: problem comes when platnick has 5@C and TWO @S winners|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Discretion is the better part of valor on this hand, North got off to a nice lead, however South has blocked the suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  I think he can make it now.  @D J overtaken with the Q to set up the suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  or this way if they cover, even easier|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|po-s: If I were playing the DK would be offside, they would duck the club and spades would be 4-1. In four spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s would make more tricks than 3N, but 3N is certainly safe|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dinos1: but 3@d isnt enuff for contract|pg||

nt|mich-b: thx to specs who pointed this out|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i was quite excited|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit i probably would have done that at the table, but i think Cayne took best line|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South 1@D, West 1@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry only 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  another major suit game but a good save available this time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  Asya, you are doing fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for Dubinin-Gromov from 2010 European Championship  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/russia/gromov-dubinin.pdf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this 1nt is a game force|pg||
nt|cicus: was it here on BBO?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|bessi2: n-s on their way to an easy 3N as the cards lie|pg||
nt|iceking: dull 3nt coming up|pg||
nt|phil: Moss is a card carrying member of the 14 point NT (playing 15-17) club....but even he thinks this is a crummy hand|pg||
nt|lml: saves a few imps|pg||
nt|dinos1: u still have chances for @d fin and break in any red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I have never tried it but I suspect that my limit would be about two deals and six tricks. Then I would get a headache and pass it over to someone else.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have yet to figure out how they bid with a normal 1nt response|pg||
nt|iceking: S might dbl this|pg||
nt|paulg:  good but not great would be a better description|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i have copy of Struhl-Becker CC from 2009 trials -- not sure if it is still online|pg||
nt|dima:  They work a lot on their system ... some changes compared to the last european championship|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a normal 3N bid now.. knows east will lead short d if pd declares 4h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry had to look at what they put |pg||
nt|iceking: might go for penalty|pg||
nt|bessi2: dbl here is surely t/o  or ?|pg||
nt|iceking: he knows east has 0-1 d |pg||
nt|iceking: but i agree i would not dbl with so weak spots just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|bessi2: will be difficult to distinguish 4c Major and 5card Major if cant to dbl here|pg||
nt|lml: but best if they bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Interesting Becker did not have more constructive raise available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dima - when did they stop flip-flopping between Precision and Polish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Dont know exactly but they do switch a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D probably a random game try with @D length just a coincidence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: support double by fredin|pg||
nt|phil: dbl means = "do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|ritong: brad now and then tries a tactical opening, but doing so at unfav first seat would be delirious|pg||
nt|phil: call it tactical, but he loves to upgrade - moreso than Fred|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Limit raise in spades, Bergen|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: This is the bidding folks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dima:  Now North has a huge hand within double fit|pg||
nt|dima:  So it comes to 500 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch the other room in realtime using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead auction if passed out|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I tend to lead trump at low level contracts|pg||
nt|casenjo:  unless there is a glaring better lead|pg||
nt|cicus: well, congrats, not easy to defeat them in 28 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i agree|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzfe: Im sorry about the bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Alex will surely swing the axe now whether 5@d or 5@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And at this level of play, they lead the expected|pg||
nt|cicus: the meaning of the XX?|pg||
nt|cicus: smoke screen?|pg||
nt|pelu: exp: bid the 5-card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure what the dbl redbl means|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any good plan to play this?|pg||
nt|cicus: best suggestion by a spec: probably i have a preference that doesn't want the lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: this doesnt look likely to mkae|pg||
nt|pelu: I am still only up to 7 tricks :(|pg||
nt|mich-b: Lauria will soon have his @H suit established , and has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|po-s: now 3NT and Sementa might double...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: i doubt he can dbl this Pio he has no idea how many hcp NS have |pg||
nt|bessi2: that would be aggressive, pd obstructing green vs red|pg||
nt|phil: the main choices are pass and 4@h - pard won't always have 5@h for the x|pg||
nt|paulg:  we've missed a 1@s opener here, then Cayne has shown a singleton club and a raise to 4@s and Platnik has saved|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok, we're back to real time now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of love hate lead,   hope that was not a single @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond's 1N=14-16|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: good duck by kamil also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: leaving partner with another trump (hopefully)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Levin-Weinstein only beat 2 clubs by ONE trick, so a pickup by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|po-s: Sementa might - ok, no|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think this is the right auction|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bessi2: fallenius can't really afford to duck this... could be his 9th trick and diamonds rarely 5-2 anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: declerar cant go wrong here as the cards lie|pg||
nt|dinos1: trump lead is best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: since Dubinin DBLs it doesn't apply, but good point for partnerships to discuss if PASS would be forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all south bids are relays, no idea what fredin has shown so far|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: probably a club to king and another diamond lead now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did i mention the 5 minute think?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Rip Van Winkle Coup|pg||
nt|casenjo:  sit there long enuf that the opponents go to sleep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7NT actually looks slightly better than 7@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could survive with club jack third even if diamonds dont run|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: showing 19+ a 5-4-3-1 hand and 2 key cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what about the critical diamond queen|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe declarer can play spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can it be made if Fallenius wins on hand and plays on @s? @h are blocked!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: many play that forcing PASS applies only if he'd bid something stronger than 4@S on last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use standard count & attitude|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: but with no spade duplication, game in hearts is normal, frankly 4@s x'd looks par|pg||
nt|ritong: a good par, two off|pg||
nt|fifee: we saw 1 14 pt NT opener that truly went awry in the Strul Lynch match yesterday.  You can see it at http://tinyurl.com/2d9gxt5|pg||
nt|phil: what board Patty? |pg||
nt|fifee: click on board 32.  7D at the bottom and then click next to see the auction|pg||
nt|fifee: actually was 15 point NT at one table|pg||
nt|fifee: excuse me 13 pt :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no @S.....I am sure Aker is pondering entire hand now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He must keep @SQ in dummy, then he should be OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I meant worrisome lead from declarers point of view originally,  not now |pg||
nt|ritong: i m not sure what his worries are|pg||
nt|ritong: what can happen if he plays a @h now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That North wins and continues clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: keep to 2 more losers and make 4   |pg||
nt|ritong: well, @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: @d Q overtake|pg||
nt|ritong: after cashing @h Q|pg||
nt|brolucius: I like to spend around 10 seconds of every minute (at least) half-asleep. This is not a prime requirement for being a VG operator.|pg||
nt|phil: wow 7@d x'd - bizarre in this event|pg||
nt|ritong: isporski plays for@hK9 with his part|pg||
nt|ritong: not impossible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- they do follow the trend of changing range in 3rd vul and 4th|pg||
pc|h3|nt|casenjo:  Weinstein and Levin limped into 6 diamonds after a misunderstood keycard auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kickback misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South showed a powerhouse and then bid 4NT, signed off in 6 diamonds, thinking he was off a keycard.|pg||
nt|phil: would require a minor trick too|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|casenjo:  North never showed his huge hand and just bid 6.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  good contract, although unsuccessful|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: that might fail against a desperately unlucky 2-2 trump break - this is not straightforward|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That does not happen at this level of play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i expect to be wrong after that much thinking|pg||
nt|iceking: correct line |pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: now there are|pg||
nt|pelu: unexp mistake by Lauria|pg||
nt|mich-b: now declarer is surely making|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: well it is only a 50-50 grand slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but a missed opportunity|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s trying to tangle him up |pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he saw south discarding on the first round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when 1N=14(+)-17|pg||
pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  Now west is thinking, :what was south thinking"|pg||
nt|casenjo:  East had overcalled 2 spades, so the auction: 1D - 1S - 2S by south. When Levin bid 4NT I think he assumed that diamonds were trump and Weinstein showed only one keycard, not thinking that the king of diamonds was a keycard|pg||
nt|dinos1: K|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mich-b: I wander why both Easts decided that their pd is not likely to have the @HJ|pg||
nt|ady: loks like 50 to  n/s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: soloway use to sleep, others to knit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fleisher does not want to lead a spade because then diamond queen will cash|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and he doesn't want to lead a heart either, he really wants to pass the lead to someone else|pg||
nt|cicus: that XX may have confused Lauria|pg||
nt|bessi2: to bad us commentators can't claim the contracts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|warrens:  good @c shift by W, ensuring -2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: perhaps the initial duck in spades was so smooth he does not know the layout|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: so he did - sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|casenjo:  Things are still unlucky on these hand, are we the unlucky group or is there a pattern? :):)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cT|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: i have my joker now, i might escape your whip next time i blunder:)|pg||
nt|phil: sneaky little ploy to get an 11th trick|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb:  If any kibitzers see a strange auction, leave the table and come back. You will see the right auction|pg||

nt|brolucius: everyone...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Luckily i kept up with them with the playing|pg||
nt|warrens:  low from doubletons, i presume|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like polish methods - low from doubleton|pg||
nt|casenjo:  double partial swing gains 7 more for the leaders|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so it was blackwood versus keycard, another unsettled problem |pg||
nt|cicus: he could not hope for @SQxx with W|pg||
nt|phil: but Val doesnt bite|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: We wouldn´t dream of it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many eastern europeans lead low from small doubleton, but that isn't how their CC is marked [going back to 2008 world championships]|pg||
nt|mich-b: maybe he hoped for Jxx|pg||
nt|mich-b: and a misguess by declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: well, Jxx might do as well, but then small @H lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: On board 5 in the open room please ignore the 2cl bid in the end lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Haha. Yesterday when Seamon-Cayne was declaring a 3@C contract on @CAJxx opp x, people were telling me that it must be wrong. But -600 was the net result of 6 off vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i play all keycard if we have bid even one suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, but they have played long enough to know that a cuebid followed by 4NT immediately shows support for opener|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I meant together long enough|pg||
nt|fifee: skimpy @S slam here|pg||
nt|paulg:  do you overcall 2@H?|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is very close but I would with the chunky suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  they are playing quickly at this table, and offline at the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  transfer overcall|pg||
nt|dinos1: pass?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|henryb:  Do I? only in a weak matchpoint field|pg||
nt|dinos1: y|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond is the only team in the Semi-Final without at least 1 European pair|pg||
nt|ady: 8 tricks   quiet hands so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/w game in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@C probably forced by system|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Well, the bad heart split stops 6 hearts from making|pg||
nt|po-s: On 19 Fredin played 2S just making on a 6-1 fit. Cayne went down in 4H which he could have made (should?)|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like they play up the line standard |pg||
nt|lml: what about you Paul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  tempted at this vul|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on board 4    Versace played @CJ and Moss won the 1st trick  tried @H then took finesse in @D   so he didn't touch @S either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: dashing into 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
nt|casenjo:  This table is playing VERY fast, as you can see only 2 boards have been finished in the other room|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Our poor VG operator is getting a workout|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold protection from Brogeland, perhaps recalling his success in the LM Pairs.|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, the other table is not online.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The open room has been down for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The other table the open room its server is down all i can ask of everyone who wants to watch the other pairs is be patient|pg||
nt|casenjo:  misclick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told they actually did keycard and 4nt was queen ask|pg||
nt|henryb:  I prefer Seamon's approach: overcall after the opponents have limited their hands|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @d switch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: named after the Canadian Doug Drury who got tired of going down when his partner Eric Murray opened in 3rd seat with approximately 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so they knew they were missing the queen and settled for 6|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: Fredin will bal for sure here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this looks almost inevitable to be bid now|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Many 2/1 players abuse clubs when they want to force to game, but would liketo hear more rather than jumpto 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i must admit i prefer the 3NT bid in open room, though here is a matter of luck that it will gain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this time the weak no trump has worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: nice stop by NS |pg||
nt|pelu: nice stop in both rooms - 20-21/ +4|pg||
nt|mich-b: many pairs would be in 3NT here|pg||
nt|bessi2: dont they play transfer responses to 1club ?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ulf Nilsson has been encouraging me (and others) to overcall on these hands ... of course he can play the cards better than many|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Who wants to watch the other table when Boye and Eric are here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no 1D-2S-3S-P-4H-P-4NT; Levin made 2 bids, spade cuebid and 4NT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Someone lied to you again|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that both rooms would be in 3Nt is vuln :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I have passed a 2NT opening with such a hand...|pg||
nt|iceking: if they do 1nt sure looks strange respond|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: I thought they did|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting to see what Hampson does, he is one of the more aggressive US players|pg||
nt|dinos1: well, S can saet @s trick now|pg||
nt|ady: 9th trick appeared|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about the 2@D bid    typically  opener would show @H with any hand that had game interest|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 2@h wd show min?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse drury   2@S would have said  [i've got junk|pg||
nt|dinos1: with hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   min with @S & @H would just bid 2@S with known 8+ fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anything other than 2@S shows at least game interest|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bessi2: well.. doesn't look that way after 1N right you are|pg||
nt|dinos1: .|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Gazzilli; an immediate 2@D would be limited to 14|pg||
nt|sybarra: make coffee, pour a glass of wine or whatever |pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c natural or some good hand; 2@d a kind of waiting bid; 3@d some good hand|pg||
nt|ritong: i really love this convention, and i m sure it is the one which will spread the most soon|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer who is an expert at evaluating BBO commentators tells me, reassuringly, that only 1 crazy comment out of every 6 puts me well into the top 10%.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, Bal-Zmud are worth watching too, Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  That assumes, David, that your estimate of 83% sensible comments is accurate|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Our operator is trying to get a runner to get him scores from the other room, we did this at the at the Team Trials a few years back|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS   standard count, reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dima:  Russian team has missed the qualification spot for the Bermuda Bowl by less then penalties during the last European championship|pg||
nt|phil: another mundane hand. Will probably make 5|pg||
nt|phil: although I think 6 is there is he plays wide open and guesses clubs|pg||
nt|phil: *if|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: this table is 3 boards ahead of everyone else so it will be difficult to make helpful comparisons :(|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Not so sure with regard to the other side of the pond|pg||
nt|dburn: best have a lot of tens before you use it - every one of them here is working hard|pg||
nt|ritong: but it does not fit well with forcing Nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT forcing is ok if you play it unlimited but fleisher judged hand too strong for that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No they don't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|fifee: ruff a couple of @Hs and low toward the @CK makes 6 |pg||
nt|phil: well that requires him to leave a trump out|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like declarer must go down 1 as long as Diamond keeps his hands off the @sJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|warrens:  I know that on board 3 they played in 4@S, so 6 imps to Lynch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fourth diamond will promote a trump|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|phil: on his way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: It does; the Italians play a forcing 1NT response|pg||
nt|fifee: for a short time :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, not clear to move in Standard after 1@h-1@s-2@d-2@h|pg||
nt|cicus: but, as I am made aware, 4@H is not at all a bad contract - only goes down on a spade lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: is far from clear and not actually necessary at this point|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores  for R32 results and pairings in the R16|pg||
nt|iceking: so 1nt was just natural denies major |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: probably fits well (as 2/1 player)  but need to think about implications |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe if we threaten them with Gazzilli, they'll let us have Multi, an American spectator suggests|pg||
nt|ritong: italians play a relatively complicated version, with 2@c two wayed, either nat with @cs or a good hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont get me started Roland |pg||
nt|phil: home now - have to bid these slams guys :)|pg||
nt|lml: but 3@D or 2@S is probably a make|pg||
nt|lml: so not terrible|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm told Hampson passed ... more than once|pg||
nt|henryb:  Platnick is now endplayed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now it is clear|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: board 4 3NT should have gone down as the play went in OR   defence let it through|pg||
pc|s6|nt|casenjo:  now they score they trump separately|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: well, maybe 4@H is better than 2NT|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: Just the ability to compete|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: italians play a gazzilli thing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its not always about points Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: where 2@c rebid shows extras +|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|poohbear: yea but not when the opps overcall 2@c :)|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe they have agreed that double replaced gazzilli, once, and forgot or modified and forgot|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|poohbear: thats alot of forgots!|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, it is not always about points? they lied to me?:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime declarer is playing to set up @s|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, a lot of forgots  how do you explain a free 63@h bid otherwise|pg||
nt|poohbear: has 4 tricks in and 2@ds and possible 2 trumps for 8|pg||
nt|poohbear: in fact 8 is a stretch|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: .|pg||
nt|ritong: salut peter|pg||
nt|ritong: i need help, goren talks to me as if i was 16:)|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|poohbear: If declarer plays king now he can cash 2@ds and ruffa @c for 8|pg||
nt|pelu: ok good morning to all from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|poohbear: 16 in dog years Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: good one|pg||
nt|ritong: your case is worse and worse:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: We can see the difference in the Italian style and the Swedish style . In the other room they did not overcall 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: how is the situation between Fredin and Lauria - in 1. segment Fredin called TD several times|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SQT8HA6432DKJ7CAQ,SA63H75DAT9CJT954,S954HK98DQ642CK83,SKJ72HQJTD853C762|sv|b|nt|ritong: which suppresses the ambiguous side of 2@c bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  Look, I might also, but I think Brogeland and Saelensminde are a treat in their own way|pg||
nt|po-s: David, in order to avoid being accused of embarrassing you I´ll switch table|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no doubt about removing 3@C doubled, partly because South had not spoken - at favourable vulnerability - on the first round.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Okay im getting a runner to give me results on the other team|pg||
nt|cicus: what happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting - why?|pg||
nt|mich-b: I thought that was Fredin's "plan"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: North was upset with Easts thinking with his small clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: In the end|pg||
nt|mich-b: either the @CK will drop , or he will call the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Exactly|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see no problem with the pause by Lauria - he has to decide: @c or @s discard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can the director make the king drop?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I agree with Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: On the 7 trick east was thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ehhh  Lund (not Fredin)|pg||
nt|mich-b: Roland , you agree with which Peter?|pg||
nt|mich-b: Ahhh ..ok :)|pg||
nt|ady: another quiet part score hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, Alfredo has ducked @s10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 30  Meltzer leads by 1   [this set 20-0]|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: rebid*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As David pointed out, the auction might die in 2@H wihout this gadget, as happened at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15(+)-18(-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: match is rapidly getting out of hand|pg||
nt|fifee: this hand is not mundane |pg||
mb|2N|nt|dima:  Some action again here|pg||
nt|dima:  If Gromov passes he will have a chance to double 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gromov choices are P, 4@S, RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness started with PASS but let them off the hook later in the auction|pg||
nt|dima:  East hand looks like a lot of defence and he faces 2nd seat VUL preempt|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North can make a slam here, south gets a heart lead through and goes down|pg||
nt|casenjo:  But, will they get that high?|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed i wonder why that is|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c is a good contract, needing 3-2 clubs and one of the kings onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  P.O. Stay! there is no other table to watch|pg||
nt|dima:  So we are for business here|pg||
nt|po-s: "started" is not quite accurate|pg||
nt|henryb:  6N is not quite as good: needs the @cK on|pg||
nt|paulg:  always nice to see vulnerable opponents when you open a strong club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: 7@d was also bid by Platnick and Diamond, although looking at the auction, there may have been guess work involved, but I cant tell for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Or will they play in diamonds or NT from the north?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2sp 5+ @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: alert probably because  "could have 4@H/@S"|pg||
nt|ady: the hand belongs to e/w in the majors   but they are not in the aution yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1N is down some tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe I can find a document with 28 pages of Gazzilli system notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: "accepting the transfer with a good hand |pg||
nt|henryb:  @h + longer minor?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman's 1N is weaker so Moss PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh what a difference a +/- makes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/bulletins/2010/02/6/  pages 8&9 for team rosters|pg||
nt|brolucius: South buys a great dummy, just as his partner did on the previous deal.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6D from north is best, again not great but clearly an opportunity for the trailing team|pg||
nt|iceking: this will not make but nothing they could do normal bidding|pg||
nt|fifee: 5 is not cold here|pg||
nt|phil: optimum spot and 11 tricks are a lock|pg||
nt|paulg:  3NT probably minimum without a 4-card major, or perhaps any 4333|pg||
nt|dinos1: Cayne didnt want to bid 1N with low @h doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea that began with Walsh -- when responder bids 1@D = either no major or strong enough to bid over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10 shows @CJ  [Rusinow]|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dima:  A good point to discuss with your reg partner, most play XX = pls stay out of my way|pg||
nt|phil: ruff hearts, draw trump and play @sAK and a low one|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: that locks ten|pg||
nt|fifee: certainly fred will overtake to lead the @C|pg||
nt|phil: oh. |pg||
nt|phil: blind spot :)|pg||
nt|fifee: even if brad leads the club. still a @C loser|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
nt|fifee: those old 4333 hands will get you in trouble|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dima:  Xmas arrives and 2@s trick go through to boot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 philosophies   1 says if pure defensive hands  PASS then DBL  so that RDBL then DBL is more cooperative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other says RDBL first to enlist partner  but RDBL/DBL says PEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it helps to be on same page as partner :)|pg||
nt|cicus: thin game|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dima:  The heat is on - now they might get to @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul wishes to find a bid to say YOU choose :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Strul wants to RE-RDBL  to say  no-no  YOU choose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our comments crossed in the ether Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  happens from time to time :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either  a) assume more likely 5@D than 5@H  OR  b) bid 4@H because it is game|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think you care too much about GAME here :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: updates after each segment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this one i think levin-weinstein may try|pg||
nt|cicus: of course I understand that Versace upgraded his hand|pg||
nt|cicus: his @Hs could have been 65432|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: they figure to still be behind a lot, which makes even 40% slams right to bid|pg||
nt|mich-b: regarding the director call on previous board - there is nothing wrong with that , of course|pg||
nt|bessi2: i adhere to your knowledge po-s, at leas first time I remember seeing this conventions was by the italians|pg||
nt|dinos1: @s10 made S hand as max)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: well, for our specs interested, google is your friend|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.freewebs.com/bobbybridge/conventions/Gazzilli%20Convention.htm  here is a shorter version|pg||
nt|ritong: roland is your friend as well|pg||
nt|dburn: just how strong was 1NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-17|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting: Neither Lauria nor Seamon overcalled  with the heart hand on previous board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|casenjo:  24 imps have been gained by NS when EW misread slam hands; Board 34 6 diamonds was made in the other room and on 38 they stopped in game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense signal problem here|pg||
nt|phil: is there a legitimate chance besides @sQj in the slot? |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dima:  This rather about the first digit in front of 00|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right - i was just trying to come up with any rationale for Strul making a choice|pg||
nt|dima:  And Alexander Dubinin comes to help with @d - lovely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would North bid the same way with 4@H 5@D?|pg||
nt|dima:  Strul is going to have some more grey hair till this board is over|pg||
nt|dima:  I think one MIGHT bid 4@d with 5@d and 4@h as some kibs point out|pg||
nt|ritong: ho hum|pg||
nt|ady: this will be expensive for n/s|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s4@h1@d for def|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: I think it is unclear since there is always a [slim] chance that partner won't be able to bid EITHER red suit|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well now one still has to play the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South could easily be  3226|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: yes phil, but is somewhat exotic:)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N might have more 'practical' chances|pg||
nt|fifee: yes, who needs a @H stopper?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Not me|pg||
nt|fifee: hi Asya :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: :D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dima:  With that it might be more prudent to run from 4@c XX to 5@c :)|pg||
nt|dima:  And they will get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with natural trump trick isn't it?|pg||
nt|dima:  So let's see - 2@s + 1@c + 2@h + 1@d that is 800 to begin with|pg||
nt|dburn: that may be all - not so bad|pg||
nt|dima:  could be worse from Strul's perspective :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but hearts would have been better - perhaps not really possible to get to those, since Strul wasn't allowed to reredouble 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we ponder I'd like to retract an earlier statement of mine   Gromov-Dubinin have always played Precision throughout   i was thinking of a different pair [martens-jassem] who ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play Precision or Polish depending upon vul|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: NS play udca so in principle fallenius diamond was encouraging|pg||
nt|mich-b: if one thinks opp's tempo has mislead him|pg||
nt|pelu: need to play @c now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ in East makes South hand max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good split in both red suits :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: which wasn't long ago mind you, probably been around before that without me knowin|pg||
nt|iceking: 2H from Fallenius was not normal weak 2 bid it shows sound hand 10-13hcp |pg||
nt|iceking: Transfers after one club started i think in USA |pg||
nt|fifee: next :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the other legitimate chance is to find one with 7222 and @c KJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: and South drove to game with a nondescript seven count? boy, these guys are tough|pg||
nt|iceking: Al Roth probably didnt he invent all conventions anyway:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: however fredin knows any diamond tricks are not disappearing so he goes passive|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  [and NS] play Smith Echo vs NT -- but Platnick primary signal in @D would be count|pg||
nt|ady: assuming they will eventually get their spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond needed mirrors to beat the hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dima:  Gromov-Dubinin play variable NT - 12+-15 in 1/2 and 15-17 in 3/4th|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Nothing wrong with that at all. That's why we have directors|pg||
nt|dinos1: how?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: They play the cards well; they don't need so many points|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: team rosters: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2010/02/SPINGOLD/  for all of them, also the ones that are knocked out|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - good morning from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|dinos1: if not @s now then -1|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1st @s lead and duck?|pg||
nt|ady: still can make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess since @D33 declarer can always get 9|pg||
nt|dinos1: y|pg||
nt|ady: nice swing for cayne|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: a bit smaller than @s QJ on:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dima:  Now Gromov surely has a complete count since Strul would bid 4@h with 4 of those|pg||
nt|ady: -1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: a play even I could find on a good day|pg||
nt|dinos1: strange|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Peter|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Nickell is now down 53 and running out of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are other words besides 'strange' that might apply|pg||
nt|ady: worried south had 9XX spades?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|casenjo:  Things are not boding well for Fleisher. He does not rate to make this hand, while his teammates are about to go down in 3 hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: no need in smith for @s coz E has encouraged it at tr.1|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: maybe he does, unless of course that @c4 could be low from two|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bessi2: i'm sure freding didn't mind that development in the bidding|pg||
mc|9|nt|warrens:  hmm, what now?|pg||

nt|iceking: not much in the play 2 down |pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: (referring to   of calls of course)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ritong: i had none:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 450 is a lot of tricks. Declarer must have cashed the @s ace at some point|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: another NT opening with a singleton. I saw Brogeland do it in another match last qtr|pg||
nt|pelu: i exp Fredin to do the same - the best play for only 1 @s-loser|pg||
nt|poohbear: becoming more and more common to open 1NT with stiff honors |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: but does he have 10 tricks?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|poohbear: must be 14-16|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|pelu: a very "conservativ" pass by Fallenius|pg||
nt|ritong: very|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont think Fallenius pass is conservative. But I do think if I opened 1NT with a side singleton I might find a superaccept over my partner's transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: if 14-16 then Fredin sh jump to 3@s (max and good cards)|pg||

nt|casenjo:  so, this is 5 more for DeKnijff|pg||
nt|phil: EW play a strong club and I dont think theyll get there|pg||
nt|fifee: 3@D in the other room :)  you win Phil|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi Po :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great info Andy!!!    keep it coming with the table chat|pg||
nt|dinos1: encouraging wasnt enuff? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@h-1@s, and S?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: in case you weren't with us -- you missed an incredible 2nd set in the final of the women's ko [Wagar] where Dinkin made a successful defense of the title by an entire TWO imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Dorothy Truscott |pg||
nt|dburn: but that was a good effort all round - declarer kept his head, and the defenders needed to be and were accurate at the finish|pg||
nt|pelu: same result in OR - @h-lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was Greco who passed in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|casenjo:  They have gained 33 imps in 7 hands..that is a LOT|pg||
nt|bessi2: very good 6h here|pg||
nt|phil: I'll start a page for you in my rather large book of coke accounting Patty :)|pg||
nt|fifee: heh|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny years ago |pg||
nt|casenjo:  When things like this happen to me, I find it is a good idea to get upn and get a glass of water|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S interesting bid, it would be a splinter or stopper ask for most partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open Big @C|pg||
nt|ady: might make this on a heart lead    5@C  safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not sure if there will be any more info about the table - everyone seems very dead serious lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond's actions will all deny 3+@S    [3=RDBL  4=raise]|pg||
mb|p|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: apparently fallenius plays it as stopper showing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H implies spade fit, and lead directing by a passed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a two edged sword though, as might help defense if you end in spade contract|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: spades? anyone got any spades?|pg||
nt|iceking: will get there i bet|pg||
nt|phil: ok I have to tend to things - enjoy everyone|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h lead - 9th trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great dummy from Cayne|pg||
nt|dinos1: better if he had @dA :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf  for a longer version of Gazzilli, 18 pages. Worth reading if you have nothing better to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very productive 24-count, partly because both hands are 4-3-3-3.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the way the broadcast is set up, Asya can't enter results from the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no suits break|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT 18-19.|pg||
nt|dima:  Who needs spades :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|bessi2: i'm pretty sure they will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other two matches after 16: Jacobs +41 and Dawson +16|pg||
nt|iceking: 3clubs probably shows sound hand now 3h and off they go|pg||
nt|bessi2: still wonder why he bypassed the spades, but I am not privy to their bidding understandings|pg||
nt|dinos1: now NS may be in 5@c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- the unbeatable 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: stopped n/s going down if west leads spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@c is cold with @d fin|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if you want to score plus 420 instead of plus 110, you need spades - and you need to bid them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kamil is either also bidding tactically or not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in modern bridge we alert all natural bids (sarcastically)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 4+@D, unbal    they open weak NT with 44441@D|pg||
nt|paulg:  Seamon deciding that 2NT is unlikely to make unless the diamonds come in, so worth looking for 5-3 spade fit and just concede more 50s in 3NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: not easy to lead @s vs 3N - S might have @sAQ|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder why pass 4@d and not bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zaleski Meltzer match has  1-0 for this set  versus our 3-0|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: now iam lost does this promice spade quebid|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - of course - Lauria had the spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: i second that|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was Dorothy Hayden then,  thx Joost |pg||
nt|ritong: a friendly dummy to come|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it possible for Brogeland to show restraint ever? No!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I will get results from someone sooner or later|pg||
nt|po-s: I was  a bit surprised - Lauria would have|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s by N?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: This is a contract even I can make, also at 4:55 am. 6 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said joost,  meant Jack Oest    |pg||
nt|casenjo:  I'm surprised at Kamil, it is pretty normal to have support for spades on this auction, since west is  a passed hand, he didn;t open 2 hearts....|pg||
nt|pelu: so it looks like a lot of european players in the round of 8|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb by W?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not nearly as exciting as the last 2 sets of the Wagar [Ladies KO] Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S giving Seamon choice between 4N and 5@C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|ritong: i dunno|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: We will see if Erik can make bricks out of straw.|pg||
nt|dima:  Probably did not like the idea of having to find a bid after 1@d - 1@s - 2@d - ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C was 6+@C, 9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|bessi2: some special cuebidding agreement i guess|pg||
nt|iceking: ok 3sp 4d probably shortness for them 3nt denies shortness looks like |pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, 4@s BY N is vg bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with help in @S   Cayne could bid 4N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didnt mean to click alreat|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  seems very logical after he raised to 3c|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl can ruff TWO @d's for +1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|brolucius: No hurry to test the hearts, clearly. Instead declarer tries to make something of the diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It will take a while|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh what is this |pg||
nt|iceking: 4nt turbo or something |pg||
nt|iceking: aha Fredin responding with clubs as trumps i really dont believe that |pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to give partner @D ruff looks best|pg||
nt|dinos1: stiff @sA is known|pg||
nt|ady: not likely singleton diamond to pass 4@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- Diamond passed 4@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: oh, indeed he didn't, and I have a lot of sympathy with the choice of 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West open 1@D - and S  X and bid 3NT over 1@h - @s-lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: interesting that neither pair could find the @S fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: One trick back, but not enough I think|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well, you were right, he made 1 brick|pg||
nt|po-s: OK in clubs too|pg||
nt|bessi2: maybe 4N turbo even number of aces and 5d asking for trump Q|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 4nt was 6keycard asking |pg||
nt|iceking: not sure how that works no idea what they are playing here|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt any swedes play Turbo|pg||
nt|bessi2: they got to the top spot, and although I dont understand the bidding, I am sure they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|bessi2: I sure miss playing turbo.. bridge is too easy when you can just ask for aces|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what i find it a bit pushy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember how annoyed I used to get, every time a team-mate said 'Going to 3NT didn't matter. We couldn't make 2NT.'  Ah, yes, very wise. For most people that would be an ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: excellent reason not to bid 3NT. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: I haven't noticed any extra bricks appearing yet.|pg||
nt|bessi2: or keycards to be more precise|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|fifee: EW playing 3@H on board 40 at the open room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfe: Small break now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well judged auction from Cayne-Seamon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with the break i don't think any other table will catch up |pg||
nt|ady: yes  and no   they could have played 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N wd be =, with @h lead)|pg||
nt|dinos1: cdnt 4@d be bid as just lead-directing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: There has been a small problem in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sementa is feeling unwell and a doctor has been asked for|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: As a result, the play has been put on hold until further notice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel just posted  "Sementa just said to me that his wife might be watching and I should tell her that he's feeling better and not to worry"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but she also said play will stop and he's being taken to hospital -- let's keep good thoughts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: A tournament director has come to our table and is picking up the boards from this set. Because a break has been taken and every board is duplicated in other matches of BBO, the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: rest of the boards are likely to be dead and change to a new set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The tournament director has now informed the players that Lauria-Versace will most likely be filling in for Duboin-Sementa in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Jan: "EMT asks whether Sementa flew today? We all said not today - he's a heavy smoker. They're getting him on the stretcher to take to the hospital."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Jan: "Alfredo says: "In case you die, you played very well today" - lots of laughter except from the EMT who says "don't talk about dying" "|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Ok, both teams have now come to an agreement|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Lauria-Versace will now fill in in the Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Both teams have compared the scores of the first 6 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They will now complete a new set of 10 boards in which we hope that there is a file for these boards to be broadcasted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: This room will now be closed - see you guys soon hopefully |pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Not that I am criticising South, here, for bidding 3NT. That was the normal action opposite 18-19, of course.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down only two, not bad versus easy 3nt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Sælensminde-Brogeland back together after they split up (amicably) in 2007 after Norway won the Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|sybarra: some day in the future, the USA will adopt running scores..............|pg||
nt|ritong: the top spot is 6NT by north|pg||
nt|ritong: and certainly antonio sementa will consider this option in fine|pg||
nt|ritong: because of his stranded @hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: so where do you start the bidding with N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C I presume|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like a game forcing hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and looking at E hand, I sympathize,  like my rubber bridge hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would start with 2 @C |pg||
nt|po-s: Aha, that´s why you call the raise to 3NT "normal" - never say anything negative about a co-author|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Eric made his bricks out of straw|pg||
nt|brolucius: I always used to admire the English player Robert Sheehan. He would write articles in Bridge Magazine with such asL 'Flint and I got into a terrible mess on this deal...'.  I was ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: so impressed! It made me think: Wow! He must be some player if he can put his mistakes into print. |pg||
nt|jtr: @h|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sally Brock wrote a book that included several deals that had not gone well. She had my admiration for it. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay i have some results from the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 3 4 spades by south making 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 4- 3 no trump by west making 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 5- 5hearts doubled by west down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: board 6 are playin 3sp by east|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6-7 IMPs to be added|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Good players should be able to do that. in "My 60 memorable games" chess champion Bobby Fisher included several of his own defeats too.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The open room is back now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, the tables are not linked so that won't help a lot as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: He seems lovely|pg||
nt|casenjo:  it appears to be 17-6 Strul after the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Sry |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am tempted to predict that this will be the world's flattest 3NT. We will see.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even Reese was self-deprecating at times. 'I am about to play a diamond when, at the last minute, I realise that...'|pg||
nt|dima:  The bidding was the same|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 4@s wasn;'t cold, but it would have been more interesting to watch than 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at least Gromov played it quickly|pg||
nt|dima:  THAT is true :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only difference is that Helgemo's 1@D was 4+ but could have been balanced|pg||
nt|dima:  And playing Precision you dont have a lot of power to make 4@s after opening at most 24 points so go with 7-card suit|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Reese called those 7411 girafe hands or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: quick break|pg||
nt|dima:  Kibs suggest swans and cologne :)|pg||
nt|dburn: both correct|pg||
nt|dima:  In any case Reese claimed that those hands should be played in 7-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the range for NS weak 2s is 6-12   it's been a long long time since i've seen that range|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This will be another push.Fleisher needs to pick up 32 imps in 8 boards|pg||
nt|mich-b: sorry all , have to leave now, enjoy the rest|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks Michael|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Guess right now north is talking about previous hand |pg||

nt|bessi2: deknijff milking many small swings this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Short break now|pg||
nt|lml: I have to head out now too.  Thanks everybody.|pg||
nt|paulg:  bye Linda|pg||
nt|paulg:  another decision -- 1@d, 1NT or double after Cayne's 1@c opener?|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT would probably be effective here, but is potentially quite dangerous|pg||
nt|henryb:  I confess I would bid 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: And they're back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer v Zaleski halftime score  34 - 33 in favor of Meltzer|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: may depend on vulnerability to an extent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if North can have 12 then South should bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only qualifier on their CC is  "may be light 3rd favorable vul"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know is not a popular view, but i go for swings on every board at this stage|pg||
nt|ritong: brad would open 1NT easily|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: When you have put your foot into it 50 times, you cease worrying about the 51st time.|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8 team here in R8 are very international: 8 players from Italy, 4 from Norway, 6 from Bulgaria, 4 from France, 2 from Sweden , 2 from Egypt - and a lot of US-players|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Tables are linked now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room operator catching up|pg||
nt|dima:  Try :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids, North may take the view that his 6-4 shape entitles him to show a maximum|pg||
nt|iceking: you get alot of joy writing plus score after plus score |pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: standing after 3. segment: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I was surprised that the other room didn't bid 7D on 53 or 6D on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: but a good pair needs an active guy and a calm one:)|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Would not MANY of us think it is maximum even within 6-12 range|pg||
nt|dburn: and if all of that comes to pass, North-South will reach a pushy game that they will not make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't describe replies to 2N :(|pg||
nt|ady: game in either major for n/s|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfer responses opposite 1@C nowadays|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They know they need it|pg||
nt|iceking: another good spot |pg||
nt|paulg:  this will be a few imps back for Cayne|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|po-s: are yoy sure about 4H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now will Cayne show @S support?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h is -1 on @d promotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry should be more forceful about that    now Cayne will show 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: first step OK right sided NTs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: exactly|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Dawson Mahaffey and the DIamond match were both only 4 imp differences going into the 4th quarter|pg||
nt|cicus: Versace has gadget over 1ba openinig: 3@c = 5@h/4@s GI|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks spec for info|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: artificiality follows, as they say|pg||
nt|ritong: they certainly have a way to reach 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: hang on a minute - I hadn't thought of that game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best line now looks to be win diamond,draw two trumps then play diamonds|pg||
nt|casenjo:  South shouldl not anticipate anything strange|pg||
nt|fifee: same contract at the other table. same lead|pg||
nt|ritong: but braddy considers this contract with some disdain:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is check-back, looking for a spade or heart fit.|pg||
nt|dima:  Apparently neither did Becker :)|pg||
nt|dburn: neither had Becker, though I am not sure he was allowed to overrule his partner - depends on the details of their agreements|pg||
nt|iceking: very nice lead unlucky Duboin doesnt have Jack stiff of clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: now aren't you glad you're wearing your seat belts?|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe the rules are: direct 3NT = shut up, 2NT+3NT = allowed to think?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not keen on 3@H, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahem   NOW cayne will show 3@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: lol|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not making on diamond leads  aas kib pointed out|pg||
pc|dT|nt|casenjo:  The opponents hold 18 HCP and 10 hearts and never entered the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't really matter -- 3N is fine contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|casenjo:  me too, i like to bid what i have, especially which such great spots in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond jack lead may set this|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Sometimes the Moysian fit is right, both 3NT and 4 spades work on this hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess West would lead a club against 3NT, and in practice it would not make either|pg||
nt|pelu: big problems with communication|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin can duck spades twice and then i count only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  The opponents can take 2 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the last trick|pg||
nt|pelu: but are there 9 tricks for decl?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south only has 2 clubs, he will probably have togive stansby the heart and spade in dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: @h lead to save an imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2NT=asking, usually balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D=1 suiter in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H=At least 1 top honour in spades, 3@S=6+@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think 3 hearts is Smolen, 4 hearts, 5 spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: I am told they are playing 'a sort of Blue Club'.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: i think actually the defense is easy, declarer almost certainly has the actual shape|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am glad they wrote this out for you Andy,  we were slightly lost |pg||
nt|dburn: not actually clear that 6NT by North is best - maybe 6@s by North is better|pg||
nt|dima:  Hmmm can declarer drop @h King now?|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess at double dummy this may have a chance also, but in practice I doubt very much that Becker will make it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Well, at least my prediction of 'world's most obvious 3NT' did not go down the chute. Not that I was sticking my neck out very far with that. |pg||
nt|casenjo:  So,it would appear things are splitting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes suggests even breaks|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 6 from France|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: difficult lead for Fallenius|pg||
nt|pelu: lead in OR: @s4 to King and @D back|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: mind you he has knocked out the right ace|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can now get home|pg||
nt|ritong: i am extremely biased in this table composition, but not to the point to say " wd brad"  i just hate passing his hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Andy - please thank the players for us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West might have employed Michaels (2@H to show spades and a minor). That is not good when you have six spades and five in the minor, but OK when the suits are this way round.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Everything's well now. Scoreline correct|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3NT is a much easier contract than 4Hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but 4@sX might be even better|pg||

pc|d2|nt|casenjo:  looking for action?|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Grant Baze: "6-5 come alive"|pg||
nt|dima:  True|pg||
nt|dburn: may or may not be a good time for the dread four-card-suit overcall|pg||

pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: transfer response to 1@C, and 2@D artificial game force|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe had stansby bid 4@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: South's hand was too slam-worthy for Brogeland to bid 4@H, probably. 3NT will show no shortage.|pg||
nt|dima:  I think Strul will have a good picture after defence takes 3 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: dont u like my 4@c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: have not seen it yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh what is 4c, would be splinter for me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fallenius is the slowest of the four|pg||
nt|cicus: do they talk much?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  A long time ago, in the semi-finals of the Wagar, I correctly calculated that we were trailing going into the last board, so I put my partner in 6 spades, they led their ace and she claimed and we went on to win the match by 4 and the event|pg||
nt|bessi2: strange method|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The only slow Italian pair is Fantunes, mainly because of Fulvio :)|pg||
nt|cicus: W is a luckier hand for declaring 3NT..  will avoid @C lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is much better on W than on E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither pair plays a form of Namyats to differentiate good vs random 4M openers|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H = no major, 3@S = transfer to 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: when S gets the lead later and leads a @D, decl should either duck or put up the K|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, all it needs is the @d finesse and break, or lots of good things|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks guys|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting that neither pair has a tool to show a real 4H|pg||
nt|dinos1: thx all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Restart is at 20:00 local time so that's in 2hours from now|pg||
nt|dinos1: no 2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry Al didn´´t see you|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not crazy about the opening bid with only 4 losers -- maybe would have bid differently if @S instead of @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thanks and bye|pg||
nt|po-s: of course if you use Namyats partner never has what it takes anyway|pg||
