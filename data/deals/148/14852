mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all - The EW-team, Jacobs are seedet 7. in Springgold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, NS missed the boat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: cayne is the  4 seed, and this is the second closest match at the half|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open Beatty-Jacobs are NS - the 3. pair on the team are Bocchi-ferraro, Italy|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund, Bill Frisby and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it was a bad idea to pre-empt with west's very balanced hand - it might push opps into a making 4@S they weren't going to bid on their own|pg||
nt|dima:  So some action with a Polish club I suppose on the board N1|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure south will feel able to bid that 5-card suit yet again :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Well Apolinary might guess that partner is short in @h, but how many @s will he have?|pg||
nt|dima:  Certainly not 3 (would raise) ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with all suit almost 3-3, only a @s-lead can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|dima:  Actually 4@h bid now as DO SMTH clever could be ok :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores for half time scores|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|athene: yes, you can often use a cue-bid as a choice of games bid in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|dima:  Discipline won|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dima:  And it is clear even if undiscussed since 3@s was nonforcing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dima:  Well looks like first blood to Jacobs (4 IMPs)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: perhaps south should just have passed 3@H out - his partner, known to be short in hearts, didn't act over 3@H, so must be very weak|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: not easy though with three small facing the assumed singleton|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if he'd been IN 6 times that wouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a diamond exit you discard club from dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @D brings @H9 into play|pg||

nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This should be fun for me, I have played with Mike Passell and Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Welcome everyone |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am currently writing a book with Boye Brogeland, so I hope for some great hand in this set that we can use in the book.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  They are both marvelous players, that make you feel like you are relaxing in a rocking chair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not if you are playing against them!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome also to Frank Budai, Australia   (rejoining us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh they changed names,  skip previous comment |pg||
nt|casenjo:  transfer to clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@S is a transfer to clubs and South will have two possible responses: 2NT and 3@C. 2NT would indicate a good fit for clubs.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|casenjo:  Yes, 'in between pre accepts'|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin should make this, he does not need to guess @ds when @cs split that way|pg||
nt|sybarra: the club players I was talking about are in the other room  but we have a great room!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks, to leave West with an awkward comtinuation.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  And Boye has his work cut out for him on hand  1|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm all|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Hello, henry!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: but he has a trump control problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @H from Jeff or a spade? |pg||
nt|ritong: so, if aker plays a @h back, south might consider pitching a @c|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: East's @S3 was a discouraging signal, warning West not to continue spades (into the lion's jaw - South's A-J).|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  of all the continuations that was probably the worst|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: re-morning Frank |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/     let's you keep a realtime eye on the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dima:  looks like rather easy 3NT for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi all, not so easy on a club lead|pg||
nt|dima:  Very tough to find even against polish club|pg||
nt|pelu: EIGHT mARTIN - A @C-LEAD WILL DEFEAT - BUT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the suit has really never been bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: current scores at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the horrible breaks make this unlikely to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: east's rebid highlights something that few if any club players seem to discuss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 2/1, what does opener need to make a "high level reverse"   i.e. bid 3 of new suit, without jump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some say always 5 of 2nd suit, some always extras, some require both, some require neither|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: sorry Caps lock :(:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than that -- it is pretty standard :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: there are many copies of WBF CC for Lauria-Versace online -- check ecatsbridge.com under either the latest European Championship or the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|dima:  But declarer still have some loosing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=max, 4@H   3@D=retransfer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ouch|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  this makes 7 Hearts with everything breaking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does anybody know EW system|pg||
nt|warrens:  take 2 @H ruffs in the W hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|irwinbo: they should get there now|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I meant 2 @D ruffs :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume 1H showed spades, but the rest is a mystery|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undoubtedly every bid so far an alert|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: oh no|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c2|nt|dima:  oops|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: i love it. first non alert was 7@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the other room will also be plagued by this misfit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both majors probably need to break, so this is only around 55% contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  I got disconnected, but this slam is not too bad a % because you have the spots in spades and hearts, but not much better than 50%, which is not enough for 980 vs. 1510 or -50.  +11 or -14 imps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: he found the loosing line :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing for a third club trick isn't bad odds with that suit, a priori|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  I suspect he was afraid of 5-3 diamonds or the overcaller having both high hearts|pg||
nt|dima:  this would win on any 3-3 or H singleton or doubleton by West|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 break or catching a doubleton club honour with west|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: playing hearts towards the @HQJ works better of course but declarer might be thinking west is very likely to hold @HAK since he hasn't got much of a spade suit|pg||
nt|dima:  If @d are 5-3 then heart honor position is not relevant, no?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: excellent point from a few specs --  maybe Versace isn't worth game force 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 1@S-1nt-2@D-3@C all pass for the pessimists|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, diamonds 5-3 is another reason to play clubs instead|pg||
nt|henryb:  correct; so this might well look like the most promising line on the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but science and 66 hands don't really mix well|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|mc|9|pg||

nt|ritong: well giorgio recovered|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a gentle start to the session.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  A friendly start for the Strul team|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Norwegian pair is incredibly aggressive when looking for slams. Most people would regard them as over-aggressive in that area.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|frankaus: fasinating collection here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  indeed |pg||
nt|ritong: he had some idea about @s Q location, since east did not cue|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North has passed. If he were to bid, he would have used transfers over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  A possible game for E-W, and no safe harbor for N-S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|brolucius: 5@C is a lucky make, needing two good things to happen.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or should I say "yuck" |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|ritong: the good old reversed two suiters|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one can double 3NT but it sure is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|frankaus: play missfits in 3NT is a common view|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may be considering 3NT. No, he has bid just 3@D.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed; but passing 3@d by E is not appreciating how good her hand is|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was an unsuccessful bidding board for East-West. They can make 10 or 11 tricks in their best fit but have sold out to 3@D. |pg||
nt|henryb:  She was close (imo) between 2@c and 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|dima:  Would X over 3@d be to compete some place or penalty? |pg||
nt|po-s: About an ace more than she might have had|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had two great cards for partner and had made only a forced 2@C bid.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: each player would rather have another pard,  if they could see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With clubs 3-2 it has *some* play, but this is awful|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to duck the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy |pg||
nt|frankaus: duboin did well to stay out of the action|pg||
nt|sybarra: your rightie opens you best suit,  easy to stay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: red light helped|pg||
nt|ritong: so this is a matter of number of undertricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as pointed out to me,  then your lefty bids you next best suit,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: how does it feel now?|pg||
nt|ritong: going down less than your counterpart is also a way to win imps ( homer nods)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Neither North nor South liked their spade holdings and took the conservative road|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: here comes a @D most likely |pg||
nt|sybarra: just make the communication a mess |pg||
nt|frankaus: u look at dummy u look at ur hand and still cant find even 6 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 of @D or club?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might hope for the clubs to break - I am not sure that Aker is contemplating suicide at this point|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: @S look probable|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi David |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: The good news for Aker is that he won't go 4 down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  This is the sort of hand that makes one appreciate the difficulty of playing with less experienced partners|pg||
nt|dima:  He surely ruffed middle|pg||

nt|fabsayc: actually they play a pretty simple system relative to other top level players|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dima:  So without doing much wrong Markowicz teams looks at substantial deficit after 2 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S puts a lot of pressure on east - i certainly wouldn't want to pass this out with his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: 5@H looks the normal action|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Money for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: as Martin posted earlier -- halftime scores for Spingold online at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: has nothing to do with it|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and indeed we have beaten this to death,   |pg||

nt|fabsayc: including team rosters, check yesterday results for todays spingold matchups|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet a lot of people will be examining the hand after the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, he would be unlikely to play south for @SAK and a side ace as well, i guess|pg||
mb|3N|an|6+ good !S|nt|fabsayc: todays scores at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Especially seeing @c Q coming down so it is not even close to a guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt likely to make here, but a million losers in the 6-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: need good methods here to avoid 4@S|pg||
mc|10|nt|pelu: in OR EW stopped in the "impossible" contract: 2NT (in teams)|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 3NT denies 4@h and 3@s|pg||
nt|dima:  So the spotlight is on Tarek Sadek|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see four of them. Where are the other 999,996?|pg||
nt|athene: west will be worried that his hand simply isn't enough help if spades aren't trumps...he doesn't know about his partner's secret weapon (diamond trick source)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still 3@D is a bit sounder, i would be worried about hearts with east hand|pg||
nt|dima:  I believe they play 3NT rebid here as VERY strong suggestion to play|pg||

nt|henryb:  This is actually a fair game (needs a club guess or the heart finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: David, I think four teams are all-american, but there are 43 foreigh players left, and 50 Americans, given some random decisions on Lev, Pepsi,Shivdasani, Fallenius|pg||
nt|dima:  Maybe Saelensminde could ask then? Maybe a bit different standard being nonvulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: I do not have their current convention card. Sometimes they use 2@D as a weak major two-suiter (possibly 4-4) in the first two seats when NV against Vul. In that case the 2@S has a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: wider range than 8-11.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lev and Pepsi are both full time US residents; Fallenius was, but has resumed playing for Sweden|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jaggy, I think has been laying in the US trials and not for India|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: may have stolen this one |pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W play a forcing 1@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A very borderline slam. I wonder if they will take a look at it.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or at least bought it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  In the other room, Strul competed with 4 clubs, over 3 diamonds and South went down in 4 their diamond contract giving 6 more imps to Strul|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: control*|pg||
nt|phil: no need to apologize|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating for an operator when something like this happens. Ryle  1: do not panic. But it's easier said than done|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Rather than linked up to the router, Jan has used her mobile usb internet|pg||
nt|phil: hopefully she has an unlimited data plan :)|pg||
nt|iceking: Will Strul upgrade this east hand to 2nt opening maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: this is rather long break |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Becker/Strul went out the main exit for a bathroom break, Balicki-Zmudzinski went out the other exit for a smoke break lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Ok they're back now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They should have taken it while we were down :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/BalickiZmudzinski.pdf|pg||
nt|iceking: yes why didnt they do that Roland:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: cc for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: much closer match than was on vugraph earlier today|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I don't see one imp|pg||
mb|1C|nt|casenjo:  I expected that when the director was called, but like I said, once 2 spades has been bid they are in game, the question north has to decide is where|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|iceking: interesting Balicki didnt dbl 1sp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pretty straightforward 3NT. Cards quite friendly|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|phil: any votes for an upgrade with the E hand? |pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt looks correct here not big fan of 2diamonds|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a slam killer if you belong in a minor slam|pg||
mb|2H|an|art, could be weak|nt|hedyg: why Magnus? you never play minor slams?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: nice stop - but 2@s also making|pg||
nt|athene: quite an easy spot here - declarer just has to make sure he doesn't play lots of trumps and leave himself with club losers|pg||
nt|dima:  Egyptians will do well to go plus on this hand - all games to are probably down|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al can you give Wagner again (womens)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  If I am on the committee, it is a f rivolous appeal (and I like Versace and Lauria)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another big @C -- and again we don't know what 2N opening is, so range of rebid will be in question again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/02/wagar/|pg||
nt|caitlin: wagar!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit -- i don't know any big club system that responds 2@C with south hand :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: we saw it eaelier|pg||
nt|caitlin: earlier|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a version of the meckwell switched responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it explained or just seen?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  This has turned into a very cool auction, because if they end up in spades North's king of hearts is protected and that is their only weakness|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So, North can play 6 spades or 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D must be the ferraro convention :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: playing a strong club people often use various 2-level bids to show minor-suit hands, otherwise the 1@D opener just gets too overloaded - it can end up being almost anything|pg||
nt|iceking: iam not sure you need to upgrade this east hand but i would have probably done it anyway|pg||
nt|phil: I like the 5 clubs, but the doubleton majors are a turnoff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see any reason to mastermind and rebid 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If we belong in notrumps, we will get there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: this is easy on the layout, makes 6, but ....|pg||
nt|caitlin: where did Wagar name come from?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d is forcing, NT is not running away|pg||
nt|phil: but if we belong in NT, it should be played from this this side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As happened|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|casenjo:  It is VERY unfair when we see all of the cards, but switch EW and you want to declare every day|pg||
nt|casenjo:  you want NORTH to declare every day...sorry type too fast|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even here, lauria must find heart lead |pg||
nt|phil: and we still might find diamonds after 2N...|pg||
nt|iceking: not really masterminding Roland bid 2nt instead of 2d |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: actually makes only five|pg||
pc|sT|nt|casenjo:  they now have 15 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sementa in 6N after opening 2@C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: the issue for declarer on hands of this sort is whether to go all-out for your ruffs, or alternatively try and set up some side suits and leave the ruffing value in dummy as a ...|pg||
nt|athene: stopper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could finesse here to assure scoring both spades|pg||
nt|dburn: not the same place as Wagner, certainly|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and sementa will pick up a valuable imp|pg||
nt|caitlin: I donèt think it is masterminding;there are times we open 1NT w 2 douubletons. But I concede that NT is so often a minor suit slam killer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: she was a superstar back in 50s i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: east would be protecting his heart holding |pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably 5+,4+ but i am just guessing, have never seen it before|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: margaret|pg||

nt|sybarra: so where do you start the bidding with N?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C I presume|pg||

nt|casenjo:  You are bold, I'm rarely tempted to predict|pg||

nt|brolucius: I see I have made one of my famous incorrect comments. 1@C was not natural and 1@H is part of their system responses.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course some Big Clubbers use 2N opening as artificial, so 1@C covers ALL hands with  16+ HCP|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Many of the top players truly shine, and rise to the occassion with an audience|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the normal lead against this auction is a trump, but south may be hoping that his partner can overruf hearts anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Andy, great info! i was just wondering |pg||

nt|ahollan1: actually  i think Truscott was already in the US when he did write-up of Bobby Jordan's convention -- but i've been told that Albert Dormer might have also invented the convention|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Everything's well now. Scoreline correct|pg||
nt|casenjo:  3NT is a much easier contract than 4Hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: On hand 8, where North made 400 here. They went one down in 2NT (as you would expect) at the other table, for a 10 IMP swing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but 4@sX might be even better|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  looking for action?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: 3nt should be slam interest |pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if the 6-1 diamond break will help declarer in the play. Even if a diamond is led, declarer can play a spade at some stage and West will have no further diamond to play.|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ??|pg||
mb|5D|nt|iceking: 4h well thought out bid Becker knows pd has 1 spade only so might have some heart length |pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: the reason is maybe that opening 1nt confers more of a tactical advantage than overcalling 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the italian pairs we see on vugraph use a lot of DBL to show extras - regardless of shape   so it is unclear if that is what Versace is doing or if his is a form of takeout|pg||

nt|fabsayc: oh well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the other room is playing 6 hearts on a heart lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: Markowitz-Klokowski could't stop in 3@d - they are in 4@s on board 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north is aggresive, south is not, seems to be working ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H aggresive, will be a little lucky to survive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that auction is why inventors have come up with conventions like   Cole, Bart, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: this will be the sixth contract in a row that bocchi has gone down in|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: and  of course  Big Club|pg||
nt|iceking: duck club can be right if pd has stiff king true so maybe possible|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dima:  Why should 1@s all pass be so bad?|pg||
nt|athene: that's about his quota for a year, normally|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well none were makeable|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: yes, mostly they were pretty horrible spots :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: well, in the old days they invented passing over 1@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this room south had the clue needed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North has shown a distributional hand on the bidding, so East has a lot to think about|pg||
nt|casenjo:  we know that North is not as distributional as he thinks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: and it is not entirely clear that they were wrong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: who gets credit for that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that was PASS only in Auction Bridge|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: when you already have 2 tricks you want to take that risk?|pg||
mc|10|nt|po-s: but then a ruff perhaps - trumps were not drawn|pg||
nt|iceking: the risk though led 5d makes so i dont really get it |pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to be an expert to think that deep, Magnús. It would never happen to Mr Jónsson in the local club at Keflavík|pg||
nt|caitlin: it was duck to @CK allowing 5@D to make|pg||
pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would not help West much to duck the @SA. Declarer could win and later throw a loser on the @SQ, conceding a spade trick and setting up the @SJ for a further discard. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  Probably would hold it to 4, but not beat the contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Some would double on the West hand, hoping to survive a removal if partner responded in clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Something like 4@C may be a fit jump now. But they could play it as a splinter. More likely. |pg||
nt|henryb:  depends whether a conversion to @d would show extra values. Sharp division of opinion on so called "equal level conversion"|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like to show clubs as well as diamonds, rather than name a shortage.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|sybarra: another "fun" hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: making 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe you could make a slam if you were in it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are hoping to show two matches from tomorrow and onwards, but it depends on operator availability|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland could |pg||
nt|ritong: aker will not like this holding in @c shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: @d singleton is not yummy either|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a good hand apart from that - 4@c something of an overbid, but...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 4@H denies shortage he had no choice. It's too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|ritong: on the bright side, the ninth trump and relatively solid suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another case of DOIGB|pg||
nt|henryb:  Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Nothing much wrong with 5@D. It is a gamble but it might cause South a problem if he had a good hand.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Of course 4@s would have been better bridge: down 2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  should Boye overtake and try to cash|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, East has not bought well, because partner is short in her second suit. That is why a fit-jump can work well, allowing partner to judge the fit.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm not sure East is strong enough for a fit-jump|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a free bid of 3 clubs, followed by supporting diamonds could excite west when they do have a double fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if 4@C would be a splinter, you could try 3@C.|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might have to do that at the five level|pg||
nt|casenjo:  and keep them out of trouble when they don't have the double fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @d support, I mean|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East been a passed hand, most players would say that 3@C did show a diamond fit as well.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i do|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 'support non-jump' some call it.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: 4@S kickback?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Confirmed|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok Roland make this for us !|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: East says 4@C is splinter with a good hand like 20 in hcp (?)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy to make with all cards in view|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure |pg||
nt|ritong: he will think for a while|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the never are for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: (btw, I put this hand down and say "always the challenge by me pard,  gl"|pg||
nt|ritong: "natural" approach of the @ds is to ruff one, in case of drop, then decideif north follows to the third round|pg||
nt|ritong: which would not be the case|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is an other detail to cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It would be a different ballgame on a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the losing @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still, declarer has a couple of options|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Closed Room is also in 6@H on a club lead from South|pg||
nt|ritong: @c lead is more friendly|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: I am asked what Kickback is. To save space, some use a cheaper bid (4@S here) to ask for aces. It can be particularly important if a minor has been agreed when you can't afford a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: response above the trump suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  no pre-nup?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb:  woops|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: probably the most effecient explanation i have seen Roland,  thx |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strul went down in 3NT on the deal that I predicted would be boringly flat in 3NT. That is a high price to pay, just to make me look stupid. |pg||

nt|athene: maybe north should have done more than just 3@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not over my feather overcalls|pg||
nt|iceking: dont be so sure Roland:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: i love hands where you never pull trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so i guess depends on lower limit for overcall|pg||
nt|caitlin: can you really pass 1@S with 2 spades and a suit with AQ fifth |pg||
nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  don't we all|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6 on with a likely guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except in NT|pg||
nt|iceking: everyone makes a error and this looks like a error from Boye |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dima:  depends a bit on the style of partnership :)|pg||
nt|athene: balanced 9 count responds 1nt to a 1@S overcall doesn't it?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard for NS to cash their four tricks if EW reach 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I rate him as one of the best players in the world. I am sure you do too|pg||
nt|iceking: will smuz bid 6d here or 5d its close |pg||
nt|hedyg: he might put it into David's book...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: a ruling was made changing board 23 to 3H making 4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: no passes here|pg||
nt|iceking: oh he passed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: an auction without passes is not an auction|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: usually pd has some values for bidding game when you protect with dbl so i just dont understand how he can stop here |pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought 8 card suits are trump?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dima:  I would say so :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: ferraro expecting extras for 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand - even facing a minimum opener it might come home|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because his partner a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: this is a situation where south might think about showing three hearts so his partner doesn't try for a trump promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trumps promotion would require an unlikely J10x in south in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and still would not suffice unless south had club ace|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe he could have bal with just 5d instead of dbl |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Duboin stopped in 2@S on 43|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have missed better slams|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Balicki said something to Zmudzinski (in Polish), Becker: "I had taken some Polish lessons from high school at night, so be careful what you say"|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: yes we all have |pg||
nt|hedyg: something like " when did you plan to bid your suit?"|pg||
nt|caitlin: This is a well oiled partnership and perhaps N has a way to show stronger hand than bidding game directly.|pg||
nt|iceking: Boye bid the hand more normal in closed room his 5d was though rather convervative pd might though have had hand like qxxx kqxxx x kxxx ofcourse so its a risk gambling on slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 times @H now is ok as the cards lie, but.......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't risk losing to Qxx with West|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cannot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is easier to play than 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe he can afford to lose to West's possible Qxx. @S9 stops the suit|pg||
nt|iceking: Balick is in a nasty spot now|pg||
nt|hedyg: alllllll specs asking him to play 2 top @hs and then @H pitching @s|pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will just play 3 rounds of hearts looks correct |pg||
nt|dburn: he may be concerned that East has @hQxxx|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: what id @hs are 4-1 and E plays @C?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|dima:  Over 2@c North could maybe try 2@d followed by 3@c or something of this sort|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s7|nt|athene: north might be wondering whether to switch to a club - i.e. cash @CA, then back to @HK and another heart for trump promo|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he will play to the jack|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Aker had to work hard here, well done to him|pg||
mb|2S|nt|casenjo:  I'm too pedestrian, I would have overtaken trick one and tried to cash my aces :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: South went to bed with the @CA...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: spade over call   |pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a good idea with almost 2000 kibs and several commentators sitting like vultures on a branch, watching your every move.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might try 5@D?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  a player messaged me "a 6D PUNT!?"|pg||
nt|brolucius: A tricky bid, anyway.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I answered: this would be the hand for it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think I would bid 3@s, then 5@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: If he bids 5@D, North will bid 6@D. A vulnerable 5@D bid deserves respect and they HATE missing a slam.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|sybarra: disciplined jeff |pg||
nt|casenjo:  that jump might be enough to turn Boye on|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If North bids 4@h, South will almost surely try 6@d|pg||
nt|reisig: 16 X 4 = 64|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i'm with you henry, but Boye thought otherwise|pg||
nt|brolucius: 50-50 now that North will add a sixth diamond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I too am often wrong|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I still like your bid after the jump to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: now the natural version of gazzilli|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might have long hearts to bid 4@H. 5@D still shows a giant hand via the double.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Now the odds favor playing East for the missing @HQ. That is the Theory of Vacant Places. West has six spades to East's two, so East has more vacant places to hold the @HQ.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Again they try to make me look stupid!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: For some reason the score on 55 was changed so Cayne gained 10 IMPs. The 4@H= next door has been changed to 3@H+1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|ritong: 2@h clarifying|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do they tell difference?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 2 @H  I see |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gazzilli strikes for the second time in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: lauria s overcall with the boss suit makes it a little different|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps it is time for USA to take a look at this!!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And the match is virtually over with this one and after the change on 55|pg||
nt|ritong: i know bart bramley already had a serious look at it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Passell is trying to beat 5D, he would make a differnt lead vs slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: and he certainly has colleagues|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if the clubs were frozen i dont see a way be beat hand, so really think this defense was wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Ornstein didn't know who could make what, but I guess he figured that if his partner didn't have enough aces for him to make 6@s, maybe the opponents did for them to make 6@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the contract in the other room is 5 clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dima:  4 top tricks + Qxx in partner's expected 6-card suit looks really good|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2D|an|denies 3 card !S|nt|athene: north should really know his partner can't be screaming for a diamond, can he? i suppose it's just barely possible that south has a diamond void?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ahh, they play support doubles|pg||
mb|3C|nt|iceking: i would not support clubs here with east hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dima:  Well if you play 4@s there you DO take your time :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: that would give him about 15 clubs|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe its ok though not that bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east close to a 3@H rebid there, but singleton ace isn't so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: PASS probably shows 2@S|pg||

nt|caitlin: tomorrow we will see finals of Wagar (womens teams)..should be very exciting|pg||

mc|9|nt|fabsayc: the oswald jacoby syndrome?|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: quite a bit in the CR |pg||

nt|Walddk4: David will let us know the odds for playing the spade suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|dburn: and without the aid of Gazzilli, the Italians might not reach it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running the queen, David?|pg||
nt|ritong: well, an inference of the gazz is that jumps are a little bit more pure|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no|pg||
nt|dburn: that is what you do with Q10876 facing A9|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|brolucius: 2@D is alerted because they would make a Support Double on all hands containing three-card spade support.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Difficult to judge these hands exactly, but both sides had a nine-card fit in their minor. That suggests around 9 tricks each (or 10 and 8, or 8 and 10). So, on that basis bidding ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4 over 4 was doubtful. Particularly as North had a singleton in South's first-bid suit.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: A rough guide on competitive hands is that you should bid to the level of the total number of trumps that you hold in the partnership. (To the three-level with 9 trumps). That is ...|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure, but there might have been a way to take ten tricks first, so to speak|pg||
nt|iceking: wasnt he down if east had jtxx in hearts and kxx in diamods |pg||
nt|iceking: should have played hearts was 100 % save|pg||
mb|1H|nt|casenjo:  without the score change on board 23, it is a mere 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure how others feel -- but i've really enjoyed watching this set|pg||
mb|1N|an|semi forcing|nt|casenjo:  very good bridge both the 3rd and 4th quarters|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N ostensibly 15-17|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: yes but i dont understand S bids iam starting to think i learned this game totally wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 1@H. Too good for 2@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: i am with Magnus here, not worried re 1@H, worried re pass by S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfg: there was an appeal and directors looked at the board and changed the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: on board 23/55|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: surprising inactivity from west|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: surely he could bid 3@C non-forcing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: some spectators have found a line for Lauria to make, and I trust them|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|pelu: again 12 tricks - this time on 2 finess out of 2 :)|pg||
nt|athene: NS have lots of big cards on this one but no trick source, so it's aggressive to look for slam|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit better than needing two finesses|pg||
nt|dima:  4@s denied slam interest I believe|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: actually maybe not|pg||
nt|hedyg: sticky cards?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|athene: if the spades come in for no losers you can lead towards the @CJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: then you make with the @CQ right or 3-3 clubs or diamond finesse on|pg||
nt|caitlin: doubtful 10 on last hand.....has to give up lead before 10|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: your home if spades 3-2, king onside|pg||
nt|athene: if there is a spade loser you maybe need @CQx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: doubleton king i mean|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead gives extra chances|pg||
nt|athene: there is also the chance of getting a friendly lead like a diamond|pg||
nt|dima:  Yes covering with the 7 will bring smile|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|athene: if south's 2@H bid identified both his suits, then west could probably bid clubs non-forcing but it's harder if 2@H is just spades and a minor|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests they might play Raptor|pg||
nt|hedyg: in that case he cannot bid a natural NT, but he can bid 2@d then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I can certainly bet that they do play the polish 1NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: now what, sort of in wrong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: no fast entry to hand now - why not @SQ?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to get back to hand without disturbing some suit that is better left intact|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he was likely planning to balance with 3@C if given a chance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, with the @S8 in hand you would think declarer could perhaps lead the queen first time|pg||

pc|hT|nt|pelu: @s4 cost 11 IMP :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: east wasn't too hard-pressed to get that right -  it would be very odd play for declarer to lead a small club there without @CJxx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|athene: short of an entry to crossruff; doesn't have trump control to use his diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|ritong: a tough match for cayne s boys|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: To open 2@H on the East hand would not be a good bid. (Two side aces). Mind you, there should not really be a gap between 1@H and 2@H, so I would open 1@H.|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|casenjo:  Balicki made it easy for partner to beat 5 diamonds dbld on Board 12; he led a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's pass tells partner that he has only two spades to fit the suit shown by the transfer response. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: I wonder if Redouble by North would have been a re-transfer?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you cant blame declarer for not thinking sadek might have club singleton|pg||
nt|athene: well, sadek would never lead a singleton if he had the king of trumps|pg||
nt|caitlin: others show it not making,,,|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he could not go down in 3NT - maybe they will play that at the other table|pg||
nt|iceking: been a very interesting set in my opinion alot of cool boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Polish 1NT overcall shows 4-other-major and 5+ in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: If it was an overcall of a minor, it shows 5+other minor and an unknown 4 card Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left at this table|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: he knows opps aren't missing two keycards so his partner can't have an ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it still wouldn't make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i agree JoAnne - both sets we've seen have been well played|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Some people call it the Raptor NT, so the name varies depending on which area of region you are from|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: even if he cashed @CA then ruffed the heart|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: i dont agree william|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N sure looks like artificial raise -- wonder if it guarantees some shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: 2 minutes ago the tournament director came into the room and announced that we are playing into the 2nd quarter time|pg||
nt|iceking: w will pass north bid 2sp and east dbl maybe|pg||

nt|iceking: w needs to bid 2nt here or|pg||
nt|caitlin: will they get to 3N|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: heart was very risky lead|pg||
nt|athene: ok maybe never is strong but he wouldn't automatically lead one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: The next vugraph I think will start as soon as the scores have been compared and checked|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: for you 2N scrambling or natural Magnus? |pg||

pc|c9|nt|iceking: now 1 down |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Becker asking if it's the same leads in the middle of the game, Adam says yes it's the same, so he should have a doubleton because if he had K97 he would switch to a 9|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: if South wins|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: this is their three card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: according to Fred -- the correct play in that @S suit was to lead Q!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: i wonder if south intended 3@D as forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand facing a hand which can double a notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  So last boards of the segments - we have seen very solid bridge by Sadek-Elahmady (as usual one almost want to add)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: strange 3Nt by Kowalski with 4 card @h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pin singleton ten|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  4333 is a percentge for polish players|pg||
nt|athene: he has 4333; it's not a bad shot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hearts dont bother me but the two unstopped suits do|pg||
nt|dima:  Defence tends to miscount/misplace cards|pg||
nt|dima:  Equivalent to 1NT (weak) - 3NT but one might consider positional values ...|pg||
nt|pelu: or he is still a little shaken after the misplay in 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, north perhaps hasn't got a hand which can double a notrump :) but he doubled anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D even if not forcing should show values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Zmudzinski says thank you to the opponents and has left the room|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: is questionable why versace selected the 4-4 fit here, the 6-3 will usually be easier to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: in polish club makes more sense than in standard however|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this looks like a nice defense, but not enough to stop a mere 2 spades|pg||
nt|iceking: not much in this board 10-11 tricks |pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|dima:  that is unlikely - we look at some 50+ years of experience here|pg||

pc|h6|nt|dima:  well 40+ is nearer to the mark, Kowalski has just won European Senior championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless Rigal thought the same way, and did not give Ornstein those spade ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the 3rd of 4 sets  --- with match this close don't be surprised if next set vugraph presentation is same match|pg||
