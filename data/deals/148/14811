nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Goeffrey|pg||
nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: not just this hand but safer any time|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|sharkey: i think most of us wud have ended up in game on this hand - likely to be duplicated OR I think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: It´s always difficult to bid a minor slam on 6-2 and with max 30points|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: good dicard by N = not hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: N denies @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they had a chance here to stay low|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to stay low with East's power house|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but west has screamed weakness with 2@D|pg||
nt|haans: here weak nt was the winner|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|sA|nt|lestergold: evening in Denmark?|pg||

nt|jcwla: 2@D non-GF, on a hideous suit, combined with an indeterminate 2@S and a pass on a dime -- this seemingly cannot be where it's at.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
nt|shevek: guess it was ok both previous hands to open 10 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: as long as pd knows (part of the sys)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i thought tyne one spade opener was a little unbalanced in a different sense|pg||

nt|jcwla: Now lots of points but...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: indeed carl|pg||
nt|haans: long way to slamn here|pg||

mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||

nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||

nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||

nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
pc|cA|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: two way c hook and a missing hearts Q which offside|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S from E|pg||

nt|ralfwil: But W was helpful:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|haans: weak 2?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: cant see why 3nt is not a very easy contract to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: dont blame east for a cheeky third in hand bid at fave vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2S=wk 2 bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: South say NT but North have @D stopper|pg||
nt|haans: :) Until we´ll meet again :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is not to bid game, but to stay out of 6@c missing @dAK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only swing is calling slam|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C asking for que|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i dont think there is any problem - the commentators curse maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@c by S - 4@h by N ans S know they are missing @d control|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C may be rkc|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true or just a 3nt punt works|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreement the rkb is 4@D or 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hagen surely hoped for X|pg||

nt|lestergold: n/s bidding merely a little optim istic south's 3@c reasonable north overval;ued his hand in my view over excioted by the club fit and not giving due regard to his flat shape and ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubtfult values in spades and dims|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|shevek: anyway, as the scoring goes, I start to believe that bd 2 is the odd one out :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but East made a very bad bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: had to hope that n/s had overcooked things which of course they had|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have a simple view when you have a weak hand make one bid with it at the ealiest opportunity and then leave all decsiions to pard|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: let u know in a minuter|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lml: works on this hand|pg||
