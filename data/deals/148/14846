nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund, Bill Frisby and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it was a bad idea to pre-empt with west's very balanced hand - it might push opps into a making 4@S they weren't going to bid on their own|pg||
nt|dima:  So some action with a Polish club I suppose on the board N1|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure south will feel able to bid that 5-card suit yet again :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Well Apolinary might guess that partner is short in @h, but how many @s will he have?|pg||
nt|dima:  Certainly not 3 (would raise) ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with all suit almost 3-3, only a @s-lead can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|dima:  Actually 4@h bid now as DO SMTH clever could be ok :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps south should just have passed 3@H out - his partner, known to be short in hearts, didn't act over 3@H, so must be very weak|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|dima:  oops|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: i love it. first non alert was 7@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: both majors probably need to break, so this is only around 55% contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  I got disconnected, but this slam is not too bad a % because you have the spots in spades and hearts, but not much better than 50%, which is not enough for 980 vs. 1510 or -50.  +11 or -14 imps|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: he found the loosing line :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing for a third club trick isn't bad odds with that suit, a priori|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  I suspect he was afraid of 5-3 diamonds or the overcaller having both high hearts|pg||
nt|dima:  this would win on any 3-3 or H singleton or doubleton by West|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 break or catching a doubleton club honour with west|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|athene: playing hearts towards the @HQJ works better of course but declarer might be thinking west is very likely to hold @HAK since he hasn't got much of a spade suit|pg||
nt|dima:  If @d are 5-3 then heart honor position is not relevant, no?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: actually they play a pretty simple system relative to other top level players|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: as Martin posted earlier -- halftime scores for Spingold online at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that site doesn't have Wagar [Ladies] results and last time i checked neither did the ACBL site|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|athene: north even with a spade fit of course just takes the money|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, you cant steal from bocchi|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|dima:  I think every redblooded bridge player would bid with East hand ... but I've been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3-3-3 hands aren't meant to bid 5 over 5 with, especially when you have all your strength in defensive tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question is really whether 4@s is normal. If not, then this may be a win for Markowitz|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: so looks like 800 +50 for Jacobs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dima:  4@s does look a bit offbeat to me with 7222|pg||
nt|athene: i like 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: often good to pretend to be weak defensively when you are not|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience when one table opens 1major and the other opens 4, the one who opened high almost always gains|pg||
nt|pelu: green against red - OK for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Markowicz is back in the match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls i check in the dark when partner opens 4@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: north's correct action over 4@S is not just to pass, but to pass instantly, looking bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S = 7 playing tricks - thats almost the S-hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same as check in the dark :)|pg||
nt|po-s: agree - AK of hearts to deal with Jxxx with North - not played to best advantage|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|caitlin: Hi folks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Klukowski was surprisingly passive at the other table: overcalled 3@h and then passed throughout|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm that's a strange switch, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has got busy for no reason however|pg||
nt|athene: why not just cash your hearts and exit a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash hearts, exit spades was the indicated defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be right, we agree|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was playing his partner for a singleton or void diamond|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 3nt likely to make here, but a million losers in the 6-2 spade fit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: need good methods here to avoid 4@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: in OR EW stopped in the "impossible" contract: 2NT (in teams)|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 3NT denies 4@h and 3@s|pg||
nt|dima:  So the spotlight is on Tarek Sadek|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see four of them. Where are the other 999,996?|pg||
nt|athene: west will be worried that his hand simply isn't enough help if spades aren't trumps...he doesn't know about his partner's secret weapon (diamond trick source)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still 3@D is a bit sounder, i would be worried about hearts with east hand|pg||
nt|dima:  I believe they play 3NT rebid here as VERY strong suggestion to play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was that a smooth duck|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: it helps to leave partner room to bid his hand, and that is another reason for 3@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: most people play 1x - 1y; 3NT as long solid or nearly solid suit with some stoppers|pg||
nt|pelu: some wopuldbid 3Nt here: = strong hand with long @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Not the first time I was wrong :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was sort of half-way between that and a "proper" 2nt bid|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now back to @S?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dima:  Some scoring :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: good lead, but wont stop this conservative contract|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW signals, when given honestly, are udca  with odd/even discard|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: i think West in the other room took a very odd view to pass 2nt - it's unlikely to be the right spot when you have that hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he didn't have the methods to stop in 3@S, which he might have wanted to do|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT is a bid - not a contract :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: conversely 3NT is a contract, not a bid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|athene: i think most people are more happy to open 1nt with a 5-card major rather than overcall it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: the reason is maybe that opening 1nt confers more of a tactical advantage than overcalling 1nt|pg||

mb|6H|nt|casenjo:  I would find it tough to want to defend with North's hand, poor soul, glad it isn't me|pg||
nt|frankaus: e/w will X 6 @S to show no @S control|pg||
nt|sybarra: and either E or W, so you know where the q of @D is? |pg||
nt|tempid: 6@h isn't cold.  After n shows out of @hs, is he sure to have short @ds on the auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sementa may be thinking if he bids 6@S that may give E-W a forcing pass and help them bid a grand (if there is one)|pg||

nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand - even facing a minimum opener it might come home|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because his partner a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: this is a situation where south might think about showing three hearts so his partner doesn't try for a trump promotion|pg||

nt|fabsayc: if the clubs were frozen i dont see a way be beat hand, so really think this defense was wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Ornstein didn't know who could make what, but I guess he figured that if his partner didn't have enough aces for him to make 6@s, maybe the opponents did for them to make 6@h|pg||

nt|sybarra: well they play a club system,  so may not have promised much more that 5 @Hs and some stuff|pg||
nt|tempid: Well, *at least* 1 imp will change hands here.|pg||
nt|dburn: more than that, I guess - I don't see how declarer can make this|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David :)  welcome |pg||
nt|tempid: I don't see how, but again, I don't declare like these guys.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|tempid: Not that unusual that one of the really good declarers makes a hand single dummy that I can't make double dummy.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you cant blame declarer for not thinking sadek might have club singleton|pg||
nt|athene: well, sadek would never lead a singleton if he had the king of trumps|pg||
nt|caitlin: others show it not making,,,|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he could not go down in 3NT - maybe they will play that at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: he knows opps aren't missing two keycards so his partner can't have an ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it still wouldn't make|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: even if he cashed @CA then ruffed the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont agree william|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: east gets his @S6 one way or another|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Last board of the segment now|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: thx especially to our terrific operator Andy Hung,    @HH!@H |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to my co commentators all |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: With the match being a bit close I think the same match will be broadcasted for the final segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: but the special thanks goes to Jan Martel, coordinator for the BBO vugraph,  and to ACBL |pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we wil close for their comparisons |pg||
nt|sybarra: usually takes about 15 -20 min or so for the  break |pg||
mb|3N|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: The next segment will start in approximately 20minutes I think|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: time enough for them to compare, get refreshed, decide on line ups etc etc etc |pg||
nt|dburn: the margin may be greater after this, mind you|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: like 17|pg||

pc|sK|nt|dburn: 4@h at the other table could have been beaten (after a diamond lead ducked to the king) but wasn't (after a low spade shift)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|an|spade support|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is their three card raise|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|an|4 Hearts 10 - 11|mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder if south intended 3@D as forcing?|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty good hand facing a hand which can double a notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  So last boards of the segments - we have seen very solid bridge by Sadek-Elahmady (as usual one almost want to add)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: strange 3Nt by Kowalski with 4 card @h?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|dima:  4333 is a percentge for polish players|pg||
nt|athene: he has 4333; it's not a bad shot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hearts dont bother me but the two unstopped suits do|pg||
nt|dima:  Defence tends to miscount/misplace cards|pg||
nt|dima:  Equivalent to 1NT (weak) - 3NT but one might consider positional values ...|pg||
nt|pelu: or he is still a little shaken after the misplay in 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, north perhaps hasn't got a hand which can double a notrump :) but he doubled anyway|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: 3@D even if not forcing should show values|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is questionable why versace selected the 4-4 fit here, the 6-3 will usually be easier to play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: in polish club makes more sense than in standard however|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dima:  that is unlikely - we look at some 50+ years of experience here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: i guess 3@D is reasonable enough|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to mention the spade ruffs in heart contract|pg||

nt|athene: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to everybody, especially our operator|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and lots of good comments from spectators|pg||
mc|10|nt|dima:  well 40+ is nearer to the mark, Kowalski has just won European Senior championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless Rigal thought the same way, and did not give Ornstein those spade ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the 3rd of 4 sets  --- with match this close don't be surprised if next set vugraph presentation is same match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S doubled down 1 at other table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the J109xx in trumps hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are waiting for other table to finish, good time to wash the dog|pg||
