nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open Beatty-Jacobs are NS - the 3. pair on the team are Bocchi-ferraro, Italy|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund, Bill Frisby and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it was a bad idea to pre-empt with west's very balanced hand - it might push opps into a making 4@S they weren't going to bid on their own|pg||
nt|dima:  So some action with a Polish club I suppose on the board N1|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure south will feel able to bid that 5-card suit yet again :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Well Apolinary might guess that partner is short in @h, but how many @s will he have?|pg||
nt|dima:  Certainly not 3 (would raise) ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with all suit almost 3-3, only a @s-lead can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|dima:  Actually 4@h bid now as DO SMTH clever could be ok :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|athene: yes, you can often use a cue-bid as a choice of games bid in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|dima:  Discipline won|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dima:  And it is clear even if undiscussed since 3@s was nonforcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dima:  Well looks like first blood to Jacobs (4 IMPs)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|athene: perhaps south should just have passed 3@H out - his partner, known to be short in hearts, didn't act over 3@H, so must be very weak|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dima:  But declarer still have some loosing options|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  this makes 7 Hearts with everything breaking|pg||

nt|warrens:  take 2 @H ruffs in the W hand|pg||
mb|6D|an|void in diamonds|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: they should get there now|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I meant 2 @D ruffs :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i assume 1H showed spades, but the rest is a mystery|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undoubtedly every bid so far an alert|pg||
mb|7H|nt|pelu: oh no|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i love it. first non alert was 7@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: both majors probably need to break, so this is only around 55% contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  I got disconnected, but this slam is not too bad a % because you have the spots in spades and hearts, but not much better than 50%, which is not enough for 980 vs. 1510 or -50.  +11 or -14 imps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: he found the loosing line :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing for a third club trick isn't bad odds with that suit, a priori|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  I suspect he was afraid of 5-3 diamonds or the overcaller having both high hearts|pg||
nt|dima:  this would win on any 3-3 or H singleton or doubleton by West|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 break or catching a doubleton club honour with west|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: playing hearts towards the @HQJ works better of course but declarer might be thinking west is very likely to hold @HAK since he hasn't got much of a spade suit|pg||
nt|dima:  If @d are 5-3 then heart honor position is not relevant, no?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|athene: yes, diamonds 5-3 is another reason to play clubs instead|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dima:  So without doing much wrong Markowicz teams looks at substantial deficit after 2 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S puts a lot of pressure on east - i certainly wouldn't want to pass this out with his hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@H looks the normal action|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Money for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|athene: north even with a spade fit of course just takes the money|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: wow, you cant steal from bocchi|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dima:  I think every redblooded bridge player would bid with East hand ... but I've been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3-3-3 hands aren't meant to bid 5 over 5 with, especially when you have all your strength in defensive tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question is really whether 4@s is normal. If not, then this may be a win for Markowitz|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|pelu: so looks like 800 +50 for Jacobs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dima:  4@s does look a bit offbeat to me with 7222|pg||
nt|athene: i like 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: often good to pretend to be weak defensively when you are not|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience when one table opens 1major and the other opens 4, the one who opened high almost always gains|pg||
nt|pelu: green against red - OK for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Markowicz is back in the match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls i check in the dark when partner opens 4@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: north's correct action over 4@S is not just to pass, but to pass instantly, looking bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S = 7 playing tricks - thats almost the S-hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same as check in the dark :)|pg||
nt|po-s: agree - AK of hearts to deal with Jxxx with North - not played to best advantage|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Klukowski was surprisingly passive at the other table: overcalled 3@h and then passed throughout|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm that's a strange switch, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has got busy for no reason however|pg||
nt|athene: why not just cash your hearts and exit a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash hearts, exit spades was the indicated defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be right, we agree|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was playing his partner for a singleton or void diamond|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: yes, he would be unlikely to play south for @SAK and a side ace as well, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: todays scores at http://www.bridgewinners.com/2010-spingold-scores|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dima:  Especially seeing @c Q coming down so it is not even close to a guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt likely to make here, but a million losers in the 6-2 spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: need good methods here to avoid 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: in OR EW stopped in the "impossible" contract: 2NT (in teams)|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 3NT denies 4@h and 3@s|pg||
nt|dima:  So the spotlight is on Tarek Sadek|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see four of them. Where are the other 999,996?|pg||
nt|athene: west will be worried that his hand simply isn't enough help if spades aren't trumps...he doesn't know about his partner's secret weapon (diamond trick source)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still 3@D is a bit sounder, i would be worried about hearts with east hand|pg||
nt|dima:  I believe they play 3NT rebid here as VERY strong suggestion to play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: it helps to leave partner room to bid his hand, and that is another reason for 3@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: most people play 1x - 1y; 3NT as long solid or nearly solid suit with some stoppers|pg||
nt|pelu: some wopuldbid 3Nt here: = strong hand with long @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Not the first time I was wrong :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: good lead, but wont stop this conservative contract|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|c9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|athene: i think West in the other room took a very odd view to pass 2nt - it's unlikely to be the right spot when you have that hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he didn't have the methods to stop in 3@S, which he might have wanted to do|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT is a bid - not a contract :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c2|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: he was likely planning to balance with 3@C if given a chance|pg||

nt|athene: he has 4333; it's not a bad shot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hearts dont bother me but the two unstopped suits do|pg||
nt|dima:  Defence tends to miscount/misplace cards|pg||
nt|dima:  Equivalent to 1NT (weak) - 3NT but one might consider positional values ...|pg||
nt|pelu: or he is still a little shaken after the misplay in 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, north perhaps hasn't got a hand which can double a notrump :) but he doubled anyway|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: 3@D even if not forcing should show values|pg||
