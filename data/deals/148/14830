nt|mamos:  hi Frank|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|ady: gramd to start|pg||
nt|haans: good start a slam|pg||
nt|ady: on the K@H    should be in small slam|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|ady: 4@S  e/w can be defeated by diamond lead and 4 rounds of diamonds  giving a trump promotion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hei Hans:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Jakarta in Indonesia. Round-robin finals among 8 teams, 7 matches of 14 boards over two days. This is the second|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: Selamat pagi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello David and Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Paulus too brave for bid 3nt|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mamos:  misfit|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: yes but a sound contract.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: look like 3nt -1 from 4@D and 1@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.gabrial-ui.com/|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT e/w makes on guessing the spade position     |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards for the contract but 4@H imo a better contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  some communication issues|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 4th suit GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: I prefer 3@S after 4thsuit with such quality spades   also conveys shortage in diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Can't see any cards then the played. Will go out and come back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re all. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpm: thinking..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: if they err into grand will come out smelling of roses|pg||
nt|ady: the double fit makes the play simple|pg||
nt|haans: but what suit is trumf|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: if not leading a heart  thenQ@C seems the more natural lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: But on after that lead.|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes odd to lead Ace v NT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: good evening from Toronto|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: of course West is actually Gordon from Canada|pg||
nt|lml: this is a four man team and even though they are tired they didnt have time to fly anybody in |pg||
nt|garnetts: This will will not make  North happy--but Most likely 4@S will go down |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||
nt|lml: I believe Balcombe and Taylor have been in every set of the whole event as well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: New @H? Nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: Free for a @S hook and @D play now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if a new @H came?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 3NT always is flat. Even by the best lead. @C.|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pace so far.|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that would be the normal way to do it in Indonesia|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Pass - Pass - Pass - and silalahi will bid ??|pg||
nt|josj: yesterday and this morning all teams played a Swiss for 7 rounds; the top 8 qualify for a round robin that finishes tomorrow afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS turn for 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Whatever that 2@S means its not my idea of a weak bid --too much defence |pg||
nt|ady: spades 2-2   so 4@S on for n/s|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mamos:  hello|pg||
nt|haans: not that clear what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A slightly heavy 4@S does the trick here of keeping @H's out of the picture.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And 100 is cheap against 620|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 150 sorry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Rolanbd :)|pg||
nt|josj: Roland|pg||
nt|josj: sry|pg||
nt|ady: best lead is a club   but defence then will get 2 clubs and a diamond    heart loser goiing on the diamonds    if a heart is led  then 11 tricks   both clubs go away on the ...|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  unlikely to make  even guessing well in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid imo.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont know their system, precision or standard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard cards it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As to play?|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos:  certainly to play  expect itt  to be bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|don_kapu: normal lead @Sor @H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|mamos:  misunderstanding?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as that moysany ain't gona work. Next.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: Requires some play to make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't think N/S will usu be left to play quietly in 4@H; the comparison may be between 150 and 500.|pg||
nt|haans: we all have missed better games|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT  n/s   an unlikely contract  though would make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Jones Karwur according to the profile|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@D probably the Muiderberg style, 5Major and 4 + minor|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mamos:  we'll see : )|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play club now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|mamos:  I think club players would bid 3NT  not sure that would work either|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S made the trial bid of 2@S looking for a check and N took it natural.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Did S have max for his NT bid? (12-14)?|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now an easy grand slam to *play*, but to bid .....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to think really big thoughts.  |pg||
nt|ady: if this is bif in OR   will lose imps  that was likely gained on first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 4@H   by west through a transfer|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
nt|josj: the EW hands fit the EW team's name very well: May Good Things Happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were 25th before the last qualifying round and still got through!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.inabridge.com/|pg||
nt|josj: that's 1 good thing already, then :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Martha Stewart says, it's a good thing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: played by east 4@H goes down on a club lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D must be the lightest overcall this century|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West passed??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this auction, back to bed|pg||
nt|josj: if 2@C is Precision, that pass is a real surprise|pg||
nt|josj: East will certainly bid on...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is going on?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: opening with a flat 11 count becoming more prevalent|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT was a little joke|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is and they still get to non making games--combined 23 counts--which even the world's best card players cannot make |pg||
nt|don_kapu: depend how to manage not loose 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also makes |pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
nt|jcwla: When you think of the hands that a precision 2@C could be bid on, W cannot possibly think has described this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is a joke|pg||
nt|jcwla: How do you really feel, Roland? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is but if Precision the hand is way too good for it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear 1@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  bets on 3@H?|pg||
nt|josj: I bet it was Precision (but not quite...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like playing grand slams in game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, this does not bode well for MGTH -- a little bit of almost humorous interference and they've stopped a level short of what we could have expected and two levels short of what ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: we might have hoped.|pg||
nt|josj: 13 tricks and next board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|mamos:  no   oooh ugly|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hi|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: The K@C will provide a clue as to the position of the ace --but East did not show a two suiter which might work in his favour|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe an early @C from dummy means the singleton K wins so no @C loser, just a @H and 2@Ds let it make?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: John gave me some mouth and is right. 3@H the best for NS by there poss.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|mamos:  best plan is to try to grab some tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|don_kapu: North is a world best player|pg||

nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should be able to work out the distribution |pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Lucky draw this @D 6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|buffytvs: yes - but it wouldn't shock me if they pushed the board|pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case he will finesse in @D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mamos:  East has little idea what his partner has|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
nt|mamos:  lts hope for better|pg||
nt|jcwla: A score was entered for Bd 1: 2@S/N -2 -- CR playing it now and seemingly en route to matching it.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Good job|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE FEISTY BUT THE SPADES WILL WIN|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     n/s can make 9 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos:  part score battle|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|josj: if E opens 1@C we will know|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may pick the wrong suit as trumps|pg||
nt|ady: north has an awkward decision    1NT overcall could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
nt|josj: about previous board, that is|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: OK; so 2@C was Precision but it was also poor judgement|pg||
nt|jcwla: Such a distortion, that 2@C.  That hand needs so little in the way of a mesh with pd to become, as Edna Ferber would say, so big.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available and lower the contract the better it is, |pg||
nt|haans: yep better played by S|pg||
nt|ady: sspade lead should certainly out paid to this|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s are in kami-kaze mood|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not good either|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: it certainly was an unhappy choice|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks twice  east can then swith to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
mb|2C!|an|sty|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
nt|ady: up with ace    can now make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@S went down only 1 in the CR so the first blood is 2 IMPs to MGTH.|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the proper contract was reached easily enough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 5@S is an amazing bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: is kamikaze same with harakiri ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
nt|ady: guess the club and home|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|don_kapu: 5@S = kamikaze bidding and Dbl = harakiri bidding|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - hari kiri you kill yourself - kami-kaze involves killing other people  namely partner!!:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: was better for west to have overtaken the first spade and played 2nd spade   defence needed to get 2 spades first and have east on lead for the heart switch|pg||
pc|cT|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||

nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: east could have continues with 10@S  and then switched to a heart|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Difficult to bid 6 @D - easy make without the @S-lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w got lucky !? but well done anyway|pg||
nt|ady: could be useful swing to Rytal|pg||
mb|1D|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
nt|josj: this should be an equally easy 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: another possible tight game for n/s in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make but agressive to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW should bid game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  This time  West had a CLEAR-CUT 1 @S bid - but passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pass by E.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the @D as now it's better to stay at level 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul by non NS minimiced? Clear 1@S.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: shd E/W get 4@H |pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well but this one should fail|pg||
nt|ady: dont thisk easy make Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.inabridge.com  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Being vul W did not open the hand, |pg||
nt|josj: but not too many overtricks available this time|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: seen it|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they might|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--better to pass and then bid to show a real opner |pg||
nt|ady: likely J@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: defence will need to switch to a spade when in with a diamond|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't thread the needle with this hand -- "or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||
nt|josj: 3 inescapable losers|pg||
nt|josj: as is so often the case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the spade bid and raise show the fitting hands|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S better for n/s|pg||
nt|garnetts: After a redouble it is normal that immediate bids by opener show minimal values |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
nt|josj: yes, E hand is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
nt|josj: even more so as long as you don't know about the 5-5 opposite|pg||
nt|jcwla: As I predicted, the comparison on 2 was between 4@S-3 and 4@S-3 doubled.  So 8 more to MGTH to break on top by double figures.|pg||
nt|ady: might  make unless west rises with ace and switches to a spade|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||
nt|josj: but a chance for Kepri to pull back on  3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos:  as it happens if NS play Diamonds West will lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: For NS and @C 2-2? Bookmark this site: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Just wonder what 3@S ment.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Keith is too good a player to be caught that way though|pg||
nt|lml: well he is doing the strip hearts part|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Sorry have to leave-enjoy:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: that always shows the Q|pg||
nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes i think he'll figure out the spade position|pg||
nt|lml: nobody would lead the jack in that situation unless they had the queen|pg||
nt|lml: it is an oldie|pg||

nt|mamos:  a better outcome for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a misfit and action hand.|pg||

nt|garnetts: great end position |pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a tempter for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 triccks for n/s in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: how high will east pre-empt|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: yes that's my point|pg||
nt|ady: only danger for n/s  getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: my mother NEVER ducks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, Lord Yarborough would have to pay off 1000-1 to E here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: these hands are quite competitive--save potential here too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos:  would you open 4th?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes, that is North style|pg||
nt|ady: north may get ambitious|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|sty|nt|garnetts: South has made a non bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Ross will be tempted to bid 4 here I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S is silly |pg||
nt|don_kapu: a light weak opening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S would be my choice as S on first round|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S applies the pressure |pg||
nt|haans: they only need @SK right to make slam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Only 17HP  at NS but ....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo N overvalued his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes david 4@S was indicated|pg||
nt|ady: slam very likely to be reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I did type that before I saw he had :)|pg||
nt|lml: its a hard decision and imps is all about games|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: he might have a shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he has a great hand -- partner is a little light, but I sypathize with his double|pg||
nt|josj: but all four  nines as a compensation|pg||
nt|josj: 12 tricks will be claimed soon now|pg||
nt|ady: and a reasonable slam it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|lml: just arent enough tricks I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's going to lose at least one in each suit I think|pg||
nt|lml: maybe another in the wash|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after the club switch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: could easily lose two spades|pg||
nt|mamos:  surely South will try 3@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But he didÂ´nt bid 2 @S over the double - strange|pg||
nt|mamos:  i agree|pg||
nt|ady: switch the major suit kings and 13 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: also he was left to ponder bidding 4@S anyway and he clearly should have done so|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes, West scores another trump on a club ruff|pg||
nt|lml: so he can be happy that 3 wasnt making anyway|pg||

nt|buffytvs: how would 3@H have fared -- I didn't have time to look|pg||

nt|lml: I think he just dozed off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this one looks like fun|pg||
nt|mamos:  another hand with even points|pg||
nt|ady: a pass out in days gone by|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Had W pitched a @D on @C it would have been -3.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@H from North|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S and then 4@S as a dog walking tactic is fine |pg||
nt|haans: no game for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: hopefuuly faster|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes e/w might get into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
nt|ady: north will open|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos:  4@H should make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have fair values for game   but 4@S looks doomed     3NT has some chance|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S not hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt ny south may come against him|pg||
nt|ady: poor pre-empt   especially vul|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
nt|ady: any plus for e/w may be a decent result here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: will e/w go to 4@S ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be forced into bidding 4@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: has west denied 4 spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going|pg||
nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too much|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult decision for N, pass looks appropriate.|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin can make Mike|pg||
pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||
nt|lml: well the defenders will like the lead momentarily|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: A endplay needed EW by no @C lead and @S returne.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos:  no   the Heart break  looks too much to cope with|pg||
nt|garnetts: very fortunate lie of the cards |pg||

nt|josj: ah, this should help EW to detect the duplication|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: on board 1 Gartaganis won a couple of imps and board 2 was a push|pg||

nt|rodal f: Feeling for a 1NT here Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might after 1@D. But I recomend normaly to stay out there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would have guaranteed some slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lml: its the not breaks part that is a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wouldn't put any IMPs on Kepri's side of the ledger just yet; as you said, Jos, that bd fraught w/peril.|pg||
nt|josj: but if S ruffs @HK high and plays a trump, he avoids the endplay|pg||
nt|josj: will we see, shortly, Jordan :)|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky to go down in 5 already...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|buffytvs: do you bid 1@S with the East cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: but 3nt needs a careful play after a @h lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice bid at OR. Playable.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is a better 11 count than some wew have seen opened |pg||
nt|mcarroll: we|pg||
nt|garnetts: last hand maybe South should bid 6@C and then 6@H over 6@D  |pg||
nt|ady: card fairly friendly for n/s   can make 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just asking :)|pg||
nt|guppy: criminal to do so...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a auto play?|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s playing strong club?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos:  not an easy hand Frank|pg||
nt|josj: X by N shows four spades...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a direct finess in @c to keep entries on dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: There best % I forgot to tell, but all see that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: That would have grabbed North's attention |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||
nt|lml: so probably getting to 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: very|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then it will be 4@H I agree|pg||
nt|lml: it would anyway|pg||
nt|flash: my informant has a slight rooting interest in the match - she's married to West...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@D and @C nicely placed for NS.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks reasonable|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos:  but diamonds not friendly|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S at least - 2 and now NS cut their neck|pg||
nt|ady: moth best start by Yen   |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
nt|mamos:  diisappointment coming|pg||
nt|josj: just slightly more disciplined by them|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||
nt|lml: and Taylor and Balcombe would never lie about the count|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|flash: welcome to Stevie Aarons|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: U can't X and later bid 2@D. That's 16+|pg||
nt|josj: I would think that on the auction, @DA is likely to be with W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well I don't know, I would say it worked out better for them.  I don't think the auction here was so egregious.|pg||

nt|mamos:  i think so Frank|pg||
nt|josj: over 4@C, W has an almost automatic cuebid so if he refuses ther mght very well be something rotten. Ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off then lead that |pg||
nt|haans: we all did :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Mike Lawrence also waxes lyrical in ranting about Ace leads|pg||
nt|haans: new bid 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: more and more popular|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos:  not many would pass strong Club with North|pg||
nt|garnetts: He doesn't like them much either then lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3rd seat very light opening by S.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be beatend if defence gets a spade ruff and waits for a club trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
nt|josj: but still, I sympathise with 5@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case the 10 are in and Kepri more than doubling up MGTH through 8 comparisons.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  beatenon diamond lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
nt|haans: but do they not have a stop @H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I wonder what 3@C and 3@D are|pg||
nt|josj: and I hope we are getting an undo|pg||
nt|roswolf: some 2@D INTERVENTION!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: what was 2@D?   |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|buffytvs: wd Gord|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that was a tie|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - CSTCs - honour(s)|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously a transfer:)!?|pg||
nt|haans: yes kick as they fall|pg||
nt|ady: east might lead a club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|thurston:  always nive when part has the 9 so deceptive potential|pg||
nt|josj: I guess it confirmed the five-card @H|pg||
nt|josj: over the 3@C relay|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it    this should make now|pg||
nt|ady: that was about the only lead to give it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: weak distributional hand with support for all four suits?  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting illustration of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3-3 fit which contravenes burn's law|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos:  a Heart overcall would have made South's lead easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push or do E find the @D hook?|pg||
nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: leading a heart there forced him to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ady: if that fails fall back on club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might the @D was needed anyway, by a @H lead.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: leaders maygo further ahead on this one|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|flash: and it's worked (temporarily)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|josj: well, the @C ruff is there but the @D goes...it's one or the ther anyway|pg||
nt|josj: other|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: I remember once he doubled 5@D playing with me and took out three tricks --does his law imply a bad or eccentric bid?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant I took out three tricks |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|flash: it appears that East's @S shift, although it didn't give anything away immediately, got the defense headed in the wrong direction|pg||
mc|9|nt|mamos:  In Or North had bid Hearts so easy for South to find best lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  ooops|pg||
nt|rodal f: Driving for the @C hook|pg||
nt|ady: trying to bring diamond queen down in 3     bad odds compared with diamond finesse|pg||

nt|flash: so, unless E-W use Polish-style leads, perhaps West could have worked out not to cash the @SA|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes sorry Frank think you are wrong this time|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich one?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a few imps back|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still 2 segments more so...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 9, where S failed by one in 2@C here, W in the CR made 2@H -- so 2 more to Kepri.|pg||
nt|jcwla: S's opening in there was not 1@C or 3@C but an esoteric 1NT.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: When|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|lml: 5@S|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|mamos:  Diamond first and if fails Club|pg||

mb|3D|nt|flash: folks, we're a VERY small group this segment, so please move down toward the front of the auditorium and feel free to ask questions   :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems a swingy hand |pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any for a X from S? If...|pg||

mb|4D|nt|thurston:  9 tricks for Joey, NEXT!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: @D first I agree.|pg||

nt|snoraa: attack, but with what?  c best, but very hard|pg||
nt|thurston:  and that's without peeking!|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks good result for EW here|pg||
nt|jcwla: That would have been 5 instead of 2.  4@H a reasonable shot here but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit to being cautious enough to pass 1@S as South |pg||
nt|haans: yes should but will not|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: i must admit, i've played opposite Michael, so i had a bit of an edge here   :)|pg||

nt|don_kapu: last b for last action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south knows no fear|pg||
nt|ady: in OR  west started with 2 rounds of spades    contract could have then been make  but declarer played J@C  trying to pin the 10  so last 4 tricks    if  playing for KX could have ...|pg||
nt|ady: made   the contract  of the heart losers go|pg||
nt|haans: SORRY Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Next matches should start in 20 mins. from now|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo east should pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 4@H is fun, for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: actually just the last one really|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they might even pickup an IMP here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@H is no fun and a wrong bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do not act in front of partner|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit fun for the specs I belive.|pg||
nt|ady: north got home in 3NT in OR    looks impossible on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  west checks backs of cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or are N making a help for something?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: but the adrenaline kicks in|pg||
nt|ady: one of hr heart losers gets discarded on the good clubs|pg||
nt|haans: This match IMPs by luck |pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Bridge is not fair when you gain IMPs for making the wrong decision|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jos I'll be back with you for F6 in about 22 hours from now.  For now, from Los Angeles, I'll say so long.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: I never see Silalahi bidding like this|pg||
nt|josj: Good. Ty and good night, Jordan!|pg||
nt|josj: an easy one to conclude the match...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: 7 tricks should be fine|pg||
nt|josj: 18 imps difference will convert into 19-11 V.P. I assume|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts with heart finesse on would make but for the doubleton club in north hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: So seems as some should been killed at level 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos:  lock up children|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: this way up has a good chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can some def fun rice up?|pg||
nt|mamos:  West failed to find Club switch when winning Heart Ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: playing on diamonds is fine|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: But might W felt it as a safe sac.|pg||
nt|ady: lowest spade on 3rd round should have cleared the position in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: For make E fail @C2 was the right card. No would have done.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board now, thanks to Jones, David, Mike and Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Still one more trap|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have hided yours Mike?:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Right u are anyway Rolaland.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cashing the hearts would have left an interesting ending|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's exactly what I was saying to Linda here|pg||
nt|lml: that would have been much harder for declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he has some toughn pitches to make|pg||
nt|lml: but now the end is nigh... as the crooner used to sing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith holding us up|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he's making now whatever Keith does on this trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is counting on those penalty minutes to score :)|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: probably +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland*|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: declarer likes that shift|pg||
nt|lml: that is an imp|pg||
nt|don_kapu: lucky it's not doubled...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: the way this match is going, 1 IMP could be critical tomorrow night|pg||
nt|lml: I take that back|pg||
nt|lml: he will just make it|pg||
nt|ady: great defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Paul the Gurita|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: but 19 imps will make it 20-10...|pg||
nt|josj: which is likely to happen here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: best is to discard the club, DD|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|buffytvs: Susy, how much time do they have left?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzpm: bye for now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos:  declarer has two ore tricks 800|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: yes there has been some swings where luck played its part|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: so a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 18min|pg||
pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: so they just have to start Bd 16 in that time -- should be fine|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
