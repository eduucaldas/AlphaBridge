nt|deltadash: it must be something|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: interesting choice for north here|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|sybarra2: I am sure I have their cc somewhere,  .....but must be page 243 |pg||
nt|deltadash: lol, at least, Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if he takes the spade hook and ruffs a spade, he'll get the trumps right|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the lure of the vul game at imps is quite powerful even with partner a passed hand|pg||
nt|po-s: 2NT may well be natural in France|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess he has options of passing for penalty or bidding 2NT lebensohl|pg||
nt|po-s: this can be made but needs some delicate handling|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni did well to not lead a @s|pg||
nt|po-s: duck a club and play up to the kings in S and D|pg||
nt|po-s: good choice not to pass the double|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course 2@s is fantunes 10-13 with 5@s - not a weak 2 or a weak 5-5|pg||
nt|mrdct: if he pulls a @s to J (which is kind of indcated on the auction) he might go down|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|po-s: a standard Multi byBompis (East) in the other room....|pg||
nt|blewah: page 313, 2nd coloumn from right, Shirley |pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oh ,  hadnt gotten that far|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|blewah: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: to the specs,  we are not joking,  the systems are zillions of pages|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i'm guessing the 4-level are cues, 4@s may be keycard, with 5@c 0 or 3|pg||
nt|sybarra2: well maybe only hundreds|pg||
nt|deltadash: isn't it about time for someone to mention a trump suit??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ah, 5@c is just odd and a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I think 4@c agreed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nice play in @h here to generate the extra entry to dummy|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i come back to how easy this hand would've been for delcarer on the quite reasonable lead of the @SQ to a fair chunk of this swing to be credited to fantoni|pg||
nt|mrdct: although we probably shouldn't write declarer of just yet|pg||
nt|po-s: I think we should|pg||
nt|mrdct: he could still score 3@c, @SK, @HQ9 and @DK for 9 tricks - but defence favourites to get their 5 tricks 1st|pg||
nt|po-s: spade back gives def 3 spades a diamond and a club|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
nt|po-s: club back might do it - if ducked and continued|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think a @h by fantoni looks safest from east's perspective|pg||
nt|po-s: DQ is good enough since declarer needs an extra club East gets in again|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be struggling to work out where west's 10-13hcp are|pg||
nt|po-s: a heart, a club duck must be followed by a spade I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: fantoni has been in the tank for at least 3 minutes now|pg||
nt|po-s: a refusal to  play may be scored as a make|pg||
nt|mrdct: based on the hard boiled egg that i just prepared since he won the @SQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: operator - is fantoni still breathing?|pg||
nt|po-s: Multon is a very fast player|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: multon in wincing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fantoni has his elbows on the table and is deep in thought|pg||
nt|po-s: he might have forgotten what cards have been played by now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i really struggle against super-slow defenders as it is so hard to maintain concentration when you have finished thinking about all the things you want to think about and then a 5 ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: minute delay occurs and I forget everything|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is getting quite ridiculous now|pg||
nt|deltadash: great, thx Dan :)|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: now west has a clear picture|pg||
nt|ritong: no reason to leap to 4@h with three cards, so 4@h shows four trumps|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ritong: even if it s not common to bid that way|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ritong: of course, the overcall modifiates usual odds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: there is an alternate plan, though|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming north has two @ds|pg||

nt|ritong: imagine north has @h Qx initially|pg||

nt|ritong: if he follows|pg||
nt|ritong: play @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: either he ruffs and has to offer a ruff sluff, or he follows and south is marked with 3 @hs|pg||

nt|ritong: they certainly have tools for minors after 1NT|pg||
nt|deltadash: and we have a new beginning???|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|f1|nt|ritong: and south has a good hand for minors|pg||
nt|mrdct: it be awkward to deal with the non-anchored intervention over 1NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: *can be|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway, other room reached ideal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 4 @H is pretty good score here |pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: some players might not consider WestÂ´s hand a two-suiter|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d here may turn out to be a lot more effective than the 3@s overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes - i think he would be treating that as a single-suiter in @s|pg||
nt|ritong: for that matter, if it happens that you have a choice with two nine cards fits, prefer the one WITHOUT the ace if possible to determine it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but the advantage of the 2@D bid is that it denies NS the chance to have a normal lebensohl sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: the reason is quite simple, and this layout goes in that sense|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|benjent: This looks like the auction everyone would have, but for Fantunes, it's a little different|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: it wont be that easy for NS to diagnose which minor fit is best in this competitive auction|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Ben |pg||
nt|benjent: 1@h is a little stronger than usual, and 1NT could have had 0 points|pg||
nt|deltadash: Hi Ben glad to have you with us|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|sybarra2: @S lead and likely home|pg||
nt|blewah: 1nt 0-9|pg||
nt|blewah: no 4@s|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the pesky little 3@c bid by fantoni also worked well|pg||
nt|benjent: I play a version of Fantunes, so I should be able to follow them through at least the first few rounds|pg||
nt|blewah: http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf for their convention card. i hope the most updated one|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we found it interesting on bd 50 they found the trump suit at the 6 level|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, entertaining auction. Fantoni knew Nunes shape at 3@s, so from there it was all pretty smooth for them. Right up until the result :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: unlucky guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I hope this X does not mean lead a @S |pg||
nt|benjent: I don't think he's decided to lead yet!|pg||
nt|deltadash: me either, Ben|pg||
nt|sybarra2: true|pg||
nt|sybarra2: sorry hasty me|pg||
nt|deltadash: forgiven, lol|pg||

nt|sybarra2: I am pouring a brandy, any one else?|pg||
nt|deltadash: can't say as I blame him|pg||
nt|benjent: Bompis could sure use one|pg||
nt|deltadash: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: in the other room @s was led|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree with what Bompis is doing in principle - don't pass out the doubled contract until you know what you're leading|pg||
nt|deltadash: and then what??? no, don't tell me, lol|pg||
nt|sybarra2: just can not lead a @S to beat it |pg||

nt|po-s: 3NT???|pg||
nt|mrdct: even on the non-@d lead 3NT only has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: this narrows down the leads |pg||

nt|deltadash: so what's he leading Ben?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|benjent: They're often quite passive leaders against 1NT & 3NT ... |pg||

nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|po-s: Would East double with a singleton?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think they're reasoning (against many game auctions) is that people are routinely bidding light games, and they really really hate giving away the contract at card one|pg||

nt|benjent: And now he doesn't know if Pilon kinda likes his hand, or completely hates @s's|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: the other semi is tied 76-76 with 16 to go|pg||
nt|mrdct: west might get a trump promotion here|pg||
nt|mrdct: duck works best here to leave west on lead|pg||
nt|ritong: south can avoid that|pg||

nt|benjent: Fantunes open 1NT 12-14 including 5422's and the occasional 4441|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|mrdct: multon wisely thinking everything through here - but it looks like test trumps and if no joy there take a @h finese|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|benjent: Did Pilon actually switch to @s5? Poor card, if that's what he really did|pg||
nt|ritong: the problem with " anything goes for 1NT" is that defensers have no clue|pg||
nt|ritong: at the second trick, the @s play did not look awful|pg||
nt|ritong: from pilon's point of view, naturally|pg||
nt|benjent: probably better to cash @hQ first, but I hear you|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
