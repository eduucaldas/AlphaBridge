mb|d|nt|garnetts: EW can make 3@H but NS saved over 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm another judgment hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: did well to get out for one off too|pg||
nt|sybarra: and real action to start |pg||

nt|mdgraham: what are next Saturday's winning lottery numbers? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Irwin:) Nice to see u.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet hand to start with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mike|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I think a lot of folks would bid 3 @C  rightly or wrongly  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H also doubtful -- S has a lot of losers and reasonable defense, though not enough to be happy if opps go on to 6S as there may be freakish distribution|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi there; sorry, but they started early|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: not so sure about 2@d though - but South sure bought a fit |pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: The double of 2@D seems pointless to me--I would have bid 3@D and used to double to show a decent hand |pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the ANC Youth Finals 2010|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Vic vs NSW|pg||
nt|davidstern: which Mike is entertaining us|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing standard|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: From bad to wourse?|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: though a low diamond would probably beat 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he has time to pitch the @H |pg||
nt|marlowepi: six spades i mean of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an aggressive North might double 2@S, but here, vulnerable against not and with a passed partner - no thanks|pg||
nt|ady: needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|april7: S might reach here a @H contract going down without a @S lead losing 1@H 1@C and 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@c showed a genuine suit, 3@C by East makes life more difficult |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|april7: I meant a 4@H contract, but now S is safe|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Polish Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing a Strong Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, don't hesitate to ask :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: dont think he is under any time pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: 2H is 11-15 Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For all beginners, special defence needed for forcing pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ed:) Enjoy.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not in favour of this type of bidding --as mentioned previously I think this should show 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but a low D lead misguessed would hurt his entry situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N loves those clubs in dummy, temporarily|pg||
nt|irwinbo: unblock|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got that right    should just make|pg||

pc|sT|nt|davidstern: This wont be too pretty |pg||
nt|davidstern: looks like 0-1-1-2 losers but there arent a lot of winners|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: W rightly plays the king to get under N's skin....make him think for a while that the suit was guessed correctly|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Hi all commentators|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: he may lead it back and he did|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 2 @H first round of bidding,but better this way,fortunately for her|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: right but even a few moments' anxiety can help contribute to an accumulated psychological toll later|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||

nt|rodal f: A @C or a @H looser to come?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: sorry two down|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Because Brayshaw didn't say anything about pitching in misclaim,cannot pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating between -1 and -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct by the book but also common sence by the playing are inside that law.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: West still wants -2, East wants -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: vug for me. Sr:(|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For now, it'll be -2 until a change. I'll keep you posted on the final resolution.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|irwinbo: no double of four spades in the other room|pg||

nt|april7: interesting hand coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, cute misfit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I thnk NS have a 2NT opening to show both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will amuse East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats ok, so beginners woun't be killed by a lot of different systems.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ady: started ok    then fell by the wayside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is NOT the board, where you shall led the @D Queen against a @S-contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks a normal lead though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - that√Ç¬¥s the problem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if N and E were partners it would be a cold grand slam in either minor :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might open 2NT for minors, otherwise E will reach a 3NT contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may pass....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the basis that they have not been doubled yet|pg||
nt|april7: S will chose the igher card,@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if so west will bid his @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -3 now the road seemed to be -2 always. What happend?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: misclick|pg||
mb|2C|mb|4H|nt|april7: E 3NT and probably 7-8 tricks|pg||
nt|irwinbo: that is one heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: and it's not something you can deal with at the table, no matter how well disclosed, so you need to spend extensive time developing counters to it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: apologies|pg||
mb|5C|nt|garnetts: If south opens  here and west gets involved they can concede a penalty |pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: the defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the upside of opening 11 counts --but this one is actually better than the last one I grumbled about |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: attitude leads|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strong NT at W. Do they use 15-18 or 16-18?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 15-17|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u Xed ther ED? As constructive against a force pass system?|pg||
nt|rodal f: At E.|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: 6@H looks possible till you see the trump break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: best lead is @C|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Discount of JC?|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: UPDATE ON BOARD 2:|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The score stands as on BBO. 5Dx-2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: I don't know how to defend it.  Intuitively, double on general power feels right, but I don't know if it may make it easier for them to find a safe harbor.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: Q of @H is an entry to 2 @S tricks so 5 @D,1 @C 2@H and 2 @S tricks, E should ofcourse continue @D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Nicoletta and welcome:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one of the things that make it much harder to deal with -- you must know how they react to your actions,so you can poke around to find the inevitable holes in their methods ...|pg||

pc|c8|nt|vugraphzkm: Israel seems to have taken the lead now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Playable at slam @C and NT but hard to find bought the bid and right play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: How else do you show 5-4?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surprising that Nabil (N) allowed EW to steal the pot in 3@D holding @SAQJ10xxx @HQJx @Dx @CJx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with this dummy, the ZIA-rule is not for use (If they do√Ç¬¥nt cover, they do√Ç¬¥nt have it)|pg||
nt|ady: if 4@H makes then n/s have a decetnt save in spade or diamonds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: good stop  6 is not bad contract  spades 2-2 ospades 3-1 and the diamond finess works|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: this is a really poor contract as a result of the opening bid and also the rebid |pg||
nt|garnetts: I was just looking --and David Greenwood got there first---the @D finesse will squeeze South |pg||
nt|rodal f: Any idea at the % for 6@S Irwin? Often a good contract.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As @S 2|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that it makes 3NT a good contract |pg||

nt|ady: noone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, I know a few|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3 imps to WA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I once saw a pair with a bid described as 25-bad 28|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would always be happy to bid to 3@S as a minimum|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: That j@S is an error as South can now throw them |pg||
nt|roswolf: i can only see 8 tricks |pg||

pc|h6|nt|othered1: Mike, will you tell us when they've reached a decision point and why?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: of course - nothing in their system card on it ;s|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S 3-1 and @HJXX also enough.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 30-11 this set to Victoria|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: same thing maybe but South can use a suit preference signal |pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe the 2@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S had the @s10 in hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: to suggest a club|pg||
nt|april7: its a rebid after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|april7: a bid of 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess we found one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: but I'm not sure whether it was 4@S or pass.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 13+ having 17 there must be a way to show it.|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am told that NS play normal lavinthal so the 10@S must have asked for a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why 13-13 at one side - and 13-11 at the other in this match?|pg||
nt|davidstern: By west|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: As also here by 15.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|irwinbo: 40 percent for the 2-2 plus half of the 3-1's equal 25 per cent so it is about 65 per cent|pg||
