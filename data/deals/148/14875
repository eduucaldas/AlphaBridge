nt|kit: vs. 4@S|pg||
mb|3N!|an|non-serious|mb|p|nt|pbundy: seems north is thinking of something bigger and better than 4@S|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|kit: not sure what 2NT shows, but whatever it is, seems like a pretty aggressive call|pg||
nt|pbundy: it said invitational - and - i surely agree, kit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|kit: 2 rounds of clubs will give declarer control problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: nunes made a mistake|pg||
nt|kit: but not to be, so a push|pg||
nt|pbundy: couldn't north discard a heart?  NOT that i would expect him to do so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: this is tough, though, because east might have led something else if he thought dummy had only three trumps|pg||
nt|kit: and when they continue clubs?|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh....... i see the spade spots, kit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s2|nt|casenjo:  kit is right, as usual, clubs makes the hand fall apart|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|pbundy: and cayne is gliding|pg||

nt|poohbear: what happened to the score?|pg||
nt|poohbear: it was 95 -90 Strul|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lost the connection again|pg||
nt|casenjo:  still 5 imp difference|pg||
nt|kit: well, we can keep track -- Strul by 5 now|pg||
nt|poohbear: on this hand EW made 5 in game in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: but we won't know other table results on last 3 boards|pg||
nt|poohbear: i do|pg||
nt|pbundy: this does not look like a nunes/fantoni preempt here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  me too :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: more a marty bergen one|pg||
mb|1D!|an|unbalanced|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pbundy: of course my regular partner would open the east hand also|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|pbundy: on a very very good day you could make slam on these cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: KQx of hearts ruffing out|pg||
nt|pbundy: or KQ tight|pg||
nt|poohbear: Maybe in Bundyland :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: i have too vivid an imagination, pooh.  JUST ask my partners!|pg||

nt|kit: in 6@S, if hearts and clubs ruffed out North would have to be careful to win king of diamonds on second round of diamonds so his partner isn't end-played|pg||
nt|pbundy: see?  all kinds of ways to make slam!|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, South should solve that problem by dumping queen of diamonds on first round.|pg||

nt|fann4: Closed Room result?|pg||
nt|me argent: 6@Ss minus 1|pg||
nt|phil: CR 6S -1|pg||
nt|pbundy: will weak trump and knowing that south doesn't have a diamond control get fantoni to put on the brakes?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Everyone would like to thank our audience! My co-commentators, our great vugraph operator|pg||
nt|me argent: with such good @Ss i dont see nunes quitting even if fan signs off|pg||
mb|5C|an|cue, odd keycards|nt|casenjo:  SPECIAL THANKS to Jan Martel, constantly working to organize 6 tables for us today!!!Awesome job|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: scores are back; thanks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: there are a bunch of wrong scores in the other room|pg||
mb|5H|an|cue|nt|casenjo:  Hopefully, tomorrow's matches will be as exciting as they were today|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|pbundy: this sure sounds sign-offish to me now............. but - we'll know soon|pg||
nt|kit: now it is just a matter of judgment|pg||
nt|kit: AKQ of spades looks pretty tempting with partner making some encouraging noises|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: of course on a slightly different layout meltzer fans would be praying for them to get to slam|pg||
nt|me argent: if partner is looking for slam and you hold AKQX of trumps i dont see stopping short|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: THANK YOU, JAN!  she does always do a superb job|pg||
nt|me argent: VOILA|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  So, everything depends on the last hand. Rumor has it that it was a good result for Meltzer, so for Strul to win Brogeland-Saelensmin need to do as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Not like there is any pressure or anything :)|pg||
nt|kit: by my calculations and a quick peek at board 64, we may have a 1 IMP win for Meltzer|pg||
nt|pbundy: ok; now i gotta go peek too! :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: on board 64 berk sontag played and made 3nt on a 54 @S fit when only 9 tricks available|pg||
nt|kit: no, I'm wrong -- it won't be that close|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh wow; that is a fine result|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Westheimer has a 4 imp lead with 3 boards to go!!! An exciting night|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Joey gave KUDOS to Berkowitz when the hand was over|pg||
nt|me argent: and well deserved they were|pg||
nt|kit: This slam can't make, but declarer doesn't know that -- and it is not clear exactly how he should play it|pg||
nt|kit: If Jx of spades doesn't come down he will need club finesse, but if it does there are other possibilities|pg||
nt|kit: I believe the right line is to start by ducking a diamond to keep flexible|pg||
nt|kit: The point is that if Jx of spades does come down, he could then possibly crossruff to get 6 spades, 2 clubs, 3 hearts, 1 diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: Fantoni adopting my suggested approach|pg||
nt|me argent: west is feeling confident about now|pg||
nt|pbundy: only one danger:  The Revoke|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pbundy: i did hear about one match where someone had a card fall inadvertently on the table - cost a 25 IMP swing, so i was told|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|kit: now I think he will take 2 top spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: and whine in petto|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|kit: He is considering unblocking king of clubs so he has spade entry back to his hand, but I don't think that is right|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: he still has to limit the loss to one down|pg||
nt|kit: Now it will go quicker -- club to king, KQ of hearts for club pitch, club ruff, ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, heart up|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Dinkin +6 with 2 to go|pg||
nt|pbundy: that match surely has see-sawed|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|casenjo:  This is the first time Dinkin is in the lead this quarter, they got tied at one point|pg||

mb|d|nt|ritong: let s see:)|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why South didn't lead a club vs. 3NT in closed room?|pg||
nt|pbundy: the 4th from longest and strongest will have no problems - in NT.|pg||
nt|pbundy: UH oh.........|pg||
nt|me argent: 2@Hs got doubled |pg||
nt|ritong: kit gets his explanation|pg||
nt|me argent: so south led one|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|casenjo:  for the same reason they wouldn't lead it here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pbundy: they may not work out to play in the "cold" (ahem) 3nt however|pg||
nt|kit: I see -- well, I admit I would have doubled 2H also|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|poohbear: closed room auction   1NT p 2@H  X   2NT 3@c 3@d p 3@H P 3@s p 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  so much for 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|kit: yep -- here they can afford the heart lead -- provided they don't later have an accident in the club suit|pg||
nt|pbundy: it will take some awfully good declaring to make 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|ritong: they can t|pg||
nt|ritong: since fantoni will likely play the @h jack on first trick|pg||
nt|kit: they "shouldn't" -- never say they can't|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I think David Bird calls it "making bricks out of straw"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: elimination and a club towards the jack, and two people who are not italians sitting n/s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder what 3@C by east was ........|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|kit: Well, now declarer will be able to eliminate the red suits -- but South will not go up queen of clubs when club led to jack, since he is trying to defeat the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe he's going for a club position where they must give a ruff and sluff|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer has to disclose all his high cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: fantunes have to screw up the end game for this to make|pg||
