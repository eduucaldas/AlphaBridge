nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||

nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: agree|pg||

nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||

nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||

nt|jcwla: 2@D non-GF, on a hideous suit, combined with an indeterminate 2@S and a pass on a dime -- this seemingly cannot be where it's at.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
nt|shevek: guess it was ok both previous hands to open 10 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: as long as pd knows (part of the sys)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i thought tyne one spade opener was a little unbalanced in a different sense|pg||

mb|p|mb|7H|mb|7S|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||

nt|h_karluk: one|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!d|mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

nt|lml: I think he just dozed off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this one looks like fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: hopefuuly faster|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
mb|3C|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||

nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 4@h would be unlucky choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@H not a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with not passed hand by the p i think 3@d a little gambling|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: do n/s play drury?|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not but a likely contract|pg||
nt|haans: few drury after overcall|pg||

nt|haans: right second site as per book|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|shevek: maybe 5@h was a good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: well feeble 5@h bid succeeded in doing enuf dirty work |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i would make a try as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard tho to find this excellent slam with so much bidding spade taken up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 2@h on S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Again Vulerability comes into play - NS may not chase this game being Non Vul|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||

nt|lestergold: cheeky 3N would make on a non spade lead but this is the sensible spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: if so 3@H forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2NT=18-19  3H=Forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nah, probably use a getout.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: different bidding style. For me 3@h is a 6-card suit and 3@c is asking for a 3-card support|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: but maybe they ll bid 2@h straightforward who knows|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Can Wolff to get out at 3 level - 3@D artif GF checkback.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Jordan, that's the way to see difference|pg||
nt|haans: wjs do not need Wolff|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Juniors on 26 - they played 2@D making while their counterparts stretched to 3NT failing by 1.|pg||
nt|haans: but i have never seen players stop a part-score if 18-18 against wjs|pg||
nt|haans: 19|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now bragging rights to Emil Jepsen :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Michael would not have any difficulty to make this|pg||

nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
