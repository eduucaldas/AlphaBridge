mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the bidding got fraught - mixup about exclusion blackwood perhaps!/|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|josj: looks like it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahalim: for your info : W here and S in the closed room got the bronze medal in the world youth team championships in Sydney some years ago|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks a murky sequence|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|josj: this 5NT looks like old-fashioned Josephine|pg||
mb|6D|nt|roswolf: 5nt looks a very optimistic view - the grand may be bid here too|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: asking for the top trumps so they will end up in 6|pg||
nt|ahalim: Josephine or JOS :)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: you name it, Arifin :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahalim: a very lucky gain here|pg||
nt|josj: that's why juniors are so dangerous in short matches|pg||
nt|roswolf: an unlucky way to lose a swing -rylal must have been virtuous|pg||

mb|1H|nt|mamos:  hello all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi specs, co comentators and at least THE VUG OPERATOR:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better late than never|pg||
nt|mamos:  hi Frank|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|ady: gramd to start|pg||
nt|haans: good start a slam|pg||
nt|ady: on the K@H    should be in small slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  e/w can be defeated by diamond lead and 4 rounds of diamonds  giving a trump promotion|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hei Hans:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Jakarta in Indonesia. Round-robin finals among 8 teams, 7 matches of 14 boards over two days. This is the second|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: Selamat pagi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello David and Martin|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Paulus too brave for bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mamos:  misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: yes but a sound contract.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: look like 3nt -1 from 4@D and 1@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.gabrial-ui.com/|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT e/w makes on guessing the spade position     |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards for the contract but 4@H imo a better contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  some communication issues|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 4th suit GF|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: I prefer 3@S after 4thsuit with such quality spades   also conveys shortage in diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rodal f: Can't see any cards then the played. Will go out and come back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re all. |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpm: thinking..|pg||
mb|5N|nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if they err into grand will come out smelling of roses|pg||
nt|ady: the double fit makes the play simple|pg||
nt|haans: but what suit is trumf|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ady: if not leading a heart  thenQ@C seems the more natural lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: But on after that lead.|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes odd to lead Ace v NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: good evening from Toronto|pg||
nt|haans: hail you :)|pg||
nt|ady: great and fortunate start for Rytal|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: of course West is actually Gordon from Canada|pg||
nt|lml: this is a four man team and even though they are tired they didnt have time to fly anybody in |pg||
nt|garnetts: This will will not make  North happy--but Most likely 4@S will go down |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||
nt|lml: I believe Balcombe and Taylor have been in every set of the whole event as well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: New @H? Nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: Free for a @S hook and @D play now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if a new @H came?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 3NT always is flat. Even by the best lead. @C.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|josj: well, the defence cannot establish their @C and @H tricks at the same time|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pace so far.|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that would be the normal way to do it in Indonesia|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Pass - Pass - Pass - and silalahi will bid ??|pg||
nt|josj: yesterday and this morning all teams played a Swiss for 7 rounds; the top 8 qualify for a round robin that finishes tomorrow afternoon|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS turn for 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Whatever that 2@S means its not my idea of a weak bid --too much defence |pg||
nt|ady: spades 2-2   so 4@S on for n/s|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mamos:  hello|pg||
nt|haans: not that clear what to do|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jcwla: A slightly heavy 4@S does the trick here of keeping @H's out of the picture.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And 100 is cheap against 620|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 150 sorry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Rolanbd :)|pg||
nt|josj: Roland|pg||
nt|josj: sry|pg||
nt|ady: best lead is a club   but defence then will get 2 clubs and a diamond    heart loser goiing on the diamonds    if a heart is led  then 11 tricks   both clubs go away on the ...|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  unlikely to make  even guessing well in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid imo.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont know their system, precision or standard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard cards it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As to play?|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos:  certainly to play  expect itt  to be bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|don_kapu: normal lead @Sor @H|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|mamos:  misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|josj: who is our operator?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  We will never know, why N didÂ´nt bid 3 NT over 1 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as that moysany ain't gona work. Next.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: Requires some play to make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't think N/S will usu be left to play quietly in 4@H; the comparison may be between 150 and 500.|pg||
nt|haans: we all have missed better games|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT  n/s   an unlikely contract  though would make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Jones Karwur according to the profile|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@D probably the Muiderberg style, 5Major and 4 + minor|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos:  we'll see : )|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play club now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|mamos:  I think club players would bid 3NT  not sure that would work either|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: 2@S sorry|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S made the trial bid of 2@S looking for a check and N took it natural.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Did S have max for his NT bid? (12-14)?|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now an easy grand slam to *play*, but to bid .....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to think really big thoughts.  |pg||
nt|ady: if this is bif in OR   will lose imps  that was likely gained on first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 4@H   by west through a transfer|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
nt|josj: the EW hands fit the EW team's name very well: May Good Things Happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were 25th before the last qualifying round and still got through!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.inabridge.com/|pg||
nt|josj: that's 1 good thing already, then :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Martha Stewart says, it's a good thing!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: played by east 4@H goes down on a club lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D must be the lightest overcall this century|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West passed??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this auction, back to bed|pg||
nt|josj: if 2@C is Precision, that pass is a real surprise|pg||
nt|josj: East will certainly bid on...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is going on?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: opening with a flat 11 count becoming more prevalent|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT was a little joke|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is and they still get to non making games--combined 23 counts--which even the world's best card players cannot make |pg||
nt|don_kapu: depend how to manage not loose 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also makes |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
nt|jcwla: When you think of the hands that a precision 2@C could be bid on, W cannot possibly think has described this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is a joke|pg||
nt|jcwla: How do you really feel, Roland? :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is but if Precision the hand is way too good for it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear 1@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  bets on 3@H?|pg||
nt|josj: I bet it was Precision (but not quite...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like playing grand slams in game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, this does not bode well for MGTH -- a little bit of almost humorous interference and they've stopped a level short of what we could have expected and two levels short of what ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: we might have hoped.|pg||
nt|josj: 13 tricks and next board|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos:  no   oooh ugly|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: The K@C will provide a clue as to the position of the ace --but East did not show a two suiter which might work in his favour|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe an early @C from dummy means the singleton K wins so no @C loser, just a @H and 2@Ds let it make?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rodal f: John gave me some mouth and is right. 3@H the best for NS by there poss.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||

pc|c5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos:  best plan is to try to grab some tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|don_kapu: North is a world best player|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
nt|mamos:  lts hope for better|pg||
nt|jcwla: A score was entered for Bd 1: 2@S/N -2 -- CR playing it now and seemingly en route to matching it.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Good job|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE FEISTY BUT THE SPADES WILL WIN|pg||
mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     n/s can make 9 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos:  part score battle|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|josj: if E opens 1@C we will know|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may pick the wrong suit as trumps|pg||
nt|ady: north has an awkward decision    1NT overcall could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
nt|josj: about previous board, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK; so 2@C was Precision but it was also poor judgement|pg||
nt|jcwla: Such a distortion, that 2@C.  That hand needs so little in the way of a mesh with pd to become, as Edna Ferber would say, so big.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available and lower the contract the better it is, |pg||
nt|haans: yep better played by S|pg||
nt|ady: sspade lead should certainly out paid to this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s are in kami-kaze mood|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not good either|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: it certainly was an unhappy choice|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks twice  east can then swith to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
nt|ady: up with ace    can now make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: 2@S went down only 1 in the CR so the first blood is 2 IMPs to MGTH.|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the proper contract was reached easily enough|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: 5@S is an amazing bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: is kamikaze same with harakiri ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
nt|ady: guess the club and home|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|cA|nt|don_kapu: 5@S = kamikaze bidding and Dbl = harakiri bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - hari kiri you kill yourself - kami-kaze involves killing other people  namely partner!!:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: was better for west to have overtaken the first spade and played 2nd spade   defence needed to get 2 spades first and have east on lead for the heart switch|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||

nt|buffytvs: now things are pretty straightforward|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: yes he could claim if he wants to|pg||
nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: east could have continues with 10@S  and then switched to a heart|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
mc|9|nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Difficult to bid 6 @D - easy make without the @S-lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w got lucky !? but well done anyway|pg||
nt|ady: could be useful swing to Rytal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
nt|josj: this should be an equally easy 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: another possible tight game for n/s in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make but agressive to bid|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW should bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This time  West had a CLEAR-CUT 1 @S bid - but passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pass by E.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the @D as now it's better to stay at level 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul by non NS minimiced? Clear 1@S.|pg||

nt|ady: cards lay well but this one should fail|pg||
nt|ady: dont thisk easy make Hans|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.inabridge.com  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Being vul W did not open the hand, |pg||
nt|josj: but not too many overtricks available this time|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: seen it|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they might|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--better to pass and then bid to show a real opner |pg||
nt|ady: likely J@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: defence will need to switch to a spade when in with a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't thread the needle with this hand -- "or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||
nt|josj: 3 inescapable losers|pg||
nt|josj: as is so often the case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the spade bid and raise show the fitting hands|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S better for n/s|pg||
nt|garnetts: After a redouble it is normal that immediate bids by opener show minimal values |pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
nt|josj: yes, E hand is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
nt|josj: even more so as long as you don't know about the 5-5 opposite|pg||
nt|jcwla: As I predicted, the comparison on 2 was between 4@S-3 and 4@S-3 doubled.  So 8 more to MGTH to break on top by double figures.|pg||
nt|ady: might  make unless west rises with ace and switches to a spade|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||
nt|josj: but a chance for Kepri to pull back on  3|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos:  as it happens if NS play Diamonds West will lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|rodal f: For NS and @C 2-2? Bookmark this site: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lml: that always shows the Q|pg||
nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I did type that before I saw he had :)|pg||
nt|lml: its a hard decision and imps is all about games|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he has a great hand -- partner is a little light, but I sypathize with his double|pg||
nt|josj: but all four  nines as a compensation|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: could easily lose two spades|pg||

nt|mamos:  i agree|pg||
nt|ady: switch the major suit kings and 13 tricks|pg||

nt|lml: I think he just dozed off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this one looks like fun|pg||
nt|mamos:  another hand with even points|pg||
nt|ady: a pass out in days gone by|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Had W pitched a @D on @C it would have been -3.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@H from North|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S and then 4@S as a dog walking tactic is fine |pg||
nt|haans: no game for EW here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjq: hopefuuly faster|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes e/w might get into trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
nt|ady: north will open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  4@H should make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have fair values for game   but 4@S looks doomed     3NT has some chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S not hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt ny south may come against him|pg||
nt|ady: poor pre-empt   especially vul|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
nt|ady: any plus for e/w may be a decent result here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|don_kapu: will e/w go to 4@S ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be forced into bidding 4@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: has west denied 4 spades?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going|pg||
nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too much|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult decision for N, pass looks appropriate.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin can make Mike|pg||
pc|s7|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||
nt|lml: well the defenders will like the lead momentarily|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: A endplay needed EW by no @C lead and @S returne.|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: those are the judgment calls that swing a lot of IMPs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: part score again    10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: bear with us, folks - it'll take us a bit to settle in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: Judy Wolff would call it a 'napkin hand' -- same idea|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|josj: ah, this should help EW to detect the duplication|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: on board 1 Gartaganis won a couple of imps and board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Amazing reverse from S. Why not X? I have also @H and @D.|pg||
nt|josj: 5@S is still OK...|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead anywere|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|flash: i think we missed an initial pass|pg||
nt|flash: i think you'll have to redo the whole auction to get South on lead...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C a sound contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and as the cards are placed EW are making 6@C.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|flash: there are 36 boards shown on the scorecard, so we'll guess that we'll have 18 per quarter|pg||

nt|buffytvs: tough to get a plus I would think|pg||
nt|flash: i believe the De La Salle is from Alberta   (more info welcome)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Feeling for a 1NT here Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might after 1@D. But I recomend normaly to stay out there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would have guaranteed some slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: its the not breaks part that is a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wouldn't put any IMPs on Kepri's side of the ledger just yet; as you said, Jos, that bd fraught w/peril.|pg||
nt|josj: but if S ruffs @HK high and plays a trump, he avoids the endplay|pg||
nt|josj: will we see, shortly, Jordan :)|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky to go down in 5 already...|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|buffytvs: do you bid 1@S with the East cards?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but 3nt needs a careful play after a @h lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice bid at OR. Playable.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is a better 11 count than some wew have seen opened |pg||
nt|mcarroll: we|pg||
nt|garnetts: last hand maybe South should bid 6@C and then 6@H over 6@D  |pg||
nt|ady: card fairly friendly for n/s   can make 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just asking :)|pg||
nt|guppy: criminal to do so...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a auto play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C NS need so @D u just forget.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s playing strong club?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos:  not an easy hand Frank|pg||
nt|josj: X by N shows four spades...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a direct finess in @c to keep entries on dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: There best % I forgot to tell, but all see that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: That would have grabbed North's attention |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||
nt|lml: so probably getting to 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: very|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then it will be 4@H I agree|pg||
nt|lml: it would anyway|pg||
nt|flash: my informant has a slight rooting interest in the match - she's married to West...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@D and @C nicely placed for NS.|pg||
nt|josj: but pass by W does not look a winning action anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: e/w  getting a good result here not opening 2NT  which is down 1 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: a big win for Korbel|pg||
nt|lml: on a previous board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@D better than 3NT?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: on Board 4 nick and judy dit not get to the game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for a 3@C opening?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: butt needed E to cooperate|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|josj: nope, that would be a sure way of going down|pg||
nt|josj: too many hcp and too few @C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Was it the 1@C opening that killed the best contract?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: that was the 4@H hand with 5-5 in the reds|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 3NT making 5.|pg||

nt|flash: year's CWTC!!|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS less speedy on this hand surely should compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: If Strong club, u might beter have some tools. Reelays?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: then I know I can afford to give up a heart|pg||
nt|lml: after a spade lead|pg||
nt|haans: no bid from Liogu is good|pg||
nt|ady: awkward for west|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: especially if South is on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  again games not making|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w did well in the OR to restrick to down 1 in 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: No X from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: hmmmmm  10-12 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 1nt on S - your opinion Frank?|pg||
nt|rodal f: It smell a 2@S from E now.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   poor overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: mayhbe 11-13 |pg||
nt|ady: if not playing leb  eat might bid 2NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: as usual, we've started part way through the set of boards to provide comparisons to the Open Room|pg||
nt|mamos:  purist who thinks 1@S x = four card Hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: A obviouse X from my way to bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At N.|pg||
nt|ady: I prefer double to bidding the diamond suit at the 2 level|pg||
nt|ady: truiph for the weak 2 here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: For shure nor Ralf.     100% 1@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W was helpful:)|pg||
nt|haans: shall we say not a beauty :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w in an awful spot|pg||
pc|cT|nt|don_kapu: strang bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: strange|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||
nt|flash: it'll be a while before they catch up to our starting point and we see changes on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|flash: and we won't have comparisons up until we roll over to Board 1|pg||
nt|josj: 12 tricks for the taking, if you want|pg||
nt|josj: @C 3-3 and K onside, trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|josj: what do you want more?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, Kepri has indeed stopped in 4@S so they will gain double digits on 8.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Got the contract played the right way up this time |pg||
nt|haans: Final word: Timur: I'd say nice dummy ;P|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: I love the @S2|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to have talked through Board 9 - which looks as though there might be an opportunity for the Flock team|pg||
pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks reasonable|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos:  but diamonds not friendly|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S at least - 2 and now NS cut their neck|pg||
nt|ady: moth best start by Yen   |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
nt|mamos:  diisappointment coming|pg||
nt|josj: just slightly more disciplined by them|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||
nt|lml: and Taylor and Balcombe would never lie about the count|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|flash: welcome to Stevie Aarons|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: U can't X and later bid 2@D. That's 16+|pg||
nt|josj: I would think that on the auction, @DA is likely to be with W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well I don't know, I would say it worked out better for them.  I don't think the auction here was so egregious.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: of course not :)|pg||
nt|snoraa: hi All:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know it sounds critical but I absolutely hate that lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: I guess Piotr didnt read the same book we did|pg||
nt|haans: best whith 2@S It was not doubled :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: if he's not going to play hearts, he will have to get diamonds right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I think he will play hearts about now|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|flash: declarer didn't find the winning line here - i'll have to take another look to see what happened|pg||
nt|ady: had it beaten with diamond and ruff and spades|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Both leadss even|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||

nt|josj: over 4@C, W has an almost automatic cuebid so if he refuses ther mght very well be something rotten. Ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off then lead that |pg||
nt|haans: we all did :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Mike Lawrence also waxes lyrical in ranting about Ace leads|pg||
nt|haans: new bid 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: more and more popular|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  not many would pass strong Club with North|pg||
nt|garnetts: He doesn't like them much either then lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3rd seat very light opening by S.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  can be beatend if defence gets a spade ruff and waits for a club trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
nt|josj: but still, I sympathise with 5@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: In any case the 10 are in and Kepri more than doubling up MGTH through 8 comparisons.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  beatenon diamond lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
nt|haans: but do they not have a stop @H bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I wonder what 3@C and 3@D are|pg||
nt|josj: and I hope we are getting an undo|pg||
nt|roswolf: some 2@D INTERVENTION!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: what was 2@D?   |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: wd Gord|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that was a tie|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - CSTCs - honour(s)|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously a transfer:)!?|pg||
nt|haans: yes kick as they fall|pg||
nt|ady: east might lead a club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thurston:  always nive when part has the 9 so deceptive potential|pg||
nt|josj: I guess it confirmed the five-card @H|pg||
nt|josj: over the 3@C relay|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it    this should make now|pg||
nt|ady: that was about the only lead to give it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: weak distributional hand with support for all four suits?  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting illustration of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3-3 fit which contravenes burn's law|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos:  a Heart overcall would have made South's lead easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push or do E find the @D hook?|pg||
nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: leading a heart there forced him to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ady: if that fails fall back on club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might the @D was needed anyway, by a @H lead.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: leaders maygo further ahead on this one|pg||
pc|hT|nt|flash: and it's worked (temporarily)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: well, the @C ruff is there but the @D goes...it's one or the ther anyway|pg||
nt|josj: other|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: I remember once he doubled 5@D playing with me and took out three tricks --does his law imply a bad or eccentric bid?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant I took out three tricks |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|flash: it appears that East's @S shift, although it didn't give anything away immediately, got the defense headed in the wrong direction|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos:  In Or North had bid Hearts so easy for South to find best lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  ooops|pg||
nt|rodal f: Driving for the @C hook|pg||
nt|ady: trying to bring diamond queen down in 3     bad odds compared with diamond finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|flash: it was the middle card from his holding|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: notice the lead has change dagain -- that was the board on which NS failed to take a save against 5@D in this room|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks poor line|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by % it's might right. Drop Q@D or hook @CK is better then a hook.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Too many falt boards at the ending|pg||
nt|josj: and another 4 to Kepri|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes - which is marked on the bidding|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: I think they are headed to the same contract as the OR|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the earlier Board where Gord went down in a tricky 2@S, Darren Wolpert took a very different line and ended up with 9 tricks --so now the lead is down to 6|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder about the 2@C bud|pg||
nt|lml: bid|pg||
nt|lml: anybody know why he bid the 2 card suit|pg||
nt|lml: instead of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: let u know in a minuter|pg||
nt|lml: somebody suggested that they reverse clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|ady: over the top in OR   another chance to get some imps back for Telkom|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange when the sellular need to be at the hotelroom|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS bid game in Or without quite the values|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D high in OR   high  3 major suit losers of the top  unless a mis defence|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|lml: works on this hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure why down 2|pg||
nt|haans: North started with a pass and then jumped to 5@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: fascinating|pg||
nt|haans: in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: this should be a pickup for Korbel -- I don't think he'll have any trouble making 2@C|pg||
nt|mamos:  prefer to overtake when xxx in dummy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: This will need a bit of playing too|pg||
nt|garnetts: should start by ducking |pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer doesnt look favorite here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not by a long shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am just awed that they can get there|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not easy for any 2/1 pair to play 2@C after a major-suit opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: either 14-16 bal 0r 5sp 4hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: can make 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|buffytvs: interesting|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|haans: more control of the bidding by N opening|pg||
pc|s6|nt|josj: if W gets his @C ruff, E has a trump trick of his own|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mamos:  dont understand the play in OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: so about 5 imps here to bring us back to a virtual tie|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to be close all the way I suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: j of diamond not really here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: Have to leave now. I wish you all a nice weekend:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

pc|c6|nt|rodal f: At 4@S the same lead and they took there 4 tricks.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|josj: E should have played the @SJ to indicate this elopement defence|pg||
nt|garnetts: Dec is playing it really well--|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Any fun to come? Hope not.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: last b for last action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south knows no fear|pg||
nt|ady: in OR  west started with 2 rounds of spades    contract could have then been make  but declarer played J@C  trying to pin the 10  so last 4 tricks    if  playing for KX could have ...|pg||
nt|ady: made   the contract  of the heart losers go|pg||
nt|haans: SORRY Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Next matches should start in 20 mins. from now|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo east should pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 4@H is fun, for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: actually just the last one really|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they might even pickup an IMP here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@H is no fun and a wrong bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do not act in front of partner|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit fun for the specs I belive.|pg||
nt|ady: north got home in 3NT in OR    looks impossible on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  west checks backs of cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or are N making a help for something?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: but the adrenaline kicks in|pg||
nt|ady: one of hr heart losers gets discarded on the good clubs|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Bridge is not fair when you gain IMPs for making the wrong decision|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jos I'll be back with you for F6 in about 22 hours from now.  For now, from Los Angeles, I'll say so long.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: I never see Silalahi bidding like this|pg||
nt|josj: Good. Ty and good night, Jordan!|pg||
nt|josj: an easy one to conclude the match...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: 7 tricks should be fine|pg||
nt|josj: 18 imps difference will convert into 19-11 V.P. I assume|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts with heart finesse on would make but for the doubleton club in north hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: So seems as some should been killed at level 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos:  lock up children|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: this way up has a good chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can some def fun rice up?|pg||
nt|mamos:  West failed to find Club switch when winning Heart Ace|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: playing on diamonds is fine|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: But might W felt it as a safe sac.|pg||
nt|ady: lowest spade on 3rd round should have cleared the position in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: For make E fail @C2 was the right card. No would have done.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board now, thanks to Jones, David, Mike and Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Right u are anyway Rolaland.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cashing the hearts would have left an interesting ending|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's exactly what I was saying to Linda here|pg||
nt|lml: that would have been much harder for declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he has some toughn pitches to make|pg||
nt|lml: but now the end is nigh... as the crooner used to sing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith holding us up|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he's making now whatever Keith does on this trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is counting on those penalty minutes to score :)|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: probably +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland*|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: declarer likes that shift|pg||
nt|lml: that is an imp|pg||
nt|don_kapu: lucky it's not doubled...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: the way this match is going, 1 IMP could be critical tomorrow night|pg||
nt|lml: I take that back|pg||
nt|lml: he will just make it|pg||
nt|ady: great defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Paul the Gurita|pg||
pc|c9|nt|josj: but 19 imps will make it 20-10...|pg||
nt|josj: which is likely to happen here|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|josj: best is to discard the club, DD|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: Susy, how much time do they have left?|pg||

pc|s3|nt|lml: so a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 18min|pg||
