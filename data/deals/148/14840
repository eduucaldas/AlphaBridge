nt|fann4: Slightly conservative auction this was|pg||
nt|fann4: 13 and a doubleton opposite 12|pg||
nt|deltadash: agree Jeff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think east should have done somethig, 4@S is lame|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ dubious so 4@C seems like overbid -- keyword "seems"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5 spades to AK it is excellent, and that is what partner has :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "law" abiders can't really make slam try since 3@S just says either we have 9 card fit or 8 card fit and west's expected @H shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Simson bidding @D and raising @H also suggests at least one black suit not splitting well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least those seem like arguments to support 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as spec points out [i admit to forgetting]  Schafer MAY have had MAX DBL available which makes 3@S stricktly competitive|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|harmon: whhen he bids 4c the law changes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what law is that, don't bid slam?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: depends upon whether 2N was pure ask about range and @H length -- or also brought @S holding into picture|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fann4: It's only the 4-1 trump break that will beat 4@H here - so a possible swing to MEYERS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=(10)11-15 HCP, 2+@D    1N=approx 7-11  that should end the conversation for board 35|pg||

nt|dburn: 1@d limited, 2@c possibly canape, 3NT - well, not sure why that should make when five or six diamonds would not, but still...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Can fail that lead but now it's seriouse|pg||
nt|caitlin: It is not that BBO finds it unworthy to show these vugraphs, but with so many in New Orleans, we just don't have the people power for 6 tables|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|d6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, even after that it's murky - not sure whether declarer can get home|pg||

nt|caitlin: Hi Joey!|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D is out of the question. So what else left. @H ok for a ....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I was wondering what Davis should conclude from Meyers' decision to pitch an encouraging spade instead of a discouraging heart at trick 1 - does that mean she really wants spades ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what a difference a rebid made -- 3N by east received @D lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: oops   West and North are Both Walter -- thanks Judy|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: probably down if they bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Not sure of the EW protective 1NT range, but East must make a try|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: they had a coinflip one on board 18|pg||
nt|ritong: was on|pg||
nt|ritong: push|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: West asked to put his name as Walt |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there ya go -- and i was about to say we'll call North "bigtrain"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't know   that is Walter Johnson's BBO logon name|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schafer looking for slam or trying to bring 3N into the picture -- otherwise why not just 4@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jdonn: i dont think they will bid it anyway, justin's spade length is bad with the spades bid over him.|pg||
nt|fann4: Well that was easy|pg||
nt|deltadash: straight to the point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common ranges for balancing 1N   11-14  +/- one point on either end|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Which makes 3N something of an overbid, even with the 5 card @C suit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: this sure looks like mild slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fann4: No real problems here - with @C 3-2 AND @DAK onside.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a bit distracted thinking about Schafer's plan/hopes   forgot to ask  what hand does Dunitz need to bid 3@H rather than 3@S -- and 1) would 3@C show good suit?  2) do any bids show ...|pg||

pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: actually - avoidance play is nonsense -- but scores @D trick    sorry about that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+bal |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|fann4: EW will interfere in @S though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does west overcall 1@S?|pg||

nt|fann4: Dbl probably shows the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last round  DBL has multiple meanings|pg||
nt|fann4: oh?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jdonn: here is a slam for the clerkins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that time Dunitz also held 5@H & 4@D  and  jumped in @D|pg||
mb|d|nt|fann4: This is a pretty decent slam. Needs @C 2-2 or the !K onside.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|fann4: And depending on the lead, in @C you may be able to safety play @CA first too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@H must be some sort of pass/correct situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dennis Clerkin passed with west hand over natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|fann4: I predict NS reach 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like a 1@S overcall to me, but maybe vul opposite passed partner ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson asking about 2H bid...can't hear answer|pg||
nt|fann4: Can't see why no 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson deep in thought|pg||
nt|fann4: Wouldn't a simple 3@D suffice now? Maybe it means something else.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: Davis in 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just bid 3@C and quit worrying about what 2@H shows|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: also, there is a small psychological aspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|fann4: Why not raise the @D immediately - set the suit quickly, especially with the interference.|pg||
nt|fann4: Unless 3@H was some advance cue bid, agreeing @D|pg||
nt|fann4: These auctions can get murky now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson has put his hand down...staring intently at bidding tray|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but was it, and does 3@D show extras, hence 3@C and later diamond raise seems simpler to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs bidding @S & @C -- that's the modern game for you|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|ritong: when hemant plays slowly, it does not mean he is in danger to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: this just got serious|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: What's the need to show extras at this stage? |pg||
nt|fann4: Was 4@H Kickback, someone asked? I have no idea.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Johnson held up one finger to Dunitz after bidding 4NT|pg||
nt|harmon: could get seriouser|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn: they didn't even sniff this one, i don't know their system though|pg||
nt|ritong: it means that he does not want to throw off a trick for no reason|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1H forcing no doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gonna take you higher|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: sure looks like it  and their response structure is  0314|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jdonn: 6nt happens to make but 6@d is much better|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but an automatic 1@S if that is what it was does not get you anywhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H showing @DQ and @HK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: maybe that will avert the @H lead, which i think sets 6@D an extra trick|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: actually -- this may beat 6@D an extra trick too|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jdonn: yes, they needed west to show his hand type lower so that east would have room to investigate, it seems to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: tap or @D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tap it is|pg||

nt|ritong: 2@c is more bothering for opps|pg||
nt|jdonn: 2@c is much riskier but he is trying to create action|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@d 2@c is the worst low start auction for the opening side|pg||
nt|fann4: From the play we saw, it was going a definite 3 down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A very surprising 4@H opening in the OR (Open Room)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe he ruffed @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jdonn: 2@c is especially dangerous since E/W play a strong club system and might open 1@d on a hand with longer clubs|pg||

nt|thurston:  may produce something vile if @H lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Denny asks about 2@d and Ed says "denies a good suit;" now asks about 3@d and I think that was the issue for Jill - she wasn't sure if 3@d was natural or 2nd negative over 3@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i thought ruffing diamond finesse pitching spade offered best chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case their opp could open weak 2@D but partner's playing precision didn't have that option|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jdonn: yes south can easily find out 7nt is cold by finding those exact cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes may be possible to reach a position where you can count 13 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe 5@S just general try for grand -- i'm just not sure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: nice try by Schafer -- but the auction will make it easy for Johnson to play for the actual 4-1 split|pg||

nt|caitlin: North|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Jerry has come back, Jill and the Director out in the hall still|pg||
nt|ritong: keep in mind that a balancing bid can be very "weak"|pg||
