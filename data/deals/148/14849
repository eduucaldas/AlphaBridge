mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Having opened 1@D, you are indeed a bit stuck over a 1@S response.  What can one do about that?|pg||
nt|zebutin:  Mostly Finland is known as land of thousands lakes, there is over 100 000 lakes in finland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one outside Finland understands Finnish|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Another approach is 1@D followed by 2@C ...|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|zebutin:  they might go overboard now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lots of courtesy cue-bids ... let's see if this causes problems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North cues in case South has a strong hand - South cues in case North has a strong hand ... this can often lead to a problem|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|zebutin:  seems they didnt got their breaks on in time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@C was serious/non-serious. It's important to know the difference between 3NT and cue bid|pg||
nt|zebutin:  got=get maybe...|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Otherwise this can happen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Self-inflicted one has to say|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here's the big question: what is 3NT over 3@S?  If you decide you have set spades for sure, you can use Roland's comment ... one of 3NT and 4X should be weaker than the other|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't 3@S set spades for you?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... and most top partnerships don't allow you to veer into 3NT.  This hand is the reason|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or can 3NT by opener still be a choice of games?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting question|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I believe it's better to commit to the major game, and use 3NT artificially|pg||
