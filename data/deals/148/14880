nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: hi Bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to attack diamonds before declarer gets the spades going, to beat it|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!h|nt|athene: NS might make 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: hey Hedy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: if west is on lead, @DK should be fairly easy to find|pg||
nt|hedyg: after the transfer sequence W will be on lead with a natural K@D lead if NS play|pg||
nt|athene: but if north manages to get to play it, then it might be a bit harder - @CK will be led i assume|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: and west might not want to overtake and switch to the @DK|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was nf|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H should probably just be competing - south could bid 2nt or 3minor or something with a "real" invitation in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but it's always tricky unless you have firm agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is a passed hand, 3m can only be fit in @H and cue, no?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: but the fact is S has a bad hand even for the 3@H bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: no hcps and no shape|pg||
nt|athene: ok well-judged - but neither side will know if this is a good board for them - might be 620 or -100 in 4@H in the other room|pg||

nt|ritong: basically, french style is 15/17 NT  here pilon "tacticalled" a bit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: Jo Anne:)|pg||
nt|ritong: due to positioàn, vulnerability and a not-so-bad hand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think upgrade w West hand is a popular thing|pg||
nt|peachy: the club suit is lovely|pg||
nt|ritong: bompis has a tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: worth the same as AJxx|pg||
nt|ritong: all he knows is his pard had not enough to call 3@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I like those 10's and 9's, they certainly help NT hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  Pretty big boost with Sontag's distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: diamond lead is likely, to set it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: o should have said "obvious" not likely|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Sometimes it is better to have a method where the 'big hand' is not on  lead, and the other hand needs to guess what to lead.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: not certain they made a reasonable decision, since 5@c is likely one off versus one off in 4@h, but if this goes down as it should, at least at first glance, result will be OK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|casenjo:  Other times, you like to begin by endplaying the big hand at trick 1, when he has to 'lead away' from honors|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a nice hand in evidence for those who oppose transfer overcalls|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|p|an|good 2!S hand|nt|ritong: probably due to the fact that there is more space in the playing rooms:) then the risks of a noisy burstout, giving info to an other table, are lower|pg||

nt|hedyg: brb need an icecream|pg||
nt|athene: north has a bit more than a simple 2@S bid here, but he might not be all that happy about going to the 3-level with @Hxxx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: maybe he could try an esoteric 2@H, showing a good 2@S bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|tempid: Although for some x shows moderate values with or without great distribution and queing tends to deny moderate values, either more or less.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, south did well to push on|pg||

nt|ritong: sontag had an alternate choice with 2@d|pg||

mb|4S|nt|peachy: usually when defense plays spades, trust partner and continue|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: I mean trumps :)|pg||
nt|ritong: a good idea here, when defense has few clues about his hand|pg||

nt|athene: people tend to with a 5-4 fit and some hcp and some singletons|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C is 500 i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: after 1 @s by S N can drury or bid 3@d|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: or bid 4@c :)|pg||
nt|athene: simple 4@S now perhaps - then east is saccing of course|pg||
nt|athene: east is bidding 5@C whatever north does|pg||
nt|tempid: 3@d being ?  (I like fit jumps by passed hands.)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C is reasonable enough, as a passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: jumpfit, yes Joe|pg||
mb|2N!|an|inv. !s raise|nt|tempid: Some could bid 3@ds as Bergen.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: 2NT without overcall played in France by many as 4 card fit and a singleton by passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT just a constructive spade raise - less descriptive than 4@C, for sure, but still it's hard to see the music stopping anywhere but in 10@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bergen by passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there is perhaps a danger now that north might fear his partner has a very light 3rd seat opener, and not double this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tempid: I prefer that method, Hedy but am not sure it's "standard."|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no big deal to double game though, no?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean the extra is not that much if it makes|pg||
nt|athene: well, NS don't have many aces or many trump tricks - they have a lot of side suit tricks but only because EW are so balanced |pg||
nt|hedyg: and N has good defensive values|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they knew what they were doing - but still, doubling looks the percentage action|pg||
nt|tempid: In this case a splinter by north might have worked better as he could x 5@cs with more confidence.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they need to get the @d going before the @H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: this is 1 way of doing that LOL|pg||
nt|athene: that problem will be solved at trick 1 :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so now they need to get the @S going before the @H!|pg||
nt|athene: actually it might be better to attack hearts viciously and then give a ruff-and-discard - you don't feel so bad failing to double if it's only one down|pg||

nt|athene: north needs to start doubling 5-level bids :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he's thinking about it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d looked ok to me , i would expect 10+ hcps and both minors in the W hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's not easy because no-one forced west to bid five|pg||
nt|hedyg: she seems to have bid her hand twice|pg||
nt|athene: so you would expect her to have more than she does|pg||
nt|tempid: On the a priori unliklihood of someone making 11 tricks on a random hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zaleski thinking to double?|pg||
nt|po-s: yes, particularly when she bid five...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his pd has an opening hand or something that looks like 1 for his bid|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't really have so many surprises for EW|pg||
nt|athene: no bad breaks anywhere|pg||
nt|po-s: we would expect more|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey PO :)|pg||
nt|athene: from north's point of view it's possible for everyone to have his bid|pg||
nt|athene: for example south has a sixth heart so that means a singleton for west|pg||
nt|po-s: I wouldn´t know to double - but perhaps since I didn´t on the previous board...|pg||
nt|hedyg: would S not have bid 4@H with that?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: faigenbaum sees the two passes emerge after a long pause, shrugs his shoulders, and passes|pg||

nt|athene: north thinks south has something like 5-5 in hearts and clubs, and so is worried that east's minor is actually diamonds|pg||

nt|athene: yes but i mean even if he is told XX = puppet to 2@C by one of his opps, that doesn't mean it isn't going to get passed out|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would it get passed out? if it is puppet E could well have 0 hcps and a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: you might pass and rely on the director to adjust the score if it happens, but that can be tricky|pg||
