pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|warrens:  reasonable for South to not show a singleton with a stiff King, but this is a bad start for Diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play 2/1   EW Big Club|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like 2@c by N-S is touch and go; E-W probably make 2@h, possibly three|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: 1@D= 0-11 hcps with 4+@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|dont like|mb|p|nt|dburn: Fantoni and Nunes play a method in which one of a suit (except clubs) is natural and forcing, two of a suit is a limited opening bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|me argent: is this an upgrade? or they play 14to16nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: operator, this makes no sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@c is forcing, either clubs or strong(ish) balanced, 1NT is weak and may be offshape|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nunes know about cl shortness|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the normal @c lead Declarer needs to either guess @ds or hope the defense cant take 3 or more @h tricks|pg||

pc|s5|nt|hedyg: k@H is 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: russinov leads|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all, greeting from Taiwan.|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be afraid to play a spade to the king to play a diamond up, since this would give away a lot of information|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|gracelin: declarer cannot afford to use the SK as entry to finesse D, so guess he will just wi CQ and try DK|pg||
nt|ritong: a delicate card to play now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: but I'm not sure he can really afford to try a diamond from the table, which gives up a lot of legitimate chances|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 2 blocks the suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: but this line is all eggs in one basket - he needs @dQ to be right|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it's wrong to play that way, of course - there may be nothing better|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, Gitelman at the other table played in identical fashion|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe I am looking at all 4 hands and know the Hearts are blocked.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: even though, CA and DK won't work as Wes ca take DA and shift to HA and H to beat it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: CQ|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 9 would lead to a possible missund|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: many specs think he will find the correct @d play for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: so the @s jack fred played is ok|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: East thougt declarer is prepared for club continuation when he can afford to overtake CQ with A.|pg||

nt|poohbear: But obviously Greco Hampson dont know it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|poohbear: might cause them to take " liberties" later|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S it is|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|dburn: maybe it will - but if East opens a minor, then after 1m-1@s-1NT, West may invite game only and East might reject|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: they change room but stay together|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: a very helpful spectator tells me that West would lead @c10 from a long suit headed by J10 or a short suit headed by 109|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+unbal or 17+bal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: hence Greco's heart shift|pg||

nt|ritong: fred considered 3 NT half a second, then rejected it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs in the Open Room are playing Big Club|pg||
nt|henryb:  A tough choice for Diamond: bid 3N and conceal his hand, or bid 3@c and investigate. On this hand he chose the wrong one|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 3NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - Fantoni and Nunes also play a non-standard leading method|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: that what they said|pg||
nt|ritong: an other "good move", considering the @s layout|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|dburn: but given that North has raised spades, he would certainly lead low from an honor and high from three small|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: maybe in raised suit. Otherwise they lead low from odd with honor(or even without) and high even wit honor(or odd without)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: the contract was the same at the other table, and Sontag made it somehow|pg||
nt|gracelin: either a D or C lead will break the trump squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Greco interfered over the Sonty's 1@D negative  with DBL [presumably @H & @S]    Berkowitz in 5@C|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, now I know how - the spade lead was allowed to run to declarer's ten, after which declarer played for the trump squeeze Patrick mentioned|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||

nt|dburn: call me Nostradamus, but I expect the play at this table to be over about 30 minutes before the play at the other|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends how many hands Sontag declares|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N!|nt|poohbear: Nunes opting to get his lead director in as opposed to bidding a vul Michaels|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: lucky he caught his partner 5-2 the right way|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5-1|pg||

nt|ritong: deal, buddy|pg||
nt|lc: Will E-W get in?  I think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and this is a morph into a Standard-like forcing notrump auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  what is their 1NT range?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lc: Anyone for Michaels with East hand?  I know VUL is bad, but still, I might.|pg||
nt|ritong: i m sure brad bramley would|pg||
nt|ritong: i m reticent|pg||
nt|ritong: bart*|pg||
nt|lc: Delayed action on this auction unlikely to be a 1-suiter, so many pairs use bids here as that suit and a higher.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: (The thinking is you would have overcalled the first time with a 1-suiter).|pg||
nt|lc: So, 2@H = majors.|pg||
nt|ritong: sounds consistent, to say the least|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nunes bid it directly over 1@D|pg||
nt|lc: Nunes actually overcalled 1@H -- not Michaels.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it might, but that would not have been such a good idea - 4@h and 4@s both look down from here|pg||
nt|henryb:  from here too, David.|pg||
nt|dburn: 12-14|pg||
nt|poohbear: 12-14 often offshape|pg||
nt|lc: And strangely, N-S are playing in the "obvious" 3@S at the other table.|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
nt|lc: It appears N-S would make 9 tricks in @D and E-W can actually make 10 tricks in @H with a winning @C guess.|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder if 2NT was intended as takeout for minors.  And I also wonder why Moss didn't compete to 3@H.  Maybe he expects to bid it later?|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 2@s= 4 cards|pg||
nt|caitlin: all strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i thot 2 nt obiosly for minors|pg||
nt|me argent: so berk bid 3@Hs instead no biggie|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.  If I had to guess whether it was Moss or Berkowitz who bid 3@H, I'd have been wrong.|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: W hand is limited to 15 hcps , thus the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3-3 @ds should be np to make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: the trump suit is right for the Devil's Coup, but the rest of the hand is not diabolical at all - declarer just has a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  standard count/attitude  suit pref in trump  and Smith vs NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Well, 3@S -5 at other table looks awful, but not if E-W can make 620 at this one.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: he must have discounted the Q@c..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Greco opened 1N [14-16]  that shut out EW  so  3@H South|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  In general, Meltzer's duck should suggest there is something she wants partner to lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lc: Could Moss be waiting in the weeds to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|caitlin: aha|pg||
nt|lc: Quite a coup -- and a likely 790.|pg||
nt|ritong: now the tendance is really reversed|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: It feels like 96-94 in a few moments.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: auction smelled of weed prior|pg||
nt|ritong: and we expect a breathless finish, as often in these top tourneys|pg||

pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfd: they also open 13 good points with 5 card 1 nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meltzer will go plus in both rooms -- and basically all they did was follow suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: this will be another 5-6 imps pick up for Meltzer|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  How did they not go down in 3@h?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if Berk really bid 3@H, I think Gitelman will play him for the @CA.|pg||
nt|lc: The only way to misguess @C is to assume Berk falsecarded the @DA from @DAK (which he easily could have).|pg||
nt|ritong: and doubled with nada|pg||
nt|lc: Still, I'm going with 96-94.|pg||
nt|lc: Unless I mis-imped.  :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|dburn: maybe they didn't follow suit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: in effect, at the other table Moss opted for 4@h facing an 18-19 notrump opening|pg||
nt|gracelin: south only has 17, so he did not have his 2NT bid.|pg||
nt|poohbear: The way that they got to 4@h is also a big momentum crusher for NS (assuming it makes)  . Leaves a really bad feeling in the pit of your stomach|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, although, in actuality, N-S did not "balance them into 4@H" -- the auction had really never died at any point.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: What do you think of Berk's pass of 1NT Larry? |pg||
nt|lc: Momentum can be strange.  On boards 33-47 Moss-Gitleman could do no right.  Now they are about to run off 4 straight very good results on 48-51.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: wow -- i just assumed they would |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can ruff, draw trump, and run DQ to make 10 tricks now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sontrag trying with k of dia to full Fred|pg||
nt|poohbear: I hate passing 1NT with a singleton in a major although bidding makes it easier for EW to compete|pg||
nt|lc: unless it is reverse reverse reverse reverse psychology, I doubt it will work.|pg||
nt|me argent: ruffing finess in @Ss works also|pg||
nt|lc: But that doesn't avoid the @C guess.|pg||
nt|lc: Unless the @S9 falls -- |pg||
nt|me argent: 3@S tricks no?|pg||
nt|lc: But, he might play @SJ to discove more highcards?|pg||

nt|hedyg: Larsen going for the grand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: got to give Moss due credit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: in fact, they did follow suit - but they followed suit to too many rounds of clubs and not enough rounds of spades in the early going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: stopped in 6@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sontag also opened 3N  solid 7@H/@S    Berk 6@H|pg||
nt|dburn: nice work if you can get it|pg||
nt|warrens:  both pairs play this to show a solid major?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they are playing 6 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|gracelin: Greco may well bid it here too.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|dburn: so it seems - not unknown as a method, but odds against finding both pairs in a match playing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 11-15 HCP|pg||
nt|lc: 6@C basically on the @C finesse, but unlikely to be bid.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: he did make a try for grand -- but settled in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Not enough HCP, and besides, RKC will prevent a slam off 2 keycards.|pg||
nt|ritong: yup|pg||
nt|poohbear: but a chance to win an imp on a @d lead :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra2: same auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: how does E know it is not spades? |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and same lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not an unfriendly lie of cards for Meltzer, but the entry position is not that great|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends which side they play from|pg||
nt|poohbear: if they even play 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: well, that @sA is what Sherlock would have described as a clue that partner does not have solid spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you are right all,  ace of spades in E hand,  HAS to be hts|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, how should he play?|pg||
nt|gracelin: ruff two spades is a way for 12 tricks, Fnesse DK is another|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  you have to burn a @d trick, but not that hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some potential transportation problems|pg||
nt|dburn: may be best just to play a low heart from the table now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @Dx to hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: giving up on the chance of bringing in the whole suit, which she doesn't need in any case|pg||
nt|henryb:  could be wrong if East can win to play a spade.|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, but sometimes East doesn't go in with @hQ from Qx, for example|pg||
nt|henryb:  true enough|pg||
nt|dburn: but if that's how you;re going to play, better do it fast, or he will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs should note that we try to comment on declarer thought process and she can't see all 4 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: diamond sayd can be 11 with good dia|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry lost my server :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries Jan -- it looks like 12 to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops Irina|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: low with even cards|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning line is to play a small @h out of hand - but I dont exp he will do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Diamond make this if he [eventually] finesses @HJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Al and Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@C is the last time he is in dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: he can feel forced to play @H from his hand|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he goes down|pg||

nt|pelu: afainst oggs - but can u find a better way?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cannot play both @H and @s from dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: against odds - need a new keyboard :):)|pg||
nt|me argent: slam is on a finess|pg||
nt|lc: I'd have thought 3@S by Berk, then 3NT by Sonty.|pg||
nt|ritong: me too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: I'd have been worried about @HQ43.|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he said to himself" i won t tell them @h lead"|pg||
nt|ritong: but it looks like a feeble reason|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: instead she did it fairly slowly, but East couldn't even beat the @h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the @sJ was friendly in any case|pg||
nt|warrens:  I expect him to ruff a club, ruff a spade, ruff a club, ruff a spade, ruff a club and try to draw trump|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: yes, guess that's what he will do.  Bt will reject the D finesse later to ensure 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: long week greco said and start to thk again|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - I'd have expected Fantoni to put the king on the second spade, just to sow doubt|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|henryb:  Diamond can save an imp by cashing out now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he need to?   i don't think declarer can score 4th @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if !AH @D return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably will - his last chance is that partner somehow has @sQ, although declarer would not play like this if he did|pg||
nt|ritong: considering that 3@s locates his strength, and also that playing from the opposite hand with Qxx is often better|pg||
nt|poohbear: Berk saw the @h lead before the screen came up. anxious moments waiting to see dummy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: b4 dummy show he ask alan if he has dia|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h, 3@d and 3@c = 10|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lc: Berk's "gut" probably told him this @C finesse wasn't winning. :)|pg||
nt|lc: Ooops.  I promised David I wouldn't make any "gut" references.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, if his pard displays a singleton @h and a cold 6@c is on, he might get purple ears|pg||
nt|ritong: would that be impossible?|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose Sontag could have had  @SJxx  @Hx  @DAKQ  @CA10xxxx for this auction?|pg||
nt|lc: Or even  @SJxx  @Hxx  @DAK  @CAKxxxx  and 5@C would be right.|pg||
nt|lc: Uncharacteristic of David to bid an indelicate 3NT instead of a scientific 3@S -- but over 3@S, maybe South would not bid 3NT with @Hxxx.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: that s a valid point|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: no blood anyways|pg||
nt|lc: We've all had these stumbling auctions where each player is afraid of no stopper but the suit is stopped by virtue of being 3-3 even with no high ones.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lc: Looks like a good N-S result for @D in other room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 1NT also possible for West - close decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 11-15|pg||
nt|lc: E-W didn't get to their 9-card @S fit.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will Larsen search for a 3-3 @S fit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fantoni thot about t/o|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10-15 was correct, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect many big clubbers would open East hand 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: even w/o  or odd with honor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: no voids, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with both majors ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: you easily miss 2 M opposite weak pd |pg||
nt|hedyg: here 3@H shows maximum, i.e. 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: by that i meant  Negative DBL over 1@H shows 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I am a huge balancer, but even I wouldn't bid 2@S with East's hand. Anyone?|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|lc: I can't imagine any YES's.|pg||
nt|lc: Unless you can see West's hand!|pg||
nt|ritong: opponents are not clearly fitted|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: i wonder what Diamond was thinking about|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 20 Meltzer in.............5@s!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction on  20 finally over in other room   5@S undoubled -- wonder if Moss will collect 100 honors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he was thinkink about slam he already miss 2 boards ago|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol he can try|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe with a doubleton @H but not three.|pg||
nt|lc: Right. |pg||
nt|lc: it is when the opponents are KNOWN to have an 8-card fit that I go crazy balancing.  Here, they could easily have only 7.|pg||
nt|lc: And actaully do.|pg||
nt|lc: Still, it hurts me so much when I have a 9-card @S fit and defend against 2@H.  It seems like it should never happen.  But, sadly, it does.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: brad mom ordered coffe was  pause for this|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: so IF he had tried DBL  there was risk that Meltzer could bid 1@S with only 3|pg||
nt|dburn: this kind of thing is why many players nowadays use double to show spades and 1@s to deny them (or vice versa, of course)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: possibly a more effective style than playing double to show four spades, 1@s to show five|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's best argument i've ever heard of that treatment David -- thanks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|poohbear: Brad's mom is world champion Gail Greenberg|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lc: If West had a "cards" double of 1NT available, then East could bid 2@S.|pg||
nt|lc: Most use X as artificial.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|poohbear: over strong NT openings|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: Fantoni squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't notice -- did anybody talk about Fantoni's Pass over 1@H instead of DBL?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Irina did :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: she said he considered a double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good on ya Irina|pg||
nt|lc: yes, and this one was 15-17.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lc: Notice the careful (but routine at this level) @C unblock by declarer.|pg||
nt|poohbear: also the fact that declarer is making sure his side suit is set up before touching trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|lc: This is an eternity for Sontag to think.  But he has good reason to.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|lc: Not at all obvious how to play -- unless seeing all the cards.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow|pg||
nt|lc: Even seeing all the cards, it isn't obvious :)|pg||
nt|ritong: seing all the cards, @h A and a @h looked good|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose clicking GIB makes it obvious, but even then it isn't obvious :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: its only good cause the defense blocked @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: west takes, plays a forced @s, and you throw him in with the last trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: never see sontag play so slow, he must be not feeling good and had cough|pg||
nt|ritong: the @s block does not enter the picture imo|pg||
nt|ritong: west is out of them, any @s he keeps|pg||
nt|ritong: and if he draws his second top honor, eight tricks with the good @cs|pg||
nt|poohbear: well had he kept the 5 of @ss he could get partner in to play the 5th one Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy ruffs, no?|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: i think we all are worried now|pg||
nt|poohbear: there is no endplay. Declarer just pitches a @d loser on the 4th @s and loses 2@h 1@s 1@c 1@d|pg||
nt|ritong: something is wrong with sontag|pg||
nt|lc: It is Gitelman's play, though.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dont say that. We already have had one person got to the hospital|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: how is he, btw?|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, while they battle for these 5 IMPs, Fantoni-Nunes just bid and made a slam off 2 keycards -- a likely 13 to MELTZER.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fred taking all time he dont even ready|pg||
nt|poohbear: Sementa was taken to the hospital yesterday but he is OK |pg||
nt|lc: Moments like these are why bridge isn't ready for live television.|pg||
nt|poohbear: need to have a 30 second clock :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moss and sonty went to out cause fred still thinking!|pg||
nt|lc: They never have done much with a time-clock or time penalties in bridge. Very murky area.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kibs suggesting they can edit Bridge like poker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 5min on the clock|pg||
nt|ritong: larry talks about live things|pg||
nt|lc: That wouldn't be "live" then, but yes.|pg||
nt|me argent: time clock would be very awkward but fair|pg||
nt|me argent: like chess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: another camp uses transfers  so DBL=4+@S  and 1@S is either a transfer to NT or showing a specific minor|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lc: No perfect solution.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|dburn: also effective enough - you always feel uneasy passing with those North cards and not competing somehow|pg||

nt|caitlin: or www.bbotv.vom/vugraph|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|dburn: now the old problem - can North-South bid diamonds naturally?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+unbal or 18+bal|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: you look at 2 points and reayly wana bid!|pg||
nt|dburn: slam pretty much flat out the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lc: That is probably a better link. :)|pg||
nt|me argent: bridge was much more tv friendly in gorens day when everybody spoke the same language|pg||
nt|lc: The MELTZER team trailed going into the final board in their Round of 8 match -- already used to nail-biters.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: they can, and good for them|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: DBL=3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Melter PASS??|pg||
nt|dburn: not really|pg||
nt|hedyg: double is 4+4 +either reds or blacks|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but not working here and probably not biddable anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=F1, 14+ or good 12/13 5+@C or 15+ BAL or 4@C441|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: oh  Irina was testing us|pg||
nt|dburn: probably right for Larsen to retreat to 3@d - this isnt enough hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I suspect RDBL = game force with no 5+ suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 1@s= can play higher in red suits|pg||
nt|caitlin: they made 6@H on 55|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: How old you think I am Joey?|pg||

nt|ritong: the operator can claim something different if he/she lost track|pg||
nt|lc: But, according to the MOVIE I look at, it could be 600 -- declarer playing North for @HAx.|pg||
nt|poohbear: i guess thats possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: especially without @c stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N looks ok -- but 3N instead of 3@D seems     uninspired  [how's that for pc]|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah, ok|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: another nebulous 1@D|pg||
nt|lc: You can just mouse over the Open Room: 6@H W = +1430 -- but make sure there are no impressionable children watching.|pg||
nt|ritong: pls score -13|pg||
nt|poohbear: its just one board Joey. They will likely be stuck 9 with 7 to go|pg||
nt|lc: I "always" use RKC on the way to my slams, so never could get such a "lovely" 1430.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nebulous 1@D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: EW do play  reverse flannery|pg||

nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|lc: It is a shame, though, that so many IMPs swing on these things.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: slam again - but this time a bad slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 2@H/@S show 5@S & 4+@H  [non-inv // inv]|pg||
mb|2N|an|3433 or3334|nt|pelu: but only in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@H probably   (a) limit raise in @S or  (b) natural|pg||
nt|me argent: thats why you could never play with kokes he loathes bw|pg||
nt|kit: right -- in the good old days before RKC, we just bid these slams and chalked them up.|pg||
nt|poohbear: interestingly Fantoni didnt open the West hand|pg||
nt|lc: I'm told that 2NT shows any 4-3-3-3 shape.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: expanding on David's comment from previous hand    many pairs now play  over the nebulous 1@D  immediate 2@D=NAT  [and 2@H = Michaels]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N asking for clarification|pg||
nt|pelu: u play @dJ from dummy - If S take @DA then two discards on @DK 10 - if S play low u win the K and give up a @h-trick - DD I know|pg||
nt|hedyg: obvious line Peter :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: they will use similar adjustment over 1@C[2+ or some vs 3+]   where 2@C=NAT and 2@D=michaels|pg||
nt|lc: Well, almost any. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: within context :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|poohbear: gives alot of info to the defense though|pg||
nt|lc: Even with East's 18 opposite an opening bid, you'd think that RKC will stop any slam aspirations.|pg||
nt|ritong: moss has shown relative disgust for his hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: not only did they bid the slam they missed the better slam NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: or even @ss|pg||
nt|me argent: gitelman adores RKC so EW have no chance to get to slam|pg||
nt|caitlin: too bad Roland asleep, we assume, as this is his type of slam:)|pg||
nt|ritong: much too good|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is best of all, since with hearts 4-1 you have 2 chances in diamond suit due to 10 of diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: a roland slam is an absolute horror with the only merit to scramble home on two or three hooks and two breaks|pg||
nt|me argent: sorry i should look at the hands  before stepping in it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|poohbear: another point to this hand. If @ss agreed then only off one KC|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|pelu: after 7 rounds of bidding Meltzer-Larsen are in 6@h on board 22|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: the third scenario will appear later on  the italians were in slam...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: now they just have to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: so I will trust the scores entered by our indefatigable operators - you can make up your own minds :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: note Platnick DBL instead of 1@S   many north americans would bid 1@S  [and if wrong, we'd blame Eric Kokish]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kokish popularized the idea of higher limit [bordering on no limit] overcalls|pg||
nt|henryb:  Might have felt strong enough to X and then bid 2@s, and worried that 1@s would get passed out when more is possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inv minor for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that 1N goes up to 11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gives DBL more of a true takeout nature than the original   DBL = support for other suits OR 1-suit too good for mere overcall|pg||
nt|dburn: will be surprised at the response, but may have overreacted to it - if this asks for heart control, Diamond will bid a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S ask for @H control  might get them to 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David typed faster|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if Larsen leads a diamond he will make one, but...|pg||
nt|gracelin: D lead will soon give declarer his 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@H is wow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Good example of the danger of opening a 4-card major -- that third opponent|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lc: It would have worked better if West's minors were reversed. :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA or @CQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: or q of dia?|pg||
nt|dburn: @cQ is pretty dangerous - that might be dummy's side suit|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, a diamond isn't totally out of the question - @hA will just set up declarer's king|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it turns out that a diamond blows a trick, it may not be the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then @Dx vs @DQ    small is a bit of a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer will run a low diamond - how many points is North supposed to have, after all?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking low @C could [keyword] come from @DQxxx(s)  so Meltzer could hold @DJ|pg||
nt|dburn: the jack is trickier than a low one, but Diamond has no real choice in the matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: chance|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lc: Still, no swing if he can hold it to -100.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Berk in 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: this could easily be passed out|pg||
nt|lc: I don't think they allow passouts in the Spingold.|pg||
nt|lc: They have to reshuffle :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzfd: 1nt here better  raise to 2h|pg||
nt|dburn: that's why the moderns overcall so often instead of doubling - they need double to show a balanced twelve count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Irina|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: fantunes 2@S opener is 10-13 unbal, but cannot include 4+@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lc: When was the last time you saw a board passed out in a Spingold final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: two spades? well, that is treating partner's double with proper disrespect, I guess|pg||
nt|kit: Hampson opened in first seat -- that is light even by his standards|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table North opened|pg||
nt|lc: Someone always opens.  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if u only see EW-cards - then 4@h looks like an easy game: 2@d-losers abd a doublefines in @h - but...........|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nunes want to change his pass? call a dir|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dir not let him and that for good|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what do you think of 3@C vs 3@H|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy for West to give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: not really Kit  3 10s|pg||
nt|kit: Sontag following the principle of not letting the opponents get the opening bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: 4-3-3-3 Barry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: but he can cash a diamond and, just maybe, learn enough to play a club then|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will West believe partner is leading a singleton and declarer has a hidden 5-card suit?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know - might depend on whether partner thought I could be 3-6 in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: will Diamond now try to discard 2@Ds on @c?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: plays the 2 and it's champange for the tab;e|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, this is pretty tough|pg||
nt|gracelin: and East may not even has a trump from the 4S opening.  Don't thk Hampson will give partner the club ruff.|pg||
nt|poohbear: We are talking about Hampson's stds. Not ours :)|pg||
nt|kit: I can|pg||
nt|caitlin: but we would first have to wait up to hour to determine it is truly a tie, Henri|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe it can be right for West to dump jack of spades looking at 9xxx in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|lc: It would be especially bad if lead was from @SAKQx!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|hedyg: thanks for the chatty info Irina :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Q lead from that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: lowest from Honor if length is 3/5/7|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lengths some people will go to so as not pay for champagne :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unmakable|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to the Q and defense will start X-ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't champagne originally created because the grapes weren't good enough to make still wine?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i digress|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: he wouldnt lead ace from that holding|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess they have solid agreements about cards asking for an unblock, yes|pg||
nt|lc: If you know their agreements.  I don't know what their "big lead" is.|pg||
nt|me argent: K|pg||
nt|lc: If I led the @SQ, my partner would dump the @SJ -- so I wouldn't lead the Queen from AKQx.|pg||
nt|lc: I think most play:  "Ace asks Attitude,"  and "King asks Count or unblock."|pg||
nt|me argent: moss wanted a switch|pg||
nt|lc: Personally, I would try to avoid leading an AKxx suit against 1NT -- time for that suit later.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: bd 24 stopped in 4 @d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: no DBL from Sontag|pg||
nt|kit: but at least you hold the lead and maybe can find the right shift|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|me argent: and he got it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: but  over artificial 3@D bid from Greco   Berkowitz bid 3@H Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sonty in 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: not that game is a wonderful spot, but I guess that on this lie, if declarer had stuck in the jack of hearts and played @sA and another, North would have been endplayed|pg||
nt|dburn: and if North had gone up with @hA on the first round, he would have been endplayed a trick earlier|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|lc: Usually, when David used the word "skewer" it is not in a nice way.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: declarer pondering what can be done if @S originally 3-1|pg||
nt|ritong: had to harrap it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: but funny|pg||
nt|lc: And usually, it is directed at me, as in "You really skewered them with that @C shift, Cohen."|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|dburn: the only way to stop all of this would have been for Larsen to lead his @hA - then, declarer would have had no winning line|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|dburn: and at the other table where East was declarer, South led a heart of course, so North did play !A at trick one and that beat the game|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: but of course Deep Finesse never gets confused when partner leads the four and not the three|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dburn: normal enough for Platnick to remove to 4@h, but that would not have been the winner on a spade lead - still, how could South lead a spade?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  40 where Nunes made 1N   Gitelman opened 1@S in 4th seat -- down to needing to play trump for no losers to make|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|dburn: more difficult, certainly - Greco and Hampson have played extremely well down the stretch; the one board on which the Diamond team lost a swing was not their fault|pg||

nt|ahollan1: totally a matter of style/partnership agreement  as to whether 1N rebid can have singleton @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: here, Hampson opened a Big Club but North-South, undaunted, are trying for their own game|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: probably not pass - would expect 1@s, a kind of negative double denying spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: yesterday a set ended with hand where opener held  9@H missing only the Jack|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c was a strong no trump or better, or 15+ with clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@C here is 8+ minors...  might even be 5-3 either way|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: if he was only missing the jack, he must have had twelve hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 8 card suits are mundane :)|pg||

nt|po-s: third heart gets ruffed but with SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Great Shuffler could have provided @H3-3 instead|pg||
nt|dburn: frustrating for Larsen, but he has at least the consolation of reflecting that it is just as irritating for Hampson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different than after 1@H response because opener might hold  1@S 4@H 3@D 5@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for those asking...  the last hand he treated the singleton K as a balanced hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this one with a small singleton is different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- correct me if i'm wrong [as always]   they can do this with 3@D 5@C  because of the 1@D-2@H/@S responses showing 5@S & 4+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: you right last hand he promiss 2 sp and his pard put one of small club to sp:)|pg||

nt|dburn: hearts, forcing, usually 14+ but maybe less with both majors|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: sorry  names not entered in profiles   around the table  N:Kyle  E:Brian  S:Rose  W:John|pg||
nt|gracelin: north may go to 4H if his spade Q, J were a King.|pg||
nt|poohbear: also 3NT likely works too from the other side|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: doubt that North is thinking, but East may wonder whether he's being stolen from (as might West have done)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: the overcall will get North off to a winning lead|pg||
nt|me argent: with sontys overcall game in @Hs wont work from either side|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not likely to stop a @d lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: he could bid 3@s now, which would inferentially be four spades and a longer minor, but it's a big position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  43 another 12 imp pickup for Meltzer  where Fantoni made 3@S   Berkowitz made 4@HX|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: good hand for leading low from three small - but declarer might put up the ace anyway, in case that two is a singleton|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfd: nunes pull 2dia transfer but change his mind|pg||

nt|lc: Here, it will just be a matter of 50 or 100 -- so margin will be 10 or 12 after this deal with 2 to go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: fantoni said major or majors i didnot hear well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i've seen versions of Modified Jacoby 2N where 3@C was any min [other than worst hand which bids 4@S]   obviously EW have yet-another-modification|pg||
nt|lc: I always wonder if this is harder for the players, or the teammates watching.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|me argent: teamates|pg||
nt|me argent: not close|pg||
nt|lc: I've never been the teammate watching. ;)|pg||
nt|lc: ;)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Meltzer did not open weak 2@D - so this auction probably implies @H tolerance|pg||
nt|dburn: no one could, at least not at the three level, so this may be another small plus for Diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i could guess by looking at hands -- but that would be unfair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully Irinal can get descriptions of Platnick's replies|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: his writing like he use a chiken leg, unreadble for me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: well, it wasn't Meltzer's opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure platnick has shown max with no shortness -- not sure if he's shown 6@H|pg||

nt|fann4: who is Joey?|pg||
nt|ritong: a rock and roll star|pg||
nt|fann4: sorry, private|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: NS are easy to go to game with the combined hands but it's nice to stop low here.|pg||
nt|kit: North had no reason to lead an honest heart here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|dburn: true, she could not (or did not) overcall in diamonds, but this auction might deny heart tolerance - with that, you could double and remove clubs to diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course you played a double of 2@s as penalty, but no one has done that since about 1935|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond knows Meltzer holds @SJ   he's just trying to see if any hands where he's NOT supposed to play a 2nd @D|pg||
nt|lc: Berkowitz was sweating out his play -- having no way to know that there was no danger.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c7|pc|dJ|nt|lc: From his point of view, declarer might have something like @HJ98x or some other 4-card holding where a @H shift could be fatal.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: But, no other suit was any safer.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|c5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|pc|hJ|nt|lc: Maybe he should be happy since that means 4@D will also go down.|pg||

nt|ritong: faites vos jeux|pg||
nt|lc: 63 and 64 look rather tame -- but I know the MELTZER team will wince, thinking I am cursing them.|pg||
nt|lc: You could say the match swung on Board 55, but there was an equally lucky swing the other way in the first segment.|pg||
nt|lc: So, on the 2 biggest "luck" boards it was about even.|pg||
nt|caitlin: wait till I tell Fred, Larry:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: last hand  will be back in 1 hour|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ohhhhh   2N was LR+   so 3@C was needed to create game force|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 more.......|pg||
nt|ritong: sontag not opening a big @c..|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS can make 4S on very low high-card count here.|pg||
nt|me argent: what do you open larry?|pg||
nt|lc: 1@C for sure.|pg||
nt|ritong: but berk saves the day|pg||
nt|lc: His thinking is that at these colors he could get easily preempted.|pg||
nt|kit: agree -- if you open 1@S, partner is captain, and he will never picture this big a hand|pg||
nt|lc: Had he opened a strong @C, that would have made it EASIER to stay low.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: it seems like every Big Club opener has been overcalled by 1@S|pg||
nt|lc: here, the danger was a 1NT response by Berkowitz, which would have gotten them too high.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: well, they had a chance at the other table unless everything was a re-transfer|pg||
nt|me argent: EW would do well to reach 6@Ss forget about 7@Cs|pg||
nt|lc: After 1@C P 1@D P 1@S it would be easy to stay low.|pg||
nt|ritong: even so..|pg||
nt|me argent: :):)|pg||
nt|lc: He got by his partner, but not his opponent. :)|pg||
nt|kit: Sontag was fortunate to catch a weak misfit in the North hand|pg||
nt|lc: Berkowitz is now wishing he passed 1@S.  Oh -- he did pass.  :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps Berk did respond 1nt|pg||
nt|kit: Problem now is that he feels he has to recover from his limited opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: possible|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, Fred must be sick, thinking he has balanced his opponents into 4@H.|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT in reopening position not clearcut|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: just like the old days|pg||
nt|ritong: we might miss a pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think the VG operator got an extra pass in there|pg||
nt|ritong: er|pg||
nt|ritong: have one pass too much, i mean|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: but in those days, the overcaller might or might not have had spades|pg||
nt|lc: You could fli-flop North's and East's first 2 calls and still have a beleivable auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: they started 1NT-2@h-3@d-3@h (that was a re-transfer) - double - pass - pass - 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: If Moss knew the score, he would X.|pg||
nt|lc: He might anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i miss nothing!!!|pg||
nt|me argent: he might|pg||
nt|kit: Moss may well double anyway -- remember, he knows South is limited also|pg||
nt|ritong: it s ok, irina  please relax|pg||
nt|poohbear: lol|pg||
nt|lc: This is exactly what the MELZTER team did NOT want to see.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: cannot  freeezing here|pg||
nt|ritong: eheh|pg||
nt|lc: Still, how bad can it be?|pg||
nt|ritong: on a @c lead?|pg||
nt|lc: If X-ed and down one, that would be 7 IMPs, cutting it to 5.|pg||
nt|kit: might be down more than 1 on club lead|pg||
nt|lc: Down 2 doubled would tie the match, I believe.|pg||
nt|poohbear: If this was the other table then Hampson Greco would surely be dbling|pg||
nt|caitlin: XXXXXXXXXXXXX    for the drama!!|pg||
nt|ritong: relax|pg||
nt|ritong: just a game|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Go to sleep Henri|pg||
nt|caitlin: really?|pg||
nt|ritong: soon, barry|pg||
nt|lc: Zia has always thought it would be fun to play an event where you know the score.  That would surely make this an easy decision for Moss.|pg||
nt|me argent: is bridge a game or a way of life?|pg||
nt|kit: but Sontag might have bid differently if he had known the score?|pg||
nt|lc: From Moss's point of view, he should expect the match to be virtually tied at this point (not knowing about Board 55).|pg||
nt|dburn: possibly neither|pg||
nt|lc: Well, Sontag wouldn't want to miss a laydown VUL game if he knew he was up 12 with 2 to go.|pg||
nt|kit: If he thinks it is close, all the more reason to double|pg||
nt|caitlin: you up ALL night now close to 8 am there Henri, and YOU call it just a game!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moss study alans convention card dosnot help him still thk|pg||
nt|lc: I know what Berkowitz is hoping for.|pg||
nt|caitlin: a bid|pg||
nt|lc: Yeah -- a bid -- since "Double" is considered a "call."|pg||
nt|ritong: i do, yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i love games:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asking alan something|pg||
nt|lc: Does anyone think Berkowitz should have passed 3@H before the potential doubling could start?|pg||
nt|me argent: at this point he gives nothing away by doubling|pg||
nt|dburn: well, in a previous incarnation he did not double 5@s with @sAQJ10|pg||
nt|lc: I don't. -- but it is a thought.|pg||
nt|poohbear: nope|pg||
nt|kit: I definitely do, Larry|pg||
nt|poohbear: partner could well be 6-5|pg||
nt|lc: So, you like PASS of 3@H by Berk, Kit?|pg||
nt|lc: And Barry likes 3@S.|pg||
nt|kit: why correct and tell the opponents you are likely 2-2, since no initial raise|pg||
nt|lc: I am not sure, myself.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: who doubles in IMPS?:)|pg||
nt|lc: Well, you could have  @Sxxx and @Hxx and a 3-count.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Brad, make Larry's day and double!!|pg||
nt|kit: you could -- but if you pass 3@H, they will definitely think you have a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|lc: My day?  Whose side do you think I am on?|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: loooool|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: double might helps dec to make cause sontag great declare|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the meantime they made 8 tricks in the other room by taking 2@d 1@h a @H ruff in dummy and 3 @c ruffs in hand plus the @s ace|pg||
nt|lc: I am good friends with Fred... but ...|pg||
nt|lc: Surely Pass-Pass-Pass|pg||
nt|ritong: irina...|pg||
nt|ritong: yellow card.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: chating to much sorry double sneeck in exidently|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: if south is brave enough to raise to 3S on this Vul. north may not bid 4S expecting short H in south.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now, |pg||
nt|caitlin: to make it more exciting  for you Larry:)|pg||
nt|lc: There you have it.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes!|pg||
nt|dburn: your own - surely anyone who bids to the three level with only seven trumps should get doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: west will bid soooooooooooooooooooooooon|pg||
nt|lc: And the opening lead will be ?|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c.|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: David lighten up!!|pg||
nt|lc: Experts tend to prefer leading from KINGS not JACKS -- in general.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: at this rate, we will know in about twenty minutes|pg||
nt|kit: Moss did well backing his judgment -- but remember, his partner did bid 1NT, so he knows opponents in 5-2 fit and his partner has spade honor|pg||
nt|ritong: but here dec is known 5/5|pg||
nt|ritong: yes!|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.  Are we being teased?  The Vugraph operator may cause a heart attack in the Meltzer and Diamond suites.|pg||
nt|me argent: now another hour for the lead|pg||
nt|kit: is somebody really thinking about doing something now?|pg||
nt|lc: I can picture poor Rose -- she must be dying.|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: sounds like a retransfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=no  you play the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and if that showed shortage, West owed East at least one more bid - but it was probably just another re-transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: On 45  Moss also in 3@H   i thought he might [keyword] downgrade the hand and open 15-17 NT which would allow them to play 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but tendency seems to be    never downgrade -- sometimes upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: wrong sides hearts bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|pg||
nt|caitlin: the lead.............|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: strange texas transfer with only 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: Fontoni-Nunes are not known for their speed - but we are 4 boards ahead of OR|pg||
nt|pelu: best to duck - or knock out @CA first |pg||
nt|pelu: often N will have 2 Aces - but he is lucky here - the problem with the duck is, that S - if @DA in N can attack that suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would help declarer to know @CAx instead of @CAxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter - do you see any reason to guess this hand correctly?|pg||
nt|pelu: the only clue is the X from S - with only 2@s's a good chance that S has 2 of the missing Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: crikey - that was a good view|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: cl lead makes easy after 5 dia|pg||
nt|poohbear: potential imp available on the last board too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra2: french flag other direction|pg||
nt|ritong: ergl|pg||
nt|poohbear: if EW play 2M|pg||
nt|kit: difference between down 1 and down 2 could be the match|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: only 5@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oops sorry |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|kit: I don't understand why make a risky lead when dummy is broke.  Makes no sense to me.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: no double, no trouble.|pg||
nt|poohbear: keep in mind that the results here are unofficial. We wont know the actual result till the players compare|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|me argent: 4@Ss over 3@Ds would have been clearer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: but not very suitable for NT play|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Hs |pg||
nt|dburn: I guess Platnick took the view that 4@s was his side's most likely game - but that does seem a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he figured best chance to tap declarer was by leading his best suit.|pg||
nt|ritong: makes sense|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: not to me -- not even clear that tapping declarer is the right game plan|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway, the lead seems to have lost a vital tempo|pg||
nt|poohbear: in the other room they tapped declarer into 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
