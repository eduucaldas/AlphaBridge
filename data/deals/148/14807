nt|rodal f: Hi Irwin:) Nice to see u.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet hand to start with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mike|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the 4th and final segment of the 2010 ANC Youth Finals|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I think a lot of folks would bid 3 @C  rightly or wrongly  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H also doubtful -- S has a lot of losers and reasonable defense, though not enough to be happy if opps go on to 6S as there may be freakish distribution|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi there; sorry, but they started early|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: not so sure about 2@d though - but South sure bought a fit |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: The double of 2@D seems pointless to me--I would have bid 3@D and used to double to show a decent hand |pg||

nt|hawe45:  2 @D must have showed a @D-suit - but where is it, this is no suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not best to try that at home, overcalling on Q9632 - partner will have a singleton and you will go for 1100   |pg||

pc|sA|nt|woozle: Howard only needs to lead a spade to beat this quickly, unless it's that one|pg||

nt|davidstern: Things are pretty bad when you lose 4 trump tricks befor looking at the rest of the hand???|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzkm: but the scores are not up to date, working on it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do S have for the 4@S vul when W ain't limited?|pg||

nt|davidstern: OK there we have it 4@S down 3|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the ANC Youth Finals 2010|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Vic vs NSW|pg||
nt|davidstern: which Mike is entertaining us|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: From bad to wourse?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: though a low diamond would probably beat 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he has time to pitch the @H |pg||
nt|marlowepi: six spades i mean of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an aggressive North might double 2@S, but here, vulnerable against not and with a passed partner - no thanks|pg||
nt|ady: needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|april7: S might reach here a @H contract going down without a @S lead losing 1@H 1@C and 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@c showed a genuine suit, 3@C by East makes life more difficult |pg||
pc|dT|nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|april7: I meant a 4@H contract, but now S is safe|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Polish Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing a Strong Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, don't hesitate to ask :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: dont think he is under any time pressure|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugrapha4: 2H is 11-15 Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For all beginners, special defence needed for forcing pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ed:) Enjoy.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: Not in favour of this type of bidding --as mentioned previously I think this should show 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but a low D lead misguessed would hurt his entry situation|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: N loves those clubs in dummy, temporarily|pg||
nt|irwinbo: unblock|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: got that right    should just make|pg||

nt|davidstern: This wont be too pretty |pg||
nt|davidstern: looks like 0-1-1-2 losers but there arent a lot of winners|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: W rightly plays the king to get under N's skin....make him think for a while that the suit was guessed correctly|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|vugrapha4: Hi all commentators|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may lead it back and he did|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 2 @H first round of bidding,but better this way,fortunately for her|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: right but even a few moments' anxiety can help contribute to an accumulated psychological toll later|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Hands on table for D's approval|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @C or a @H looser to come?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: sorry two down|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Because Brayshaw didn't say anything about pitching in misclaim,cannot pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating between -1 and -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct by the book but also common sence by the playing are inside that law.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: West still wants -2, East wants -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: vug for me. Sr:(|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For now, it'll be -2 until a change. I'll keep you posted on the final resolution.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|irwinbo: no double of four spades in the other room|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|davidstern: Likely -2 now|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was "assuming" NOrth may try for a club ruff to limit the damage|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the road for that now.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: still 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: -2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzkm: look at round 11, thats the standing before this round. round 12 is simply wrong|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: now the club cash pitch  a ht |pg||
pc|hT|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: odd that West played a second club rather than playing on diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: In USA tournament play, we get exactly no experience against forcing pass systems, which are barred without reservation.  Our loss.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but then North can win and play a second club I guess, and it's back to the same position effectively|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice misfit here|pg||
nt|april7: interesting hand coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, cute misfit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I thnk NS have a 2NT opening to show both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will amuse East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats ok, so beginners woun't be killed by a lot of different systems.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: started ok    then fell by the wayside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is NOT the board, where you shall led the @D Queen against a @S-contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks a normal lead though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - that√Ç¬¥s the problem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if N and E were partners it would be a cold grand slam in either minor :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might open 2NT for minors, otherwise E will reach a 3NT contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may pass....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the basis that they have not been doubled yet|pg||
nt|april7: S will chose the igher card,@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if so west will bid his @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -3 now the road seemed to be -2 always. What happend?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: misclick|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|april7: E 3NT and probably 7-8 tricks|pg||
nt|irwinbo: that is one heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: and it's not something you can deal with at the table, no matter how well disclosed, so you need to spend extensive time developing counters to it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: apologies|pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: If south opens  here and west gets involved they can concede a penalty |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: the defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the upside of opening 11 counts --but this one is actually better than the last one I grumbled about |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: attitude leads|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strong NT at W. Do they use 15-18 or 16-18?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 15-17|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u Xed ther ED? As constructive against a force pass system?|pg||
nt|rodal f: At E.|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 6@H looks possible till you see the trump break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: best lead is @C|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vugrapha4: cheers Rodal :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think this can be made but will need careful play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did E have for a 4@D at the road?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: should not lose more than1 clu and 2 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-quess!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: The score stands as on BBO. 5Dx-2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I don't know how to defend it.  Intuitively, double on general power feels right, but I don't know if it may make it easier for them to find a safe harbor.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: Q of @H is an entry to 2 @S tricks so 5 @D,1 @C 2@H and 2 @S tricks, E should ofcourse continue @D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: there is 9 tricks secured |pg||

nt|shevek: hi everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Nicoletta and welcome:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one of the things that make it much harder to deal with -- you must know how they react to your actions,so you can poke around to find the inevitable holes in their methods ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4nt should be an attempt to play there i think|pg||

nt|garnetts: three potential bids 4NT  5@C  5@D  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: I don't maen to be rude, but this bidding is crazy. How can West bid 3NT, which might be the right contract, with two small hearts? |pg||
