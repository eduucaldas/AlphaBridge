nt|roswolf: from the north side 3nt looks infrangible|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Infrangible is a word I use at least 15 times a day|pg||
nt|jtr: @s lead was it?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|jcmax: a Polish style 1C basically means that all balanced hands are opened with 1@C, unless they are opened with 1NT|pg||

nt|daman: not a trying contract now|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? what are his 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be so easy from here. zia will have to find a @D switch. And when declarer plays low from dummy W will have to duck his K|pg||
nt|jtr: Which?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|henryb:  I see 8. but a passive defense might create trouble|pg||

nt|jcmax: That 3@C bid was not without risk. But without it might S have led a @D against 4@S? that would have given declarer an easier time|pg||

nt|jcmax: We all can see that declarer can succeed easily by taking the trump finesse, drawing trumps, playing a low @D to his A and giving up a trick to the @DJ. But playing the @D-suit ...|pg||

nt|jcmax: He didn't have to cope with a 1NT overcall, though, like in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clearcut |pg||
nt|henryb:  Why is it that my partners are always 2-0-6-5 when I bid that way? with a good hand that makes 6@c cold and 4@h goes down on a bad trump break:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because you are an honourable member of the VUBPW, Henry|pg||
nt|jcmax: Not clear to me this will make. If S goes out of his way showing declarer all his points, declarer may misguess the @H|pg||

nt|henryb:  terrible contract. once again 3N is better, as it was on board 3|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now however declarer runs the risk of getting into a situation, where he in the endgame persuades himself that N is left with a doubleton @C-honour|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|henryb:  if East had won the @dA and played a trump declarer would have had no play|pg||
nt|henryb:  west could win the second diamond and play a second trump, limiting declarer to 5 trumps, a ruff and a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|jcmax: Ah yes, that is correct! Then w could have played a 2nd round of trumps when in with the @DK. Declarer would only have been able to ruff 1@H in dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: Director is back|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: There is one on one side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: the problem was east offered to give north south a redo|pg||

nt|daman: with great skill Sabine :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I don't know. |pg||
nt|jcmax: There isn't really much to the play here as we can see. But declarer is worried about trumps being 5-1, which would complicate matters.|pg||
nt|daman: he has 10 toppers   what would we do at MPs?|pg||
