nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Free for a @S hook and @D play now.|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-SÃ¸rensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|mamos:  no   oooh ugly|pg||

nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: John gave me some mouth and is right. 3@H the best for NS by there poss.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos:  best plan is to try to grab some tricks|pg||

pc|s8|pc|d6|pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  Lucky draw this @D 6|pg||

nt|rodal f: A'm so happy that the childs are out at the feeeezzzzzing wather and not watching this murder.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: I think it's hard to bid 5@D EW|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Was the trap. @S was needed anyway. Why not @S?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|lml: I was asked if it was common to bid with zero points... no|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: but with the notrump bid he wasn't showing more than a few|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but South is limtied since he didn't double the 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I thought he might even bid 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes and the diamond singleton and four trump count as dummy points|pg||
nt|lml: 3@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lml: that for sure shows nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: director call  one side was not alerted to the transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: however he has to be careful -- he doesn't want to push the opponents into something like a slam when he has no defence|pg||
nt|guppy: N/S will be delighted with that result....|pg||
nt|lml: there can be no redress for north south they already got blood|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

pc|h9|nt|roswolf: well i might have tried 3@D|pg||

nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
nt|mamos:  lts hope for better|pg||
mb|1C|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     n/s can make 9 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos:  part score battle|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||

nt|sharkey: penalty....:(|pg||

nt|h_karluk: guys, did i read wrong?  24  after @h K lead now way to set, but DD defense @d lead then underlead @h A could be different when was in with @sA, so 2@s. 1@d, @h could result off ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one|pg||

mb|1C|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW should bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This time  West had a CLEAR-CUT 1 @S bid - but passed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the @D as now it's better to stay at level 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul by non NS minimiced? Clear 1@S.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||

nt|lml: it is an oldie|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|rodal f: 48% for 2-2 and 52% for 1-3 or 3-1. Did odd change by Ws @C play?|pg||

nt|lml: I guess but my mom could see the endplay... if she had her glasses on|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only 17HP  at NS but ....|pg||
mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: I did type that before I saw he had :)|pg||
nt|lml: its a hard decision and imps is all about games|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: he might have a shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he has a great hand -- partner is a little light, but I sypathize with his double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lml: just arent enough tricks I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's going to lose at least one in each suit I think|pg||
nt|lml: maybe another in the wash|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after the club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: could easily lose two spades|pg||
nt|mamos:  surely South will try 3@S|pg||

nt|lml: there is a promotion|pg||
nt|lml: even on a good spade guess|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, West scores another trump on a club ruff|pg||
nt|lml: so he can be happy that 3 wasnt making anyway|pg||
nt|lml: and I said promotion like I am supposed to and not uppercut|pg||
nt|buffytvs: how would 3@H have fared -- I didn't have time to look|pg||
nt|lml: like I usually do|pg||
nt|lml: okay if he plays ace and one it is an overruff|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lml: I think he goes down 2 even without the promotion.. |pg||
nt|lml: overruff|pg||
nt|lml: whatever|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a heart now gest ruffed, declarer can cash the @SQ, but then has to play a club from dummy himself|pg||

nt|h_karluk: or at the table singleton, i think that means a trick for the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: And see what happens after a @d lead and a @c shift|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a direct finess in @c to keep entries on dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: There best % I forgot to tell, but all see that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||

nt|flash: my informant has a slight rooting interest in the match - she's married to West...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  getting a good result here not opening 2NT  which is down 1 |pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|lml: a big win for Korbel|pg||

nt|h_karluk: when i first started to VG <maybe 4 years ago>i got a good lesson from Roland, unless you are sure off two never double|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP to Bridgeministeriet in the 3NT on 25.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen left for toilet|pg||
nt|haans: ok for 3 in  suit but mb not 3nt directing lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s on EW|pg||

nt|jcwla: Which I'm guessing is how it was intended.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this again will be competitive|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: Hansen had no count of clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|haans: NS may not find their suit|pg||
nt|haans: east poins are aces|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: is that really a vul 1@H overcall!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbiddable i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Cud be a 11 IMPs back to NÃ¦sten Junior|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it is how high e/w will compete to if at all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: two way c hook and a missing hearts Q which offside|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and normally you shouldnÂ´t go wrong in 6@s, @hA and @hK and if @hQ still is out, finess in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with an auto @d loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west will double?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after this auction 2@s by East was possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may PASS Geoff:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: What's 2@H?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2@H was reverse (strong)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: declarer looks in control here|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S did show 17+|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: 14 points incl stiff @CQ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: finesse for @c Q but to which direction sir|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: the stratosphere is in danger|pg||

nt|roswolf: north appears still to be|pg||

nt|haans: still why 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it was alerted maybe peter can tell us?|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|mamos:  NS less speedy on this hand surely should compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: If Strong club, u might beter have some tools. Reelays?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: then I know I can afford to give up a heart|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lml: especially if South is on lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: It smell a 2@S from E now.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   poor overcall|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|flash: as usual, we've started part way through the set of boards to provide comparisons to the Open Room|pg||

nt|rodal f: A obviouse X from my way to bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At N.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: But W was helpful:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||
nt|flash: it'll be a while before they catch up to our starting point and we see changes on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|flash: and we won't have comparisons up until we roll over to Board 1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I love the @S2|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to have talked through Board 9 - which looks as though there might be an opportunity for the Flock team|pg||
pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks reasonable|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mamos:  but diamonds not friendly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
nt|mamos:  diisappointment coming|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||
nt|lml: and Taylor and Balcombe would never lie about the count|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|nt|flash: welcome to Stevie Aarons|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: different bidding style. For me 3@h is a 6-card suit and 3@c is asking for a 3-card support|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: but maybe they ll bid 2@h straightforward who knows|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can Wolff to get out at 3 level - 3@D artif GF checkback.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Jordan, that's the way to see difference|pg||
nt|haans: wjs do not need Wolff|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Juniors on 26 - they played 2@D making while their counterparts stretched to 3NT failing by 1.|pg||
nt|haans: but i have never seen players stop a part-score if 18-18 against wjs|pg||
nt|haans: 19|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now bragging rights to Emil Jepsen :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Michael would not have any difficulty to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless hook for @cJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most probably he's think for timing & entries|pg||
nt|haans: @HA unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K at hand would be nice |pg||
nt|haans: certain he know that now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just some safety play in case 5 |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: interesing that on hand where dim slam was missed no 8, and they played in 5@s was good result ,because in open n/s were allowed to play in 5@h doubled for only 300!|pg||

nt|mamos:  i think so Frank|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|mamos:  not many would pass strong Club with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
mb|3C|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: wd Gord|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|mamos:  a Heart overcall would have made South's lead easier|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push or do E find the @D hook?|pg||
nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: leading a heart there forced him to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ady: if that fails fall back on club finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might the @D was needed anyway, by a @H lead.|pg||

nt|mamos:  ooops|pg||
nt|rodal f: Driving for the @C hook|pg||
nt|ady: trying to bring diamond queen down in 3     bad odds compared with diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|flash: it was the middle card from his holding|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: notice the lead has change dagain -- that was the board on which NS failed to take a save against 5@D in this room|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||
