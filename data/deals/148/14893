mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play 2/1   EW Big Club|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like 2@c by N-S is touch and go; E-W probably make 2@h, possibly three|pg||
mb|2H|an|relay|nt|hedyg: 1@D= 0-11 hcps with 4+@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: Fantoni and Nunes play a method in which one of a suit (except clubs) is natural and forcing, two of a suit is a limited opening bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: operator, this makes no sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@c is forcing, either clubs or strong(ish) balanced, 1NT is weak and may be offshape|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nunes know about cl shortness|pg||
nt|poohbear: On the normal @c lead Declarer needs to either guess @ds or hope the defense cant take 3 or more @h tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: his luck is in|pg||
nt|poohbear: @hsblock|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: k@H is 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: russinov leads|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all, greeting from Taiwan.|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be afraid to play a spade to the king to play a diamond up, since this would give away a lot of information|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|gracelin: declarer cannot afford to use the SK as entry to finesse D, so guess he will just wi CQ and try DK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: but I'm not sure he can really afford to try a diamond from the table, which gives up a lot of legitimate chances|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: but this line is all eggs in one basket - he needs @dQ to be right|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it's wrong to play that way, of course - there may be nothing better|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, Gitelman at the other table played in identical fashion|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe I am looking at all 4 hands and know the Hearts are blocked.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: even though, CA and DK won't work as Wes ca take DA and shift to HA and H to beat it.|pg||
nt|gracelin: CQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: many specs think he will find the correct @d play for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gracelin: East thougt declarer is prepared for club continuation when he can afford to overtake CQ with A.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: I can't stand to see Joey all alone, so I'll step in here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|caitlin: Nunes also overtook with @CA|pg||
nt|ritong: so do i|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: yeah -- just play for 50-50 @DQ onside.|pg||
nt|lc: Here, strong @C and X = 5-7 type hand -- any shape.|pg||
nt|lc: East Pass on round 2 tends to show balanced hand, and West's 3@H obvious.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: I am sorry I am trying to fix the score as we speak.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|lc: So, declarer has to lose 3@H and a spade -- and you'd think something else.|pg||
nt|me argent: seeing all cards can be missleading as to proper technical play|pg||
nt|lc: I think Joey is referring to Board 33 -- where both declarers opted to play for the straighforward @DQ onside.|pg||
nt|me argent: i am|pg||
nt|ritong: Q on or A on is equivalent|pg||
nt|ritong: AQx on is not|pg||
nt|caitlin: both down 3|pg||
nt|lc: Many ask about leading from xxx -- which card to lead.  When you have supported the suit, as here, leading HIGH is clear -- usually very readable.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|me argent: these boys declare better than me so i hesitate to criticise|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, but your French is better, Joey.|pg||
nt|me argent: much|pg||
nt|ritong: i d tend to agree:)|pg||
nt|lc: I'm trying to understand Gitelman's low @S at trick 1.  Maybe he thought his partner led the 7 from 107x?|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer still rates to lose 3@H and a trick in each minor, eventually. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lc: What if Moss never plays a @D?|pg||
nt|lc: Oh well -- moot point now.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|me argent: im sure moss RARELY  if ever has led low from 3 small|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lc: So, now declarer will need the @C finesse unless there is some sort of black-suit criss-cross aqueeze lurking.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cT|pc|d9|nt|lc: Not that declarer would play for it, but I think he now can sqz South.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: criss cross works, yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+unbal or 17+bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: hence Greco's heart shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  makes 5@D (with the @C guess) but down in 5@C because of the @D ruff|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  5@c is easy; but perhaps hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7   1@H=4+@H, forcing 1 round|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=6-7, 0-2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW system summary form: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=659&pid=813|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: lead solve all problems for declarer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: catrds are not lying well for declarer, but a spade lead may help a little bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: att lead now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when 1@H is 4 card suit -- opener either has 5+@C/@D or 4441|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if 2@C denied 4+@S :(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs in the Open Room are playing Big Club|pg||
nt|henryb:  A tough choice for Diamond: bid 3N and conceal his hand, or bid 3@c and investigate. On this hand he chose the wrong one|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 3NT -1 in OR|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - Fantoni and Nunes also play a non-standard leading method|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: that what they said|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|dburn: but given that North has raised spades, he would certainly lead low from an honor and high from three small|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|gracelin: maybe in raised suit. Otherwise they lead low from odd with honor(or even without) and high even wit honor(or odd without)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: the contract was the same at the other table, and Sontag made it somehow|pg||
nt|gracelin: either a D or C lead will break the trump squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Greco interfered over the Sonty's 1@D negative  with DBL [presumably @H & @S]    Berkowitz in 5@C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, now I know how - the spade lead was allowed to run to declarer's ten, after which declarer played for the trump squeeze Patrick mentioned|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
mc|8|nt|gracelin: but north had many chances to break it.|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - "criss-cross squeeze" - but whatever it was, it was fancy stuff and well done by Sontag|pg||
pg||
qx|o35|st||md|1SQT963HK7DAJ5CAK3,SAK754HT3DKTCJT65,SJ8HQJ9642DQ874C4,S2HA85D9632CQ9872|sv|e|nt|lc: That ending is going in my article :)|pg||
nt|ritong: criss cross is a squeeze with blocked threats, joseph  for info:)|pg||
nt|lc: It could have been broken up, though.|pg||
nt|me argent: how about trick1?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lc: Well, trick 1 was mysterious.  I'll have to ask Fred why he played low.|pg||
mb|1N|an|Semi-Forcing|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lc: Gitelman has shape for 1NT opening, but probably deems the hand too good for 15-17 -- I agree.|pg||
nt|lc: Treats it as 18-19 balanced.|pg||
nt|me argent: even if partner has the 10 it seems wrong no?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|Transfer|nt|lc: Now, Moss should have a way to get out in 3@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: This is presumably it.  X-fer and then pass 3@H.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: Or maybe raise to 4?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: so much for pass |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: hi shirley|pg||
nt|lc: So, we've all been in worse games.  And this one isn't down quite yet.  Would like @DK onside, though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|me argent: game aint terrible except here|pg||
nt|lc: On quick glance, it seems Berk might have to play a @D through when he wins his @HA.|pg||
nt|lc: Still, lots of complication, since declarer can win @CAK and throw @S from dummy.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: he will|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||

nt|ritong: it can t|pg||

nt|ritong: gib plays a @s now i guess|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|lc: Sonty rates to flasecard the A here.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lc: He should have, anyway.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: agreed|pg||
nt|lc: Not likely East would underlead the ace.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: might have needed a @D  thru or now at least|pg||
nt|ritong: rather weird   alan is good at these things|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: among others|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: Careful @H9 by Gitelman.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry folks there was a revoke and I cannot play this anymore.|pg||
nt|ritong: but now he needs a good @d guess|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, he hasn't made it yet, has he?  If he plays a @D to the Jack won't he lose 2 @D tricks?|pg||
nt|ritong: sheesh|pg||
nt|ritong: a revoke...|pg||
nt|lc: Do you know what the revoke was?  (I need it for my report) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: lool|pg||
nt|me argent: @DQ would be a good shot|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, even the best players revoke.  And lead out of turn.  And all that other embarrassing stuff.|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent point joey|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, I like that @DQ play (to get 2 hand entries for proven ruffing @S finesse).|pg||
nt|lc: But all a moot point since there was a revoke.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Gitelman revoked on a high Heart. Berkowitz just realized it.|pg||
nt|me argent: who revoked?|pg||
mc|9|nt|lc: Tough break for DIAMOND team as they were about to win a swing and now will lose one (other table in 2@H).|pg||

mb|1N!|an|0-9|nt|dburn: this is a negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i would guess misclick |pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  4@h might have kept Platnick quiet|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C is not Gazzilli for this pair.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3@h apparently preemptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3h was alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what 3@s is|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 2+ @ds, 10-15|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: and this is a morph into a Standard-like forcing notrump auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  what is their 1NT range?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: it might, but that would not have been such a good idea - 4@h and 4@s both look down from here|pg||
nt|henryb:  from here too, David.|pg||
nt|dburn: 12-14|pg||
nt|poohbear: 12-14 often offshape|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 2@s= 4 cards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: W hand is limited to 15 hcps , thus the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3-3 @ds should be np to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: the trump suit is right for the Devil's Coup, but the rest of the hand is not diabolical at all - declarer just has a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  standard count/attitude  suit pref in trump  and Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: he must have discounted the Q@c..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Greco opened 1N [14-16]  that shut out EW  so  3@H South|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  In general, Meltzer's duck should suggest there is something she wants partner to lead|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: meltzer will go plus in both rooms -- and basically all they did was follow suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: this will be another 5-6 imps pick up for Meltzer|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  How did they not go down in 3@h?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: maybe they didn't follow suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: in effect, at the other table Moss opted for 4@h facing an 18-19 notrump opening|pg||
nt|gracelin: south only has 17, so he did not have his 2NT bid.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: wow -- i just assumed they would |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can ruff, draw trump, and run DQ to make 10 tricks now.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: now a @d to the 10|pg||

nt|lc: True -- he has gone wrong on all 3 deals.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: Presuming 3NT is a solid major, Berk will surely drive to 6@H at the least.|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Hs or 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is giving this call a lot of thought.|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt a usefull convention on this hand|pg||
nt|lc: He can expect that 7@H is on no worse than a finesse (assuming 3NT = solid major).|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ritong: if it shows a solid suit, berk has an obvious6@h call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: it does and berk decided to go lowish|pg||
nt|lc: If he thought it was a 5 or 7 hand (picture a @C lead and partner 2=7=2=2) it is better to be in 7  (makes 13 tricks with @DK on or 11 tricks with it off, but never 12).|pg||
nt|lc: But, that assumes a club lead and partner with a club loser and 2+@D.|pg||
nt|lc: So, I think 6@H is practical -- since other table could be in 4.|pg||
nt|ritong: he is declarer, larry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lc: Experts like to lead fromo kings on this kind of auction, but the QJ10 kind of jumps out at you.|pg||
nt|ritong: almost nothing bad can happen, thus|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.  I know he is declarer -- but still dummy could have @Cxx and @Dxx.|pg||
nt|lc: Oh yeah -- @C lead then helps get rid of @D loser.|pg||
nt|ritong: then you play on @cs not worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|lc: Good point.|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|lc: Like I said, I like 6@H.  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3NT always promises a least 7.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lc: Not as easy as it looks here.|pg||
nt|lc: Say he draws trump and plays a @D to Q and it holds.|pg||
nt|lc: Then what?|pg||
nt|lc: Not clear who has @DK -- South could easily duck.|pg||
nt|lc: No late entry to East's @D|pg||
nt|lc: So, likely to take ruffs and avoid that potential problem.|pg||
nt|me argent: it aint but cards are friendly so berk will have his work cut out for him if he wishes to go down|pg||
nt|lc: Ruffing back and forth looks to be the best shot.|pg||
nt|lc: But, anyway, that is why he is not playing quickly -- he is considering the options.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|me argent: harder now to go down|pg||
nt|lc: Apparently, Greco-Hampso have same 3NT opening and had same auction at other table.|pg||
nt|lc: This line did risk @DKxxxx offside.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: As far as what has been said about the 3NT is that it shows at least 7 solid hearts with only the need for at most one finesse.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lc: Deciding between a 99.4 and 99.5% line of play is not my idea of fun.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lc: Especially if you choose the 99.4 and it turns out you needed to choose the 99.5. :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|lc: When I was on the CAYNE team, in the 1990's, that always seemed to happen to me.  I'd choose an 86% line and the team coach would write up the notes and charge me with 26 IMPS ...|pg||
nt|lc: because there was an 86.1% line that would have worked.|pg||
nt|me argent: i think its a waste of energy to worry about such close decesions|pg||
nt|lc: Me too.|pg||
nt|me argent: for me at any rate|pg||
nt|lc: Life (and bridge) is too short.|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to pay for it sooner or later  so i agree|pg||
nt|lc: There are people who love to figure out these percentages and live for it, but that is not what bridge is about to me.|pg||
nt|me argent: im happy when i can hit on a 50% line of play|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: Larsen going for the grand?|pg||
mb|3N!|an|solid|nt|dburn: in fact, they did follow suit - but they followed suit to too many rounds of clubs and not enough rounds of spades in the early going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+bal|pg||

nt|warrens:  both pairs play this to show a solid major?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they are playing 6 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|gracelin: Greco may well bid it here too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so it seems - not unknown as a method, but odds against finding both pairs in a match playing it|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: and 11-15 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he did make a try for grand -- but settled in 6@S|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sybarra2: how does E know it is not spades? |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and same lead |pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: not an unfriendly lie of cards for Meltzer, but the entry position is not that great|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that @sA is what Sherlock would have described as a clue that partner does not have solid spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: you are right all,  ace of spades in E hand,  HAS to be hts|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, how should he play?|pg||
nt|gracelin: ruff two spades is a way for 12 tricks, Fnesse DK is another|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  you have to burn a @d trick, but not that hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some potential transportation problems|pg||
nt|dburn: may be best just to play a low heart from the table now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @Dx to hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: giving up on the chance of bringing in the whole suit, which she doesn't need in any case|pg||
nt|henryb:  could be wrong if East can win to play a spade.|pg||
nt|dburn: could be, but sometimes East doesn't go in with @hQ from Qx, for example|pg||
nt|henryb:  true enough|pg||
nt|dburn: but if that's how you;re going to play, better do it fast, or he will|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs should note that we try to comment on declarer thought process and she can't see all 4 hands|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: oops Irina|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: low with even cards|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can Diamond make this if he [eventually] finesses @HJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Peter :)|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Al and Hedy|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: instead she did it fairly slowly, but East couldn't even beat the @h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the @sJ was friendly in any case|pg||
nt|warrens:  I expect him to ruff a club, ruff a spade, ruff a club, ruff a spade, ruff a club and try to draw trump|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, guess that's what he will do.  Bt will reject the D finesse later to ensure 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: long week greco said and start to thk again|pg||
nt|dburn: odd, that - I'd have expected Fantoni to put the king on the second spade, just to sow doubt|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|henryb:  Diamond can save an imp by cashing out now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he need to?   i don't think declarer can score 4th @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if !AH @D return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably will - his last chance is that partner somehow has @sQ, although declarer would not play like this if he did|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  4@h, 3@d and 3@c = 10|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was about to say MAYBE if convinced @C4-2  he will conclude needs 4@H 3@C 2@D -- which means he would need @HQx or @HQxx|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like South will be endplayed to give a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: endplay for 8th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: little does he know he's in  great shape   Meltzer in 5@S and bidding isn't over|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|me argent: if i intended to bid again i would stayman|pg||
nt|me argent: if not then i pass|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|lc: It is sort of "2 out of 3" in that you can handle 2@H or 2@D, but yes, my partner's, too always bid @S.  (Statistically more likely than him hitting my 4-card suit, I know).|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fantoni thot about t/o|pg||

pc|c4|nt|hedyg: no voids, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with both majors ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: you easily miss 2 M opposite weak pd |pg||
nt|hedyg: here 3@H shows maximum, i.e. 15|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: by that i meant  Negative DBL over 1@H shows 4@S|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol he can try|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: so IF he had tried DBL  there was risk that Meltzer could bid 1@S with only 3|pg||
nt|dburn: this kind of thing is why many players nowadays use double to show spades and 1@s to deny them (or vice versa, of course)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: possibly a more effective style than playing double to show four spades, 1@s to show five|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: now they just have to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: so I will trust the scores entered by our indefatigable operators - you can make up your own minds :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: note Platnick DBL instead of 1@S   many north americans would bid 1@S  [and if wrong, we'd blame Eric Kokish]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kokish popularized the idea of higher limit [bordering on no limit] overcalls|pg||
nt|henryb:  Might have felt strong enough to X and then bid 2@s, and worried that 1@s would get passed out when more is possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inv minor for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that 1N goes up to 11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gives DBL more of a true takeout nature than the original   DBL = support for other suits OR 1-suit too good for mere overcall|pg||
nt|dburn: will be surprised at the response, but may have overreacted to it - if this asks for heart control, Diamond will bid a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S ask for @H control  might get them to 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David typed faster|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if Larsen leads a diamond he will make one, but...|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: @HA or @CQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: or q of dia?|pg||
nt|dburn: @cQ is pretty dangerous - that might be dummy's side suit|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, a diamond isn't totally out of the question - @hA will just set up declarer's king|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it turns out that a diamond blows a trick, it may not be the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then @Dx vs @DQ    small is a bit of a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer will run a low diamond - how many points is North supposed to have, after all?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking low @C could [keyword] come from @DQxxx(s)  so Meltzer could hold @DJ|pg||

nt|lc: Terrible result for @D in Closed.  |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|me argent: even playing weak nt i still open 1@S|pg||

nt|me argent: in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lc: Moss will soon regret not opening 4@S -- he has let E-W in.  But, surely not a clear 4@S opening.|pg||

nt|me argent: except for fantoni|pg||

nt|me argent: berk will now bid 5@Ds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: I wonder what Gitelman was planning to bid if it went 2@h P P dbl|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lc: Yeah, a Master Solver's problem.  Maybe 3@H or 4@C|pg||
nt|lc: Gitleman must be amused by all this bidding.|pg||
nt|lc: Now what?  5@S?  Pass?  Double?|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that Double is the winner (the defense for -1 looks fairly routine).|pg||
nt|ritong: EW seem to have ten @ds|pg||
nt|lc: I'll bet if he knew his partner had @CJxxxx he would bid on.|pg||
nt|ritong: ditto|pg||

nt|lc: I don't blame him.  Tough problem.|pg||
nt|ritong: very|pg||
nt|lc: I'll predict 5@S.|pg||

nt|me argent: 1@S leads to a scientific auction unfortunately both sides get to use science|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: but i know i could never bring myself to open 4@Ss with that north hand|pg||
nt|lc: Might Berk lead @DQ and shift to @C?  Far from clear.|pg||
nt|lc: Not an easy lead problem at all.|pg||
nt|ritong: the auction is highly unusual|pg||
nt|lc: I always cite Garozzo's rule:  "When a singleton is at all possible, lead it."|pg||
nt|lc: Is it at all possible here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz reached for the K of hearts and is now reconsidering.|pg||
nt|ritong: he might take time to try to get why south came alive after having passed 2@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: might be the only way to beat it|pg||
nt|me argent: brutal lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lc: Just a matter of -1 or -2.|pg||
nt|ritong: and probably will conclude that south had a penalty double for @hs|pg||
nt|lc: Should be read as a singleton based on East's bidding @H then 5@D.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lc: Easpecially with the @C32 in dummy, this has to be a singleton (can't be from xxx on the auction -- and would be a bizarre lead even if so).|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Berk in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: 1nt here better  raise to 2h|pg||
nt|dburn: that's why the moderns overcall so often instead of doubling - they need double to show a balanced twelve count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Irina|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: fantunes 2@S opener is 10-13 unbal, but cannot include 4+@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: two spades? well, that is treating partner's double with proper disrespect, I guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: if u only see EW-cards - then 4@h looks like an easy game: 2@d-losers abd a doublefines in @h - but...........|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: dir not let him and that for good|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of 3@C vs 3@H|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy for West to give his partner a ruff|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|dburn: but he can cash a diamond and, just maybe, learn enough to play a club then|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will West believe partner is leading a singleton and declarer has a hidden 5-card suit?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know - might depend on whether partner thought I could be 3-6 in hearts and clubs|pg||

nt|bigtrain: plays the 2 and it's champange for the tab;e|pg||

nt|dburn: not that game is a wonderful spot, but I guess that on this lie, if declarer had stuck in the jack of hearts and played @sA and another, North would have been endplayed|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dburn: normal enough for Platnick to remove to 4@h, but that would not have been the winner on a spade lead - still, how could South lead a spade?|pg||

nt|dburn: at the other table on the same diamond lead, declarer chose to play three rounds of clubs pitching a spade from the table|pg||
nt|dburn: but then he played ace and a heart, undoing the good work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question posed    "if @HQ hand lost to @HK -- how would declarer get back to dummy safely?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: need to cash sp now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or would he just try to drop doubleton @HJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only an overtrick imp in play at this point -- guessing the trump play already secured double digit swing|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: 4th Best and Smith Echo for Sontag and Berkowitz.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lc: led|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lc: Good composure by Moss here to dig in. Tendancy is to play quickly and get to next deal the way things have been going -- and not give this any study.|pg||
nt|lc: The most difficult thing in bridge is to dig in when you are getting drilled.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lc: Easy to let it get totally out of control psychologically.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|lc: This is still a very close match and Gitelman-Moss need to get into their A-mode -- it can turn around easily enough.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S!|nt|dburn: probably not pass - would expect 1@s, a kind of negative double denying spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yesterday a set ended with hand where opener held  9@H missing only the Jack|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c was a strong no trump or better, or 15+ with clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: 2@C here is 8+ minors...  might even be 5-3 either way|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: if he was only missing the jack, he must have had twelve hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 8 card suits are mundane :)|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunate lie of cards|pg||
nt|po-s: third heart gets ruffed but with SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Great Shuffler could have provided @H3-3 instead|pg||
nt|dburn: frustrating for Larsen, but he has at least the consolation of reflecting that it is just as irritating for Hampson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different than after 1@H response because opener might hold  1@S 4@H 3@D 5@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for those asking...  the last hand he treated the singleton K as a balanced hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this one with a small singleton is different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- correct me if i'm wrong [as always]   they can do this with 3@D 5@C  because of the 1@D-2@H/@S responses showing 5@S & 4+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: and 1S a negative double without 4+ spades ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, but brad is creative, not nuts|pg||
nt|lc: I might devalue the hand to a 15-17 notrump with the lack of spots and the QJ doubleton, but 1@H is the normal bid.|pg||
nt|lc: Using Bergen raises, where 3@H is weak, South could try that call.|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Weak Raise|nt|me argent: in a minor i would bid 1nt but 1@H if majour|pg||
nt|lc: Many always ask me about Bergen raises -- my opinion: If you thoroughly agree and discuss them (on/off in comp, PH, etc.) they are okay to play.|pg||
nt|lc: If you play them casually without discussion, better off not bothering.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: This strikes me as a strange way to do it -- since with the weak, you want to take up the most space (3@H not 3@C and let them in).|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lc: I would play X of 3@C as lead-directing.  I gues Sontag-Berkowitz don't.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|poohbear: Most everyone plays dbl of 3@c take out these days|pg||

nt|me argent: i like simplicity so X 4 me is always TO in these situations|pg||
nt|lc: Oh  thanks -- now I don't have to click Movie, etc.|pg||
nt|lc: I like simplicity, so X is always Lead directional.|pg||

nt|lc: A promotion, I suppose -- not an uppercut.  But I don't mean to get technical.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lc: So, @HA and a @H and West goes to @SK and the get @DA and then another @S promotes @H10 for setting trick.|pg||

nt|poohbear: Perhaps declarer need to cut some communications before playing trumps?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  names not entered in profiles   around the table  N:Kyle  E:Brian  S:Rose  W:John|pg||
nt|gracelin: north may go to 4H if his spade Q, J were a King.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: doubt that North is thinking, but East may wonder whether he's being stolen from (as might West have done)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|dburn: he could bid 3@s now, which would inferentially be four spades and a longer minor, but it's a big position|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  43 another 12 imp pickup for Meltzer  where Fantoni made 3@S   Berkowitz made 4@HX|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Then 2@S by South.|pg||
nt|lc: Will WEst venture in?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Honestly, I would have acted with Sontag's hand over 2@S, knowing opps have 8+@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: wold you larry?|pg||
nt|lc: However, if I had a partner dumb enough to be 2-2 in my suits, I would pass.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lc: Still, I am quite sure it was percentage action to come in.|pg||
nt|lc: E-W could have easily had a huge fit in @C or @H -- and N-S could have even had 9@S between them.|pg||
nt|lc: It only looks bad/dumb/dangerous because we are looking at East's 4=2=5=2 shape.  Now you know why I stopped playing with David. :)|pg||
nt|me argent: could not north have a @S dirth larry?|pg||
nt|ritong: you also look at the fact that north has no @s singleton|pg||

nt|poohbear: dearth isnt it?|pg||
nt|lc: BBO doesn't have spell-check, but I knew what he meant.|pg||
nt|lc: But, to answer the question, they couldn't have a "dearth" since they had to have at least an 8-fit.|pg||

nt|ritong: anyway, to answer joey, sonty has single @s, east cannot have 5, so they have a real fit|pg||
nt|lc: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dearth|pg||
nt|lc: When partner opens a minor, and you have a singleton major :  Make a mental note that opponents have an 8+ card major fit and your job is that they don't play in 2 of that major.|pg||
nt|ritong: that s what i meant with " you look at the fact" etc|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Meltzer did not open weak 2@D - so this auction probably implies @H tolerance|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d!|nt|lc: As to South "following the LAW" and bidding 4@S...|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: From the best side, but still looks like a trick short for a make -- unless misdefense.|pg||
nt|lc: Will North panic after high spade lead and shift to club?  He shouldn't.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sontag is wondering why they did not double 4S low and behold he is not aware that 4S has play.|pg||
nt|lc: More than play...it is cold.  :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|lc: Anyway, after likely @SA lead, Moss can likely figure declarer's approximate shape to see that a @C shift is not neccesary.|pg||
nt|lc: But, Gitelman's card here should surely be S.P.|pg||
nt|lc: Might he play the @S2 to suggest a @C card?|pg||
nt|dburn: impressive, that - I thought Greco did very well to bid over 4@s on a not dissimilar auction at the other table, and I was thinking that would be a big swing to Diamond|pg||
nt|lc: That could be the key to beating the hand from Gitelman's viewpoint if his partner has, say the @CK and 1 side trick.|pg||
nt|lc: Unfortunately, there is a lot to think about on this Trick 1 signal -- and it is a very tempo-sensitive situation.|pg||
nt|lc: What if he plays a SLOW @S2 now, and North doesn't shift to clubs?|pg||
nt|lc: E-W will claim foul.|pg||
nt|lc: They will say: "After a fast -- or in-tempo @C2, North would bang down @CA."  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lc: A slow @S2 might be the @CQ.  A fast @S2 is the @CK.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: On 45  Moss also in 3@H   i thought he might [keyword] downgrade the hand and open 15-17 NT which would allow them to play 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but tendency seems to be    never downgrade -- sometimes upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: wrong sides hearts bid|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: strange texas transfer with only 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: Fontoni-Nunes are not known for their speed - but we are 4 boards ahead of OR|pg||
nt|pelu: best to duck - or knock out @CA first |pg||
nt|pelu: often N will have 2 Aces - but he is lucky here - the problem with the duck is, that S - if @DA in N can attack that suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would help declarer to know @CAx instead of @CAxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter - do you see any reason to guess this hand correctly?|pg||
nt|pelu: the only clue is the X from S - with only 2@s's a good chance that S has 2 of the missing Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: crikey - that was a good view|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: cl lead makes easy after 5 dia|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra2: french flag other direction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: only 5@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oops sorry |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|gracelin: no double, no trouble.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|me argent: 4@Ss over 3@Ds would have been clearer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|po-s: but not very suitable for NT play|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Hs |pg||
nt|dburn: I guess Platnick took the view that 4@s was his side's most likely game - but that does seem a bit unilateral|pg||

nt|poohbear: why wouldnt he underlead the @c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: his play was auto and to give him credit he knew it|pg||
nt|dburn: because his partner might have had a singleton|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: But really the wrong bridge play -- but the right ethical play.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: of course, he "knew" his partner didn't have a singleton, or @s2 would have come faster, but as Larry says, you have to play by the rules|pg||
nt|me argent: didnt partner tell him to? so he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lc: But on the auction, a @C play was so unlikley to be needed.|pg||
nt|me argent: these boys are very ethical|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|warrens:  no way to get to 3nt now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 3NT just on likely @D guess.|pg||
nt|me argent: what a horror this has been for NS so very very painfull|pg||
nt|ritong: good thing this segment is over|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: But, with 400 here, they could leave with a little momentum.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Quite likely to guess the @D.|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, he bid it anyway.  |pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|lc: Restricted choice and the auction.|pg||
nt|lc: (East has @H length, so more likely to be short in @D).|pg||
nt|me argent: a little bread for the @D team would be nice|pg||
nt|warrens:  I guess he knew his partner had to have something|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  in @C's|pg||
nt|lc: So, @D will gain back 7 and after this slaughter be down by only a very managable 17 in the match.|pg||
nt|ritong: scoring a goal at the last minute is always good  i said that yesterday, but it was next to last board  and on the last board  my guys goofed:) i do not tell you the avalanche of ...|pg||
nt|ritong: private sneering|pg||
nt|dburn: it's not as if they're on Skid Row, Joey - 18 behind with 16 to play isn't a case for a government bailout|pg||
nt|lc: Unless, of course, he misguesses @D.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|me argent: good lead by berk not that it will make much difference|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lc: Restricted choice:  http://www.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=103|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: As expected Moss is giving this serious thought.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Maybe searching for a little more distributional info before the big @D play.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: trying to get a honest count in @ss|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: I'll bet he gets it right.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|lc: If nothing else, he deserves a reward for his ethics on the previous deal.|pg||
nt|lc: But, the way this set has been going....|pg||
nt|dburn: no time to overthink|pg||
nt|me argent: hampstead|pg||
nt|lc: Yes David.  All odds, clues, everything -- leads to finessing.  (And really easy when we can see the cards). :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: what if throw @sQ on @sA?|pg||
nt|lc: Sexy.  I like it!|pg||
nt|lc: But, then declarer can play another @S.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer could maybe play some more spades|pg||
nt|lc: And figure out the reason for the falsecard.|pg||
nt|dburn: but then he might wonder whether you were pretending to have short spades, or only pretending to be pretending to have short spades...|pg||
nt|caitlin: I will testify as someone who teaches online Larry has abundance of great articles at larryco.com..!!:)|pg||
nt|lc: If he goes wrong, it is down 4 and 7 IMPs the other way.  So, 14 Imps hang on this play.|pg||
nt|me argent: NEXT|pg||
nt|lc: NEXT will be in about 10-15 minutes.  The final 16 deals of the 2010 Spingold.|pg||
nt|lc: But, will the margin be 17 (likely?) or 31 (unlikely)?|pg||
nt|lc: For those who missed it... Seeding rights are relevant here.|pg||
nt|dburn: and will it be in ten minutes (likely) or will Moss still be sitting here trying to guess diamonds (more likely)?|pg||
nt|lc: If MELTZER has the choice, they will keep this matchup.|pg||
nt|lc: If DIAMOND has the rights, they will switch.|pg||
nt|lc: At least, that is how it goe 90% of the time.|pg||
nt|lc: Sometimes egos prevail, and the pair that got killed insists on going back for revenge against the pair that killed them.|pg||
nt|me argent: someone tell moss that life is a timed event|pg||
nt|poohbear: still prob has a few minutes on the clock|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not many|pg||
nt|lc: In the Spingold, at the start of the match, the higher seeded team (the lowest  ) get to choose if they want seeding right ini segments 1 & 4 or 2 & 3.|pg||
nt|lc: Usually they take 2 & 3.|pg||
nt|lc: Here, DIAMOND was the  1 seed, and I'd guess they took 2 & 3.  |pg||
nt|me argent: when i get butchered (as often happens)  i like to change things arround|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss is still in the tank about this one. |pg||
nt|lc: Which would mean MELTZER has the choice in the 4th and would keep this postioning.|pg||
nt|lc: We soon will see.|pg||
nt|lc: When playing with Bergen, he once got to this position and thought it 50-50. He took out the @DA and @D10 in his hand, shuffled them upside down and turned one over and played it.|pg||
nt|caitlin: your opinion not mine:)|pg||
nt|lc: (he was wrong).  :(|pg||
nt|poohbear: I suspect that's correct as Meltzer prob would have played Fantoni Nunes against @d platnick in the 2nd if given the choice|pg||
nt|dburn: they may have to stop using the clock and start using the calendar|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol sounds like Marty!!|pg||
nt|lc: For 16 deals with screens, normal time alotment is 160 minutes. They are at 168 now.|pg||
nt|lc: Normal is 140, I mean.|pg||
nt|lc: They are at 148.|pg||
nt|lc: And Sonty used 3 of them.|pg||
nt|me argent: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: he probably had a headache|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: They still have 7 minutes on the clock that I can see.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Berk isnt exactly slow|pg||
mc|9|nt|me argent: :):)|pg||
nt|lc: 17 it is.  As we thought all along.  |pg||
nt|poohbear: maybe the VG operator was just torturing us?|pg||
nt|lc: Have fun in the 4th everyone.  Thanks for watching.  |pg||
nt|ritong: ty larry  merci a tous|pg||
nt|lc: Thank you all.|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Larry!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: thenbest chance is to duck and hope that S will play another @S|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: last board of the set     after break of unknown length  16 boards to determine the 2010 Spingold Champs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfd: i would open Kyle hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|po-s: if partner can not possibly know what is expected from him re bilateralism, I think unilateralism is best|pg||
nt|ritong: would you try to bother big @c auction with south' hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: sure|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat vul 1N opening is a point stronger than 1st/2nd/3rd not-vul|pg||
mb|2H|nt|po-s: Kyle may have a fair idea about Rose´s point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, roze said she get bored after she wend down in 3 dia|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@d again 14+ with diamonds, forcing|pg||

mb|3H|nt|pelu: can u tell ud Irina - what happened in trick 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: duck duck duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's the line    pause, claim and let opp work it out :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: apart from that, everyone displaying a commendable tendency to bid what they've got|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can bid 4D and guess trumps for 130 or defend 3H for 100|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|ritong: she s apparently steaming, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=18-19|pg||
