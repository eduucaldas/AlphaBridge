nt|lc: Very important to discuss with your partner what 2@D by North would be the first time.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Interesting about that - yesterday, vs. Versace-Lauria, who open 1@c on 2 only with 4432, Hampson-Greco discussed playing 1@c-2@c as natural and decided not to, but I didn't hear ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: any discussion about 1@d-2@d today|pg||
nt|lc: So, is Greco considering 3NT?|pg||
nt|warrens:  Larry, do you normally play 2@D in this sequence as natural?  I would.|pg||
nt|me argent: i lke 2 play the non Q bid ie when opponents bid 2 different suits when i bid one of them its natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he's definitely considering :)|pg||
nt|lc: With a likely @S lead, 3NT is a make.|pg||
nt|lc: It seems that it takes a @C lead to beat 3NT (declarer has to hold up, then @S switch).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: One expert pair I know plays it as natural and 2@h as Michaels "only if discussed before the session starts"|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Berk asking questions - just asked whether 1@d-2@d would be natural and I think that Greco said it would be - then he explained something about this auction - I heard the word ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: "hearts" but not sure what else he said|pg||
nt|me argent: playing non Q bids is especially usefull playing against zia types|pg||
nt|lc: If Berk knew opps had 10@D, he surely would compete to 3@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: N-S can easily make 4@D -- a little harder to tell how E-W do in @S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Another chance for Greco to try 3NT. :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, now 3NT would show some doubt, allowing partner to pull with a minimum|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I think he is going to score 400.  @C lead unlikely.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Make that 550.  But he could run.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|lc: So, Sontag's X seems to have created -130 instead of -400 -- although I doubt that is what he had in mind.|pg||
nt|me argent: i think sonty doubledbecause he knew they would run a sorts safety play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Greco asks about the 2@d overcall over 1@d and they agree it's Michaels (I must have misunderstood earlier) and 3@d over 1@d would be Intermediate|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sometimes I don't see spots because they're turned too quickly and just play the lowest, but this time Hampson did play the deuce, probably hoping to signal for clubs|pg||
nt|lc: But, that doesn't mean the defense will routinely work it out.|pg||
nt|lc: But, maybe the @H2 was just upside-down count to show 2,4, or 6 hearts.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: very true - all I know is that I actually saw the 2, didn't guess as I sometimes have to|pg||
