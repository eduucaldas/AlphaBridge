nt|Walddk2: Do you all agree with passing 3@C?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would correct to spades|pg||

nt|pelu: in Open Beatty-Jacobs are NS - the 3. pair on the team are Bocchi-ferraro, Italy|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund, Bill Frisby and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it was a bad idea to pre-empt with west's very balanced hand - it might push opps into a making 4@S they weren't going to bid on their own|pg||
nt|dima:  So some action with a Polish club I suppose on the board N1|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure south will feel able to bid that 5-card suit yet again :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Well Apolinary might guess that partner is short in @h, but how many @s will he have?|pg||
nt|dima:  Certainly not 3 (would raise) ...|pg||
nt|pelu: with all suit almost 3-3, only a @s-lead can defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|dima:  Actually 4@h bid now as DO SMTH clever could be ok :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, you can often use a cue-bid as a choice of games bid in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|dima:  Discipline won|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|dima:  And it is clear even if undiscussed since 3@s was nonforcing|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dima:  Well looks like first blood to Jacobs (4 IMPs)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps south should just have passed 3@H out - his partner, known to be short in hearts, didn't act over 3@H, so must be very weak|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: not easy though with three small facing the assumed singleton|pg||

nt|caitlin: 3N  N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I think N/S is discussing a defence to E/W 2@D opening or something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can see 8 tricks in notrumps, it will take time to set up a 9th|pg||
nt|caitlin: spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, about 5 minutes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: finessing Ten|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: You are one tempo behind on a diamond lead. I think clubs offer the best chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may be enough|pg||
nt|caitlin: so puppet stayman asks ps for 5 card major--3N obviously denies 4 or 5 cd major|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dima:  oops|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|pelu: he found the loosing line :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing for a third club trick isn't bad odds with that suit, a priori|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect he was afraid of 5-3 diamonds or the overcaller having both high hearts|pg||
nt|dima:  this would win on any 3-3 or H singleton or doubleton by West|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 break or catching a doubleton club honour with west|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|athene: playing hearts towards the @HQJ works better of course but declarer might be thinking west is very likely to hold @HAK since he hasn't got much of a spade suit|pg||
nt|dima:  If @d are 5-3 then heart honor position is not relevant, no?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|mc|8|nt|athene: yes, diamonds 5-3 is another reason to play clubs instead|pg||

nt|caitlin: 4@S easy here|pg||
nt|reisig: easy?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Proving that the text-books are right when they say: To make 3NT you need 25 points. |pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: In 3NT no Board 2, Sadek led the @D9 and declarer continued with ace, king and another club. Does not seem the best start.|pg||

nt|athene: 4@S puts a lot of pressure on east - i certainly wouldn't want to pass this out with his hand|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@H looks the normal action|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Money for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|athene: north even with a spade fit of course just takes the money|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dima:  I think every redblooded bridge player would bid with East hand ... but I've been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3-3-3 hands aren't meant to bid 5 over 5 with, especially when you have all your strength in defensive tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question is really whether 4@s is normal. If not, then this may be a win for Markowitz|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|pelu: so looks like 800 +50 for Jacobs|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dima:  4@s does look a bit offbeat to me with 7222|pg||
nt|athene: i like 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: often good to pretend to be weak defensively when you are not|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience when one table opens 1major and the other opens 4, the one who opened high almost always gains|pg||
nt|pelu: green against red - OK for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Markowicz is back in the match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this vuls i check in the dark when partner opens 4@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: north's correct action over 4@S is not just to pass, but to pass instantly, looking bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S = 7 playing tricks - thats almost the S-hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same as check in the dark :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Klukowski was surprisingly passive at the other table: overcalled 3@h and then passed throughout|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm that's a strange switch, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has got busy for no reason however|pg||
nt|athene: why not just cash your hearts and exit a spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash hearts, exit spades was the indicated defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be right, we agree|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was playing his partner for a singleton or void diamond|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|s5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: well, turning a phantom 1100 into 800 is hardly the sort of defensive slip to keep you awake at nights|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: unless you are a real purist|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

nt|brolucius: been a strip squeeze on East.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South is a bit annoyed about how East has been counting his cards when a new board is played|pg||
nt|brolucius: The run of declarer's trumps would force East to keep @HQ-x-x accompanied by only two winners in the minors. He could then be thrown on lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: (has been discussed from 1st board)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So South has called the director to do something about it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can he see that when East is on the other side of the screen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: South is saying "if I can see his cards when he counts his cards then his partner can too"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe no screens, that would explain it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: There are no screens currently|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Screens will be in use from tomorrow I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Kowalski went down in 3NT on Board 2, playing clubs instead of hearts to seek his ninth trick.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was another 12 IMPs away.|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c maybe checkback here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|reisig: Well ...Pass wasn't|pg||

nt|reisig: Pass was the one call ..I never considered|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: I mentioned a short while ago that text-books recommended you are in 3NT with 25 points. |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: The good news for EW is that 4@S would go down. The bad news is that 3NT will make|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: I'm sure there is a good reason for passing partner's 2NT but I cannot think of it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The jump 2NT rebid is usually made on 18-19 (with 15-17 you either open 1NT or rebid 1NT). So, West was worth going to game with 7 points to add to the pot. |pg||

nt|Walddk2: East misjudged on board 3 in the other room, but he was under a lot of pressure after South opened 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Markowitz is seeded 27 and they have some big names from Poland in their squad.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: No, indeed. 5@H was fine. He was forced to guess as you say. Players prefer to play the hand rather than defend.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, he would be unlikely to play south for @SAK and a side ace as well, i guess|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dima:  Especially seeing @c Q coming down so it is not even close to a guess|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt likely to make here, but a million losers in the 6-2 spade fit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: need good methods here to avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR EW stopped in the "impossible" contract: 2NT (in teams)|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 3NT denies 4@h and 3@s|pg||
nt|dima:  So the spotlight is on Tarek Sadek|pg||
nt|henryb:  I see four of them. Where are the other 999,996?|pg||
nt|athene: west will be worried that his hand simply isn't enough help if spades aren't trumps...he doesn't know about his partner's secret weapon (diamond trick source)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still 3@D is a bit sounder, i would be worried about hearts with east hand|pg||
nt|dima:  I believe they play 3NT rebid here as VERY strong suggestion to play|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it helps to leave partner room to bid his hand, and that is another reason for 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: most people play 1x - 1y; 3NT as long solid or nearly solid suit with some stoppers|pg||
nt|pelu: some wopuldbid 3Nt here: = strong hand with long @d|pg||
nt|dima:  Not the first time I was wrong :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: i think West in the other room took a very odd view to pass 2nt - it's unlikely to be the right spot when you have that hand|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he didn't have the methods to stop in 3@S, which he might have wanted to do|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT is a bid - not a contract :)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|caitlin: regarding responding to 1NT (15-17)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C showed diamonds, I am told (by two VERY reliable kibitzers).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it quite common nowadays to play transfers over a take-out double. Partner will often just honor the transfer and then you get the chance to make a second bid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: All you give up, usually, is a natrual 1NT response. That is a useful bid, yes, but transfers are more useful and you get several of them in exchange.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|caitlin: one round yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nearly all the bridge magazine expert-panel systems say that a chance of suit should be 'constructive but non-forcing'. In other words it is not a rescue-bid.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Why ask that? If they have failed to alert some bid, that is their look-out.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|dima:  So last boards of the segments - we have seen very solid bridge by Sadek-Elahmady (as usual one almost want to add)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: strange 3Nt by Kowalski with 4 card @h?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dima:  4333 is a percentge for polish players|pg||
nt|athene: he has 4333; it's not a bad shot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the hearts dont bother me but the two unstopped suits do|pg||
nt|dima:  Defence tends to miscount/misplace cards|pg||
nt|dima:  Equivalent to 1NT (weak) - 3NT but one might consider positional values ...|pg||
nt|pelu: or he is still a little shaken after the misplay in 6@s|pg||

nt|fabsayc: in polish club makes more sense than in standard however|pg||

mc|8|nt|pelu: I know - we lost to Poland in Oostende (12-18) and missed the gold with 6VP :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ironic that hearts proved to be the weakness in 3NT|pg||
nt|dima:  it is :)|pg||
nt|dima:  well thanks all see you another time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not quite chagas pace, but a pleasant change from the usual painfully slow|pg||
