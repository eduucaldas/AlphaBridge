nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|d6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Hello all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can that X be a payout?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: yes but a sound contract.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: look like 3nt -1 from 4@D and 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.gabrial-ui.com/|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT e/w makes on guessing the spade position     |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Friendly placement of cards for the contract but 4@H imo a better contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  some communication issues|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 4th suit GF|pg||
nt|mcarroll: it will be very tight|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: I prefer 3@S after 4thsuit with such quality spades   also conveys shortage in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can't see any cards then the played. Will go out and come back:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re all. |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpm: thinking..|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No red card?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Morning all|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: if they err into grand will come out smelling of roses|pg||
nt|ady: the double fit makes the play simple|pg||
nt|haans: but what suit is trumf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Can you beat it - wait and see|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: if not leading a heart  thenQ@C seems the more natural lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: But on after that lead.|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes odd to lead Ace v NT|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|lml: good evening from Toronto|pg||

nt|ady: great and fortunate start for Rytal|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: Now has 9 tricks playing top @H.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjq: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: of course West is actually Gordon from Canada|pg||
nt|lml: this is a four man team and even though they are tired they didnt have time to fly anybody in |pg||
nt|garnetts: This will will not make  North happy--but Most likely 4@S will go down |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||
nt|lml: I believe Balcombe and Taylor have been in every set of the whole event as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: New @H? Nope|pg||
nt|rodal f: Free for a @S hook and @D play now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if a new @H came?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 3NT always is flat. Even by the best lead. @C.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: AK @D, @C to Ace, @Druff, @SA|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|ady: now making 11 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|2D|an|5+!D and 4 Major|mb|p|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4ST984HKT2DAK542CA,SAJ5HAJ764DJCJT96,SQ2H953DQ8763CKQ5,SK763HQ8DT9C87432|sv|n|nt|lml: this hand will not be played at the 1 level|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pace so far.|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that would be the normal way to do it in Indonesia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For a start in this session, a marginal @C slam will be played in a peaceful 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well played - I hope|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hans I am also still not awake - even after the early session, I just noticed that E is not on lead so the "automatic" @D lead is not a given :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Pass - Pass - Pass - and silalahi will bid ??|pg||
nt|josj: yesterday and this morning all teams played a Swiss for 7 rounds; the top 8 qualify for a round robin that finishes tomorrow afternoon|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS turn for 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Whatever that 2@S means its not my idea of a weak bid --too much defence |pg||
nt|ady: spades 2-2   so 4@S on for n/s|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|mamos:  hello|pg||
nt|haans: not that clear what to do|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcwla: A slightly heavy 4@S does the trick here of keeping @H's out of the picture.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And 100 is cheap against 620|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 150 sorry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Rolanbd :)|pg||
nt|josj: Roland|pg||
nt|josj: sry|pg||
nt|ady: best lead is a club   but defence then will get 2 clubs and a diamond    heart loser goiing on the diamonds    if a heart is led  then 11 tricks   both clubs go away on the ...|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the @C-lead against 3 NT, if East is declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  unlikely to make  even guessing well in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid imo.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont know their system, precision or standard|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  - and against 1 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: N. What are NS gona do here? 3NT is near now. But anyway the partscore.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Hard cards it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As to play?|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos:  certainly to play  expect itt  to be bid|pg||

nt|mamos:  misunderstanding?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as that moysany ain't gona work. Next.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E will be disappointed to find all finesses working|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Requires some play to make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't think N/S will usu be left to play quietly in 4@H; the comparison may be between 150 and 500.|pg||
nt|haans: we all have missed better games|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT  n/s   an unlikely contract  though would make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Jones Karwur according to the profile|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@D probably the Muiderberg style, 5Major and 4 + minor|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos:  we'll see : )|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play club now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos:  I think club players would bid 3NT  not sure that would work either|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: 2@S sorry|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S made the trial bid of 2@S looking for a check and N took it natural.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Did S have max for his NT bid? (12-14)?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: solid game, makes 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: so may be a swing for E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if in open room the contract will be 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Ostergaardv tells he nearly lead ac - but still it was only nearly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry some tech pb|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@D non-GF, on a hideous suit, combined with an indeterminate 2@S and a pass on a dime -- this seemingly cannot be where it's at.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
nt|shevek: guess it was ok both previous hands to open 10 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: as long as pd knows (part of the sys)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i thought tyne one spade opener was a little unbalanced in a different sense|pg||

nt|jcwla: Now lots of points but...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: indeed carl|pg||
nt|haans: long way to slamn here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Michael Askgaard started to play in the international field with the year 2000 Antalya Turkiye, then 2001 Mangaritaba, 2003 Monte Carlo, 2006 Verona, 2007 Antalya and Shanghai, ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2009 Sanremo, finally Ostend 2010 |pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: here 4@H down because the ruff in @d is obliged to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well the heart interfernce will give the auction momentum|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead and down|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT = "You don't know this, partner, but they pay a vul game bonus."  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KQ2+K75+J92+K982 |pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can be 2 down because for North it easy the lead with A@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||
nt|haans: right play|pg||
nt|haans: have no spade count|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: 4@C IS STANDOUT - how can west pass - momma mia|pg||
nt|shevek: it's ok Peter, you're doing a wonderful job :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: and did Clemmensen have full control of the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D 3@D to the return @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: after umpteen roujnds of bidding of course|pg||
nt|shevek: as operator you are supposed to wait for both screenmates to bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

nt|haans: Hansen may have seen p bid before|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: only bec IMP,,,|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and Kare Gjaldbaek, the most experienced player at the table. 96-01 Cardiff Schools, Juniors Mangaritaba 01, Torquay 02, Paris 03, Prague and istanbul 04, Riccione 05, University ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: teams in tranjin 06, Antalya 07 Open, Shanghai 07 Transnational teams|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now an easy grand slam to *play*, but to bid .....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to think really big thoughts.  |pg||
nt|ady: if this is bif in OR   will lose imps  that was likely gained on first board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 4@H   by west through a transfer|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
nt|josj: the EW hands fit the EW team's name very well: May Good Things Happen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Major battle|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were 25th before the last qualifying round and still got through!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.inabridge.com/|pg||
nt|josj: that's 1 good thing already, then :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Martha Stewart says, it's a good thing!|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a premium for some?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: played by east 4@H goes down on a club lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A "grown uo"- 4 @H|pg||
mb|4C|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D must be the lightest overcall this century|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West passed??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this auction, back to bed|pg||
nt|josj: if 2@C is Precision, that pass is a real surprise|pg||
nt|josj: East will certainly bid on...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @H slam on|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even the @C make the premium.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
nt|rodal f: As @C wich is nearest now.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is going on?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: opening with a flat 11 count becoming more prevalent|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT was a little joke|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is and they still get to non making games--combined 23 counts--which even the world's best card players cannot make |pg||
nt|don_kapu: depend how to manage not loose 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT also makes |pg||
mb|7C|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
nt|jcwla: When you think of the hands that a precision 2@C could be bid on, W cannot possibly think has described this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is a joke|pg||
nt|jcwla: How do you really feel, Roland? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A brave man - but he is right|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why didn't W answer the 4NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: OOPS|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is but if Precision the hand is way too good for it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  bets on 3@H?|pg||
nt|josj: I bet it was Precision (but not quite...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like playing grand slams in game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, this does not bode well for MGTH -- a little bit of almost humorous interference and they've stopped a level short of what we could have expected and two levels short of what ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: we might have hoped.|pg||
nt|josj: 13 tricks and next board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rule No. One - never rise 6 to 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: W got payed for that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Rule NO. two. Answer when ure pard ask?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos:  no   oooh ugly|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hi|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: The K@C will provide a clue as to the position of the ace --but East did not show a two suiter which might work in his favour|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe an early @C from dummy means the singleton K wins so no @C loser, just a @H and 2@Ds let it make?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: John gave me some mouth and is right. 3@H the best for NS by there poss.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now I understand the rule: "The 5-level belongs to the opponents". When East bids 5 @H, North is opponent, so...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  How can East possibly bid 4 NT?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mamos:  best plan is to try to grab some tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|don_kapu: North is a world best player|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with 3 small @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec tells me. One A(@CK) and void.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: original bidding |pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|sharkey: was @SQ a wise move?|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 1 was flat in 3nt -2|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@S was more ortodoxe|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
nt|mamos:  lts hope for better|pg||
nt|jcwla: A score was entered for Bd 1: 2@S/N -2 -- CR playing it now and seemingly en route to matching it.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Good job|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS COULD BE FEISTY BUT THE SPADES WILL WIN|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good save against a making 5@H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another slam|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     n/s can make 9 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos:  part score battle|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@S tempting here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|josj: if E opens 1@C we will know|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may pick the wrong suit as trumps|pg||
nt|ady: north has an awkward decision    1NT overcall could be expensive|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
nt|josj: about previous board, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK; so 2@C was Precision but it was also poor judgement|pg||
nt|jcwla: Such a distortion, that 2@C.  That hand needs so little in the way of a mesh with pd to become, as Edna Ferber would say, so big.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available and lower the contract the better it is, |pg||
nt|haans: yep better played by S|pg||
nt|ady: sspade lead should certainly out paid to this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s are in kami-kaze mood|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not good either|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: it certainly was an unhappy choice|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks twice  east can then swith to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rnmalik: all hands played so far have been misfits including the one which is being played.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double - without even one trick in your hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I was going to say that 5@D was too expensive a save, but this will be even more expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @D loser goes on @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely E did not Pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
nt|ady: up with ace    can now make|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|jcwla: 2@S went down only 1 in the CR so the first blood is 2 IMPs to MGTH.|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the proper contract was reached easily enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@S is an amazing bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: is kamikaze same with harakiri ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-lead - needs a good guess|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
nt|ady: guess the club and home|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|hawe45:  No - 5 @D X is OK for + 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: 5@S = kamikaze bidding and Dbl = harakiri bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - hari kiri you kill yourself - kami-kaze involves killing other people  namely partner!!:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: was better for west to have overtaken the first spade and played 2nd spade   defence needed to get 2 spades first and have east on lead for the heart switch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||

nt|buffytvs: now things are pretty straightforward|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: yes he could claim if he wants to|pg||
nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: east could have continues with 10@S  and then switched to a heart|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||

nt|sharkey: penalty....:(|pg||

nt|h_karluk: guys, did i read wrong?  24  after @h K lead now way to set, but DD defense @d lead then underlead @h A could be different when was in with @sA, so 2@s. 1@d, @h could result off ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one|pg||
nt|haans: overtook to remove the @C entry|pg||
nt|jcwla: And this time a flouting of the rule, avoid leads to NT from A-fourth (other than AK or better fourth).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit *no way to set|pg||

nt|roswolf: e/w got lucky !? but well done anyway|pg||
nt|ady: could be useful swing to Rytal|pg||
nt|rodal f: 12?|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
nt|josj: this should be an equally easy 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: another possible tight game for n/s in 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easy make but agressive to bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW should bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This time  West had a CLEAR-CUT 1 @S bid - but passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pass by E.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.inabridge.com  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Being vul W did not open the hand, |pg||
nt|josj: but not too many overtricks available this time|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: seen it|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did N feel to good for 2@D? Often right|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
nt|roswolf: well they might|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - 1 @D!!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: 4@H for EW has play |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--better to pass and then bid to show a real opner |pg||
nt|ady: likely J@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: defence will need to switch to a spade when in with a diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Fortunate lie of @Ds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't thread the needle with this hand -- "or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||
nt|josj: 3 inescapable losers|pg||
nt|josj: as is so often the case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the spade bid and raise show the fitting hands|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@S better for n/s|pg||
nt|garnetts: After a redouble it is normal that immediate bids by opener show minimal values |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
nt|josj: yes, E hand is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially as the @H lead takes out the only other dummy entry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
nt|josj: even more so as long as you don't know about the 5-5 opposite|pg||
nt|jcwla: As I predicted, the comparison on 2 was between 4@S-3 and 4@S-3 doubled.  So 8 more to MGTH to break on top by double figures.|pg||
nt|ady: might  make unless west rises with ace and switches to a spade|pg||
nt|rodal f: But a new press by the @C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||
nt|josj: but a chance for Kepri to pull back on  3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The lead of @S also helps declarer.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos:  as it happens if NS play Diamonds West will lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jcwla: Well, Lord Yarborough would have to pay off 1000-1 to E here.|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3@S is silly |pg||
nt|don_kapu: a light weak opening|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S would be my choice as S on first round|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S applies the pressure |pg||
nt|haans: they only need @SK right to make slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only 17HP  at NS but ....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo N overvalued his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes david 4@S was indicated|pg||
nt|ady: slam very likely to be reached|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open started with 26 so we may get comparisons soon|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: I did type that before I saw he had :)|pg||
nt|lml: its a hard decision and imps is all about games|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he might have a shot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: he has a great hand -- partner is a little light, but I sypathize with his double|pg||
nt|josj: but all four  nines as a compensation|pg||
nt|josj: 12 tricks will be claimed soon now|pg||
nt|ady: and a reasonable slam it is|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult decision / spade finesse or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: just arent enough tricks I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's going to lose at least one in each suit I think|pg||
nt|lml: maybe another in the wash|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after the club switch|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: could easily lose two spades|pg||
nt|mamos:  surely South will try 3@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But he didÂ´nt bid 2 @S over the double - strange|pg||
nt|mamos:  i agree|pg||
nt|ady: switch the major suit kings and 13 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: also he was left to ponder bidding 4@S anyway and he clearly should have done so|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: that is one wash|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|lml: I dont think he can avoid down 2|pg||
nt|lml: there is a promotion|pg||
nt|lml: even on a good spade guess|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, West scores another trump on a club ruff|pg||
nt|lml: so he can be happy that 3 wasnt making anyway|pg||
nt|lml: and I said promotion like I am supposed to and not uppercut|pg||
nt|buffytvs: how would 3@H have fared -- I didn't have time to look|pg||
nt|lml: like I usually do|pg||
nt|lml: okay if he plays ace and one it is an overruff|pg||
nt|don_kapu: no problemo contract|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|d4|nt|rodal f: B1 was 2@S=for 5IMP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: I think he goes down 2 even without the promotion.. |pg||
nt|lml: overruff|pg||
nt|lml: whatever|pg||

nt|buffytvs: this one looks like fun|pg||
nt|mamos:  another hand with even points|pg||
nt|ady: a pass out in days gone by|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Had W pitched a @D on @C it would have been -3.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@H from North|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S and then 4@S as a dog walking tactic is fine |pg||
nt|haans: no game for EW here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is where I would probably get it wrong by assuming from the bidding that W was likely to have nothing in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: hopefuuly faster|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes e/w might get into trouble here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes / I also would|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not very exciting boards at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
nt|ady: north will open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  4@H should make|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have fair values for game   but 4@S looks doomed     3NT has some chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: A better bid from S than the 2@H at last board?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S not hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt ny south may come against him|pg||
nt|ady: poor pre-empt   especially vul|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This hand fitted well into their system|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
nt|ady: any plus for e/w may be a decent result here|pg||
mb|r|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Definitely|pg||
mb|1S|nt|don_kapu: will e/w go to 4@S ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be forced into bidding 4@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: has west denied 4 spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going|pg||
nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too much|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult decision for N, pass looks appropriate.|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin can make Mike|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||
nt|lml: well the defenders will like the lead momentarily|pg||
nt|rnmalik: As the cards are placed NS can make 6@D but difficult to bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A endplay needed EW by no @C lead and @S returne.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1NT or 2@D?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos:  no   the Heart break  looks too much to cope with|pg||
nt|garnetts: very fortunate lie of the cards |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: although maybe Gord would have opened that hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the RD, this D must be for the money|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcwla: A couple of early coffee break boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: had it down on top on a heart lead    but still dont think it will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The friendly lie of the @Cs lets the contract make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now a 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|don_kapu: amora|pg||
nt|roswolf: but still off |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Did we like that 2@C bid?|pg||
nt|ady: must eventially make 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ady: e/w play udca signals|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos:  i agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something is wrong with one side's carding there.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|josj: something will be wrong too if declarer ducks...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: @C finesse vital and it is correct.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: If E was signalling for a switch with a high @H -- as undoubtedly should be -- S should be following low.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 4@H HERE|pg||

nt|shevek: 6@h by south|pg||
nt|shevek: now|pg||

nt|lestergold: south can work out that no hearts likely to stand up in defence|pg||
nt|shevek: my pd bids 4@h when I could have void....|pg||
nt|haans: cannot ruff @D first wrong declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h would be unlucky choice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 4@H not a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with not passed hand by the p i think 3@d a little gambling|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: do n/s play drury?|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not but a likely contract|pg||
nt|haans: few drury after overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope junior sees a 7 card suit and bids|pg||
nt|haans: right second site as per book|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|shevek: maybe 5@h was a good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: well feeble 5@h bid succeeded in doing enuf dirty work |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i would make a try as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard tho to find this excellent slam with so much bidding spade taken up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 2@h on S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Again Vulerability comes into play - NS may not chase this game being Non Vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a safe partscore|pg||
nt|haans: look no responive double by Clemmensen|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: u mean 2@c then 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: part score again    10 tricks in clubs for e/w|pg||
mb|3N|nt|flash: bear with us, folks - it'll take us a bit to settle in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Judy Wolff would call it a 'napkin hand' -- same idea|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|josj: ah, this should help EW to detect the duplication|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: on board 1 Gartaganis won a couple of imps and board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Amazing reverse from S. Why not X? I have also @H and @D.|pg||
nt|josj: 5@S is still OK...|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead anywere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makeable but 3NT was a superior contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: i think we missed an initial pass|pg||
nt|flash: i think you'll have to redo the whole auction to get South on lead...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C a sound contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and as the cards are placed EW are making 6@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: E was for a neg X and pass from W|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Nice that Doc help opps.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|flash: there are 36 boards shown on the scorecard, so we'll guess that we'll have 18 per quarter|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Can u sniff the @S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S is lucky that N has no entry, but 9 tricks still not clearcut |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: only lose Ace@H.|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @S is played from E and S duck. The story at that color is told.|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS had a nice one at same level|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebids of previously shortness-bid suits show voids -- not stiff aces.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Thought they might get in trouble after 5@D but wd.|pg||
nt|josj: so did I...|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  But against 620, it is good business|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lml: 5@D made ... if you recall that board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and so the 3 NT|pg||

nt|josj: 4@S would have been much easier to handle, though...|pg||
nt|josj: but this is as good a shot as any|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes, so questionable bidding - to put it politely - is rewarded|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|lml: here they defended 4@H doubled|pg||

nt|buffytvs: a horrible misfit NS and nothing much breaks for them|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough to get a plus I would think|pg||
nt|flash: i believe the De La Salle is from Alberta   (more info welcome)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Feeling for a 1NT here Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might after 1@D. But I recomend normaly to stay out there.|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would have guaranteed some slam|pg||
nt|rodal f: The neg X at 2@S?:)|pg||
mb|1N!|an|week|mb|d!|nt|lml: its the not breaks part that is a problem|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wouldn't put any IMPs on Kepri's side of the ledger just yet; as you said, Jos, that bd fraught w/peril.|pg||
nt|josj: but if S ruffs @HK high and plays a trump, he avoids the endplay|pg||
nt|josj: will we see, shortly, Jordan :)|pg||
nt|josj: unlucky to go down in 5 already...|pg||
nt|rodal f: No signal at BBO by the lead but precume a @D lead from S.|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: do you bid 1@S with the East cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: but 3nt needs a careful play after a @h lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice bid at OR. Playable.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is a better 11 count than some wew have seen opened |pg||
nt|mcarroll: we|pg||
nt|garnetts: last hand maybe South should bid 6@C and then 6@H over 6@D  |pg||
nt|ady: card fairly friendly for n/s   can make 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just asking :)|pg||
nt|guppy: criminal to do so...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a auto play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C NS need so @D u just forget.|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s playing strong club?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos:  not an easy hand Frank|pg||
nt|josj: X by N shows four spades...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hmm 800 not really the reward I was anticipating|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! a direct finess in @c to keep entries on dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: There best % I forgot to tell, but all see that.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|garnetts: That would have grabbed North's attention |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H make the same as long as E have the contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||
nt|lml: so probably getting to 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: very|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then it will be 4@H I agree|pg||
nt|lml: it would anyway|pg||
nt|flash: my informant has a slight rooting interest in the match - she's married to West...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@D and @C nicely placed for NS.|pg||
nt|josj: but pass by W does not look a winning action anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: We dont have the bidding from the Open, but I would be surprised if they get to 6 here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: e/w  getting a good result here not opening 2NT  which is down 1 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D, @D ruff and @C and @C ruff=-1|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The weak notrump caused too many problems for EW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: a big win for Korbel|pg||
nt|lml: on a previous board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@D better than 3NT?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: on Board 4 nick and judy dit not get to the game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone for a 3@C opening?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: butt needed E to cooperate|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|josj: declarer trying to go down|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: double would have netted 800    if passed out|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|josj: nope, that would be a sure way of going down|pg||
nt|josj: too many hcp and too few @C|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it the 1@C opening that killed the best contract?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: that was the 4@H hand with 5-5 in the reds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 3NT making 5.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ah|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 4@C is a good contract, but Yeni try to make it game|pg||
nt|don_kapu: discard 1@D from @S ? Is it have a time |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos:  not difficult to defend|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: lucky make or bad defense.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: as one could expect|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mamos:  presumably Strong Club|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|sA|nt|don_kapu: @H ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason not to ruff I wouldnt think|pg||
mc|11|nt|lml: and sooner or later this will drift one down|pg||

nt|h_karluk: when i first started to VG <maybe 4 years ago>i got a good lesson from Roland, unless you are sure off two never double|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP to Bridgeministeriet in the 3NT on 25.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen left for toilet|pg||
nt|haans: ok for 3 in  suit but mb not 3nt directing lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s on EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, that's better advice for doubling into game at IMPs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Which I'm guessing is how it was intended.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this again will be competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hansen had no count of clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: would it be a good slam now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|haans: NS may not find their suit|pg||
nt|haans: east poins are aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: is that really a vul 1@H overcall!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbiddable i suppose|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Cud be a 11 IMPs back to Næsten Junior|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it is how high e/w will compete to if at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: two way c hook and a missing hearts Q which offside|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and normally you shouldn´t go wrong in 6@s, @hA and @hK and if @hQ still is out, finess in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with an auto @d loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west will double?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after this auction 2@s by East was possible|pg||
nt|shevek: well played by south, he knows J is not from Jxx|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may PASS Geoff:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: What's 2@H?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2@H was reverse (strong)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: declarer looks in control here|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S did show 17+|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: 14 points incl stiff @CQ?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: finesse for @c Q but to which direction sir|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: SOUTH HAD BETTER SIGN OFF QUICKLY|pg||
nt|sharkey: After last hand they may be on a mission....|pg||
nt|haans: tomorrow 12.00 and 15.15 Paris time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: the stratosphere is in danger|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: for the final|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: many play 4@C forcing que by p|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hope they know what they're doing...|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S but no interest|pg||
nt|roswolf: north appears still to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: interested i mean|pg||
nt|haans: still why 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it was alerted maybe peter can tell us?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: at last -|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|haans: may doubel finesse in spades|pg||

nt|mamos:  NS less speedy on this hand surely should compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: If Strong club, u might beter have some tools. Reelays?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: then I know I can afford to give up a heart|pg||
nt|lml: after a spade lead|pg||
nt|haans: no bid from Liogu is good|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lml: especially if South is on lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: e/w did well in the OR to restrick to down 1 in 3@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: No X from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: hmmmmm  10-12 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have a good hand for 4@S.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 1nt on S - your opinion Frank?|pg||
nt|rodal f: It smell a 2@S from E now.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   poor overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: mayhbe 11-13 |pg||
nt|ady: if not playing leb  eat might bid 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: as usual, we've started part way through the set of boards to provide comparisons to the Open Room|pg||
nt|mamos:  purist who thinks 1@S x = four card Hearts|pg||
nt|rodal f: A obviouse X from my way to bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At N.|pg||
nt|ady: I prefer double to bidding the diamond suit at the 2 level|pg||
nt|ady: truiph for the weak 2 here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And yet another making 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: For shure nor Ralf.     100% 1@H|pg||

nt|ady: e/w in an awful spot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|don_kapu: strang bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: strange|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||
nt|flash: it'll be a while before they catch up to our starting point and we see changes on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|flash: and we won't have comparisons up until we roll over to Board 1|pg||
nt|josj: 12 tricks for the taking, if you want|pg||
nt|josj: @C 3-3 and K onside, trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|josj: what do you want more?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, Kepri has indeed stopped in 4@S so they will gain double digits on 8.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Got the contract played the right way up this time |pg||
nt|haans: Final word: Timur: I'd say nice dummy ;P|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: I love the @S2|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to have talked through Board 9 - which looks as though there might be an opportunity for the Flock team|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks reasonable|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Declarer can play K@S and J@S to pin 10@S. Lets see.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos:  but diamonds not friendly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|don_kapu: 4@S at least - 2 and now NS cut their neck|pg||
nt|ady: moth best start by Yen   |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
nt|mamos:  diisappointment coming|pg||
nt|josj: just slightly more disciplined by them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||
nt|lml: and Taylor and Balcombe would never lie about the count|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Stevie Aarons|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: U can't X and later bid 2@D. That's 16+|pg||
nt|josj: I would think that on the auction, @DA is likely to be with W|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: more and more popular|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @H - a bid like that should barr your for three months|pg||

mb|3D|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3rd seat very light opening by S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||

nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: as we expected - 3nt went down in OR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@S must be forcing|pg||

nt|haans: yes kick as they fall|pg||
nt|ady: east might lead a club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|thurston:  always nive when part has the 9 so deceptive potential|pg||
nt|josj: I guess it confirmed the five-card @H|pg||
nt|josj: over the 3@C relay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 7@S or NT |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and following it with a bid of 5@H would deserve a longer disbarment!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: one @C loser can be pitched on @D ace.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s the price you pay by bidding SUCH suits|pg||
pc|d3|nt|alchilds: close|pg||
nt|lml: well norths spades arent so hot so he can definitely have the @HK now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S can be made     there is an option of plays|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it    this should make now|pg||
nt|ady: that was about the only lead to give it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: weak distributional hand with support for all four suits?  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting illustration of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 3-3 fit which contravenes burn's law|pg||

nt|haans: 4@C asking for que|pg||

nt|flash: so, unless E-W use Polish-style leads, perhaps West could have worked out not to cash the @SA|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes sorry Frank think you are wrong this time|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich one?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a few imps back|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still 2 segments more so...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 9, where S failed by one in 2@C here, W in the CR made 2@H -- so 2 more to Kepri.|pg||
nt|jcwla: S's opening in there was not 1@C or 3@C but an esoteric 1NT.|pg||
nt|josj: remarkable as it should have been the other way round|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bit unbelivable tha N didn't bid 4@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: can take both   |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2 small miss from NS here and u have the result as it is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@S|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|mamos:  Diamond first and if fails Club|pg||
nt|ady: once no heart lead|pg||

mb|d|nt|flash: folks, we're a VERY small group this segment, so please move down toward the front of the auditorium and feel free to ask questions   :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems a swingy hand |pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Any for a X from S? If...|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: @D first I agree.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I might have put up the @SA rather than covered|pg||

nt|thurston:  hi steve|pg||

nt|snoraa: attack, but with what?  c best, but very hard|pg||
nt|thurston:  and that's without peeking!|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks good result for EW here|pg||
nt|jcwla: That would have been 5 instead of 2.  4@H a reasonable shot here but...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit to being cautious enough to pass 1@S as South |pg||
nt|haans: yes should but will not|pg||
pc|sA|nt|flash: i must admit, i've played opposite Michael, so i had a bit of an edge here   :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for 1NT from N?|pg||
nt|mamos:  lots of 10s, 9s, 8s|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont understand the bidding - not for the first time - 3nt was out of left field|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Any reason not leading a @C?|pg||
nt|josj: yep but not if 2@H goes down and 2@C makes...|pg||

nt|haans: 3@C forced|pg||

nt|don_kapu: @H lead will make + 1|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Martin and Rødal|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open obviously played pretty fast|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: fascinating|pg||
nt|haans: in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: this should be a pickup for Korbel -- I don't think he'll have any trouble making 2@C|pg||

nt|josj: Rylal may well restore the margin here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lml: Gartagnis has some soft results coming in the last 3 boards, especially the last one|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are @S better than @C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|rodal f: Any fun to come? Hope not.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: last b for last action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south knows no fear|pg||
nt|ady: in OR  west started with 2 rounds of spades    contract could have then been make  but declarer played J@C  trying to pin the 10  so last 4 tricks    if  playing for KX could have ...|pg||
nt|ady: made   the contract  of the heart losers go|pg||
nt|haans: SORRY Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|rodal f: Jones:) U have made a nice work as the vug here. TKS:)|pg||
nt|josj: @S and a minor, 2nt asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Next matches should start in 20 mins. from now|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo east should pass|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: 4@H is fun, for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: actually just the last one really|pg||
mb|4D|nt|buffytvs: they might even pickup an IMP here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@H is no fun and a wrong bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do not act in front of partner|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit fun for the specs I belive.|pg||
nt|ady: north got home in 3NT in OR    looks impossible on a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  west checks backs of cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or are N making a help for something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hans and Martin. Was lovley to comment wit u. See u later:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: but the adrenaline kicks in|pg||
nt|ady: one of hr heart losers gets discarded on the good clubs|pg||
nt|haans: This match IMPs by luck |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Bridge is not fair when you gain IMPs for making the wrong decision|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jos I'll be back with you for F6 in about 22 hours from now.  For now, from Los Angeles, I'll say so long.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Radically different bidding in the open |pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: And here we go.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: I never see Silalahi bidding like this|pg||
nt|josj: Good. Ty and good night, Jordan!|pg||
nt|josj: an easy one to conclude the match...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 7 tricks should be fine|pg||
nt|josj: 18 imps difference will convert into 19-11 V.P. I assume|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts with heart finesse on would make but for the doubleton club in north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So seems as some should been killed at level 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos:  lock up children|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this way up has a good chance|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can some def fun rice up?|pg||
nt|mamos:  West failed to find Club switch when winning Heart Ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: playing on diamonds is fine|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I much prefer this bidding sequence to that in the Open|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: But might W felt it as a safe sac.|pg||
nt|ady: lowest spade on 3rd round should have cleared the position in OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: For make E fail @C2 was the right card. No would have done.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board now, thanks to Jones, David, Mike and Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At least 2 down = 7 IMP|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Still one more trap|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have hided yours Mike?:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: definitely; we were complaining about it|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are anyway Rolaland.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: cashing the hearts would have left an interesting ending|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's exactly what I was saying to Linda here|pg||
nt|lml: that would have been much harder for declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he has some toughn pitches to make|pg||
nt|lml: but now the end is nigh... as the crooner used to sing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith holding us up|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he's making now whatever Keith does on this trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is counting on those penalty minutes to score :)|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: probably +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland*|pg||
pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: declarer likes that shift|pg||
nt|lml: that is an imp|pg||
nt|don_kapu: lucky it's not doubled...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the way this match is going, 1 IMP could be critical tomorrow night|pg||
nt|lml: I take that back|pg||
nt|lml: he will just make it|pg||
nt|ady: great defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Paul the Gurita|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: but 19 imps will make it 20-10...|pg||
nt|josj: which is likely to happen here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: best is to discard the club, DD|pg||
nt|josj: but we also can congratulate Rylal from Singapore on winning the tournament|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Susy, how much time do they have left?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpm: bye for now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos:  declarer has two ore tricks 800|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: yes there has been some swings where luck played its part|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: so a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 18min|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes quite a result on what seems to be an innocuous partscore hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|buffytvs: so they just have to start Bd 16 in that time -- should be fine|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpm: closing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
mc|11|nt|josj: well done by all these youngsters|pg||
nt|josj: 20-10 puts them just out of reach|pg||
