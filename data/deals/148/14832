mb|2N|mb|p|nt|joest: don't know the range but even if 20-21 this is a perfectly good upgrade b/c of the strong five card suit|pg||
nt|joest: this is always pretty much a guess what to do with north's cards|pg||
nt|joest: although bidding 3NT is taking a very deep position on the club suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: not vulnerable maybe you can get away with it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|joest: schafer hopes to hit paydirt with a 4-4 heart fit|pg||

mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 3@H seems routine here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Davis in thought|pg||
nt|peachy: E might bid 3NT, 3H just pinpoints the club problem|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps best to be careful, not vul|pg||
nt|peachy: so missed gme is not the end of the world|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: contract is 4H doubled by south|pg||
