nt|warrens:  At the other table, Larsen decided that his hand was only worth 2@D over the X, but it didn't matter as Meltzer then bid 2NT and he raised to game.|pg||

nt|warrens:  I think he was deciding if S had 2 or 3 @h's|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Chip is 100% as usual. Looking at this low imp score match, 6-7 imps is a big swing|pg||

nt|brolucius: able to believe that you have been so stupid. If Geir had been trying this, with @H10-x, Rose would have given him quite a fright.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in other vugraph matches    Cayen 16  vs DeKnijff  14      [Wagar] Westheimer 36 vs Dinkin 13|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is a bit good for 1NT on that hand, because the @SK-Q lie over the overcaller. So he bids 2NT instead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is not 'a bit good' for anything.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Wow. 3@H?!|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|brolucius: That would be bold, even at matchpoints.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are probably inferences about suit length by failure to make immediate Michaels 2@C call|pg||
nt|brolucius: That does not make her hand any stronger, though.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depends upon whether or not they play michaels as (a) weak or strong   or   (b) any strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is true that she knows the aggressive N/S players cannot have more than around 23 or they would have tried for a vulnerable game. So, she can place her partner with around 9 ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: points.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: presumably her aggressive teammates will start the auction 1@D[precision]-1@S|pg||

nt|brolucius: Would it have worked out better for North to play low, allowing South to ruff, draw the last trump anc cross to @DK for two spades to be cashed?|pg||
