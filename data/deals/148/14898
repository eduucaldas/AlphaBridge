nt|andyv:  and we're off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No room for  -en  in Andersbakken. Max is 10 characters|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs should win this battle with this vul|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hihi, nice to see you:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Format is matchpoints, so every trick is important|pg||
nt|andyv:  here 6@h should be the norm unless they can figure out that they (EW) have a 12 card fit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if i interpret the standings right- this is leading pair playing 2. pair- right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: maybe E will have to enter over 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's Swiss|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|haans: 5@S correct 6@D to @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  6N can pay huge dividends in mp play|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Should he have?|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 5 trumps an ace and a king?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He didn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbook example|pg||
nt|woozle: Even so, after taking over with an ace ask, Svare is honour-bound to bid slam unless two aces are missing|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs suggest that S shows the @h queen - he does have 6 hearts and knows prd has 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you know partner has 4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You tell what you have been asked to tell|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem with that hand when ps show 4 card @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess it depends on whether 2NT guarantees four-card support or not.|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps there is a need for adding more refinements to these jacoby style sequences|pg||
nt|jbgood: S has an excellent hand when prd has support|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: point count not giving the hand any justification at all|pg||
nt|haans: AK-six is more than 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony is that without K@d the slam was still good|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if it does, then with AK to six you know you have a ten-card fit, so should show the Q even if you haven't got it|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: Are we sure that North has promised 4, Jon? Don't some Jacoby with 3?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the power of that sixth heart not to mention the 4 card support|pg||
nt|haans: AK-six may be good with Jxx in dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: bidding 2NT with 3 card support would be a strange convention|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: 30sec left|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec suggest that south should have shown short spade with 3@s bid but is that what north wants to hear?|pg||
nt|jbgood: to my knowledge Stenberg (as we call it) is not used by many when only 3 card support, I know about a very few only|pg||
nt|woozle: Since he didn't bid it, are we sure that's what it would have shown?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, because it means that he has some shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either 6331 or a side suit|pg||
nt|haans: in Sweden we open 4-c M|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @h showed a minimum hand I think (common if they play invitational Jacoby, popular in Norway)|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: E disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: W rather|pg||
nt|jbgood: but imho the S hand was far from a minimum:)|pg||
nt|pelu: then for sure he sh have bid 5@s to 4NT|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H can not have been a min bid|pg||
nt|woozle: Biggest risk of 5S bid was a partner who has only one ace and didn't plan for a 5S bid because he knew you didn't have the queen|pg||
nt|haans: yes a risk we all must live with|pg||
nt|woozle: a risk solved by Kickback|pg||
