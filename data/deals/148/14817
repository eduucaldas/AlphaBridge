nt|lestergold: Morning hAANS AND HI SPECS|pg||

nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Goeffrey|pg||
nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: not just this hand but safer any time|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|dT|pc|c7|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pace so far.|pg||
nt|josj: yes, that would be the normal way to do it in Indonesia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Pass - Pass - Pass - and silalahi will bid ??|pg||
nt|josj: yesterday and this morning all teams played a Swiss for 7 rounds; the top 8 qualify for a round robin that finishes tomorrow afternoon|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS turn for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A slightly heavy 4@S does the trick here of keeping @H's out of the picture.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: And 100 is cheap against 620|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 150 sorry|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
nt|josj: good morning Rolanbd :)|pg||
nt|josj: Roland|pg||
nt|josj: sry|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  unlikely to make  even guessing well in clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult to bid imo.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont know their system, precision or standard|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Hard cards it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As to play?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos:  certainly to play  expect itt  to be bid|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|don_kapu: normal lead @Sor @H|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|mamos:  misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|josj: who is our operator?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We will never know, why N didÂ´nt bid 3 NT over 1 NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as that moysany ain't gona work. Next.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|mamos:  seems unlikely that declarer can scramble 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose from where we sit  could pick up 3 club tricks  by playing low to the queen and king  and later laying down the ace  dropping west's J(  and later finessing against the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 8X in east hand   so could make 3 club tricks 1 spad   1 heart and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: wests J9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: Requires some play to make 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't think N/S will usu be left to play quietly in 4@H; the comparison may be between 150 and 500.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jones Karwur according to the profile|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos:  we'll see : )|pg||
nt|ady: needs to play club now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|mamos:  I think club players would bid 3NT  not sure that would work either|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
mc|7|nt|ady: needs to utilize dummys diamonds for 2 entries  1 to play the 3rd round of clubs and 1 to play a heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S made the trial bid of 2@S looking for a check and N took it natural.|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4S64HK6DKQJT2CAJ94,SKT532HQ3D943CK76,S9HAT98754D86CQ83,SAQJ87HJ2DA75CT52|sv|n|nt|bridge_one: 4@S good defence here|pg||
nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Nicoleta Giura|pg||

pc|d8|nt|shevek: hello everyone :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: evening in Denmark?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: declarer should test the clubs by ruffing the third round and then play the spades/squeeze |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: in Australia it is|pg||
nt|shevek: evening in sydney|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||

nt|mamos:  wow |pg||
nt|mamos:  ten solid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@D only works if S was prepared to underruff from the table.|pg||
nt|mamos:  @s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ruff by J and K@S and hand makes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now an easy grand slam to *play*, but to bid .....|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to think really big thoughts.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east playing hearts sort of helped declarer   but understandably did not get the club position right|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  ol|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos:  opposite a weak Diamond opener?|pg||
nt|mamos:  6@S opening?|pg||
nt|josj: the EW hands fit the EW team's name very well: May Good Things Happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I hate to write it, but 4 @S was could in board 16, suppose South had played the @D 7...|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol  hoping to get doubled later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were 25th before the last qualifying round and still got through!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.inabridge.com/|pg||
nt|josj: that's 1 good thing already, then :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Martha Stewart says, it's a good thing!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive at a partscore. Hard for EW to see there nice fit at @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: No @C play. Ruff a @S and a @D.|pg||
nt|ady: north decided on a quiet opening of 1 spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even for money, I would bid 1 @S with such a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D must be the lightest overcall this century|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West passed??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this auction, back to bed|pg||
nt|josj: if 2@C is Precision, that pass is a real surprise|pg||
nt|josj: East will certainly bid on...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Cold up here two Hans:(  +5C by the morning.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree with you, AQ8@S in E  and he he could be endplayed but we have seen the cards.:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  i not sure what North is going to achieve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is going on?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT was a little joke|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a save  even vul against not at the 7 level  down 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW getting punished|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it could NEVER be better to play a @S, sorry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S told his story 3 times now?|pg||
nt|jcwla: When you think of the hands that a precision 2@C could be bid on, W cannot possibly think has described this one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But might S will be in after a @H lead. Then 10|pg||
nt|rnmalik: unlucky contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is a joke|pg||
nt|jcwla: How do you really feel, Roland? :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is but if Precision the hand is way too good for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is the cheapet for e/w   480 on the club lead|pg||
nt|ady: cheapest|pg||
nt|mamos:  East believes his partner's bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a bit fun by the bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  ::)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  out of frying pan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would 3NT been better NS? Only -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems to end up with 7 NT RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  3@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  bets on 3@H?|pg||
nt|josj: I bet it was Precision (but not quite...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like playing grand slams in game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow, this does not bode well for MGTH -- a little bit of almost humorous interference and they've stopped a level short of what we could have expected and two levels short of what ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend?:)|pg||
nt|mamos:  lts hope for better|pg||
nt|jcwla: A score was entered for Bd 1: 2@S/N -2 -- CR playing it now and seemingly en route to matching it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't be correct. 1@H opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     n/s can make 9 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos:  part score battle|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|josj: if E opens 1@C we will know|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ady: if e/w compete  they can make 8 tricks in hearts  and go down1 in 3 hearts likely undoubled to lose 100|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all do. Specs as commentators. Not the best we have seen.|pg||
nt|josj: about previous board, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK; so 2@C was Precision but it was also poor judgement|pg||
nt|jcwla: Such a distortion, that 2@C.  That hand needs so little in the way of a mesh with pd to become, as Edna Ferber would say, so big.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available and lower the contract the better it is, |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think e/w will play 3@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos:  NS may go to 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: it certainly was an unhappy choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|mamos:  : )|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@H  if defence slips up and does not cash 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: oh   5@D    well over the top|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D got what it asked for|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: 2@S went down only 1 in the CR so the first blood is 2 IMPs to MGTH.|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the proper contract was reached easily enough|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mamos:  not a gimme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A very sporty 2 @C-bid by south, needs one Ace more|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mamos:  yes  major suit holdings were never going to be good enough|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|mamos:  oppo havent id Spades so partner is likely to hold 3 |pg||

nt|hawe45:  Difficult to bid 6 @D - easy make without the @S-lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
nt|josj: this should be an equally easy 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW should bid game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  This time  West had a CLEAR-CUT 1 @S bid - but passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good pass by E.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT a obv 2/1 bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the @D as now it's better to stay at level 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul by non NS minimiced? Clear 1@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: www.inabridge.com  for standings after round 5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Being vul W did not open the hand, |pg||
nt|josj: but not too many overtricks available this time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feeling good enough for a lift by ure @SXX? Nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  I like 4@D opposite 1NT to show 55 no slam interest|pg||
nt|ady: big swings on hands 2 & 3       n/s made 3NT on hand 2   and played 6@SX on 3  making 13 tricks   |pg||
mb|4H|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can't thread the needle with this hand -- "or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||
nt|josj: 3 inescapable losers|pg||
nt|josj: as is so often the case :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|mamos:  n our earlier stanza we saw examples where overcall not made and suit not lead and imps lost|pg||
nt|josj: yes, E hand is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
nt|josj: even more so as long as you don't know about the 5-5 opposite|pg||
nt|jcwla: As I predicted, the comparison on 2 was between 4@S-3 and 4@S-3 doubled.  So 8 more to MGTH to break on top by double figures.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos:  Weak 2@D made life easy for North on 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: on hand 3  south opened a weak 2@D   so easier for north to bid 6@S|pg||
nt|josj: but a chance for Kepri to pull back on  3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos:  as it happens if NS play Diamonds West will lead|pg||

pc|d3|nt|rodal f: For NS and @C 2-2? Bookmark this site: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Keith is too good a player to be caught that way though|pg||
nt|lml: well he is doing the strip hearts part|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Sorry have to leave-enjoy:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: that always shows the Q|pg||
nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes i think he'll figure out the spade position|pg||
nt|lml: nobody would lead the jack in that situation unless they had the queen|pg||
nt|lml: it is an oldie|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: 48% for 2-2 and 52% for 1-3 or 3-1. Did odd change by Ws @C play?|pg||

nt|roswolf: re-opening cost n/s 11 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: minimum|pg||
nt|haans: we all would have bid :)|pg||
nt|haans: but easy slam due to 9542 and @D|pg||
nt|haans: in|pg||
nt|shevek: 7542 just as good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E could have seen this and switched to a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jcwla: But then ten with no problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: doubt they'd go to game here|pg||
nt|shevek: you're looking at all the cards, peter?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|shevek: @d 2-2, @s 4-4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E knows that W has @hJ|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Woudl South's hand qualify for a 2 NT opener?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes I did not thk they bid it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1NT=15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if @D support goes to 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Peter direct or after 1x please?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: actually i wouldnt have - i have a principle dont re-open unless you can double any contract by the opps AND defeat it only with your hand - ie with no defensive trick from pard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: i agree with this bidding|pg||

nt|lml: I think he just dozed off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this one looks like fun|pg||
nt|mamos:  another hand with even points|pg||
nt|ady: a pass out in days gone by|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Had W pitched a @D on @C it would have been -3.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: hopefuuly faster|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 10 tricks in spades NS, 11 in diamonds EW|pg||
nt|ady: north will open|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos:  4@H should make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: I dont think this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a LAW deal though -- 22 total trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S not hopeless|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: but the LAW is often very imprecise when there are two big fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and double fits|pg||
nt|lml: so how high to go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: usually it predicts too few tricks though, not too many|pg||
nt|lml: that is an awfully good weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that 5@D makes|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lml: even 4-11 it is a good weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha -- a wide range weak 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tactical, 3rd chair|pg||
nt|lml: so Taylor needs to dive|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross isoing to bid again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going|pg||
nt|lml: I will provide the board for him ... dive dive dive|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too much|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult decision for N, pass looks appropriate.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: he may be worried about defending 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: you have no defense fellow and lots of offense|pg||
nt|ady: dont thin can make Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: remember Keith could have a 4-count|pg||
nt|lml: okay I give you that one... but east only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: and west was a passed hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: switch the ace and king of clubs between West and North -- same auction, EW cold for a slam|pg||
nt|lml: well the defenders will like the lead momentarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A endplay needed EW by no @C lead and @S returne.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  no   the Heart break  looks too much to cope with|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: although maybe Gord would have opened that hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: A couple of early coffee break boards.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: had it down on top on a heart lead    but still dont think it will make|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: now a 2nd diamond|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Did we like that 2@C bid?|pg||
nt|ady: must eventially make 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos:  i agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Something is wrong with one side's carding there.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|josj: something will be wrong too if declarer ducks...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here 4@H are èpossible guessing the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: iportant point tho often missed by non experts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow go toilet|pg||
nt|haans: by experts 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not very awake experts|pg||
nt|jcwla: First result in, no swing on 21 at 3NT/E making six.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 4@s dbl less one is the best contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is routine safety|pg||
nt|haans: bored experts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@SX is cheap|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S easier to find than 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: only 3@D "what am i doing here"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: nothing going to keep east quiet here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and what a dummy to buy by east that is if he is allowed to play 5@h|pg||
nt|shevek: good bid 5@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: first result = no slam in either rooms|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd seat also not 15-17|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at nonvul|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H likely|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sharkey: East shudnt invite even|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: i would have raised spades if north's bid showed 5+|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@s only two off|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, but hard to know...|pg||
nt|haans: let opps have the 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: north too weak to bid again vul of course|pg||
nt|shevek: level 5 belongs to opps|pg||
nt|shevek: you type faster Haans :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: the @c pips are good|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east may push his side into minus territory|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D as bad as 4@S -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: north hasnt any extras to bid game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: north can try 4@S hoping to find xxx or Hx in South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west may axe anything bid now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: assume they have screen betweeen West and North?|pg||
nt|haans: Juniors are far from 40 imp pickup|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: View 500 game bonus VUL I think East shud go for game when 4-4 fit found|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes scrren here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I cant see north biddin when screen closed|pg||
nt|haans: thats why it took time before North bid |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for natural sys bidders, east hand interesting, 1n>2n (@d bulk) idea stucks with that bal 9 points|pg||

nt|buffytvs: back to earth with a 20-20 deal|pg||
nt|flash: welcome folks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trump promotion both hands but W did not capitilise. @H return and @C by E, the contract was -1.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 was an overtrick IMP to MGTH in 4@S when Hidayat went to bed with @CA.  13-11 thru 4 comparisons.|pg||
nt|josj: another very good slam except for the trump AK...accidents may well happen here or there|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lml: strenuous conversation in the pub after the game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos:  NS too Speedy on 4 & 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi David - Mike - specs and the nice vug operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: those are the judgment calls that swing a lot of IMPs.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: NS had a cheap save and didn't take it -- plus position EW|pg||

mb|4S|nt|flash: bear with us, folks - it'll take us a bit to settle in|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Judy Wolff would call it a 'napkin hand' -- same idea|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|josj: ah, this should help EW to detect the duplication|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|lml: on board 1 Gartaganis won a couple of imps and board 2 was a push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Amazing reverse from S. Why not X? I have also @H and @D.|pg||
nt|josj: 5@S is still OK...|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: i think we missed an initial pass|pg||
nt|flash: i think you'll have to redo the whole auction to get South on lead...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C a sound contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and as the cards are placed EW are making 6@C.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|flash: there are 36 boards shown on the scorecard, so we'll guess that we'll have 18 per quarter|pg||
nt|josj: there we go...|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: NS had a nice one at same level|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ady: not fond of the 2@H  bid in that austion|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: 5@D made ... if you recall that board|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S would have been much easier to handle, though...|pg||
nt|josj: but this is as good a shot as any|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 a push at 4@H making.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|lml: here they defended 4@H doubled|pg||
nt|lml: and that was 7 imps to Korbel|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the diamonds all good now  so 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|lml: this is a hand where you count tricks as you play them ... trick 6|pg||
nt|lml: and I just need 2 more|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing the last diamond and ruffing with the J will work well now|pg||
nt|lml: he is going to make the @SK sooner or later|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: yes that would work|pg||
nt|lml: this might not|pg||

nt|haans: what do you need for 3m prempt|pg||
nt|haans: they had a little talk|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup west can come back to life|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam time|pg||
nt|haans: but not easy |pg||
nt|shevek: shd be easy enough, triple fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d infrangible but 6@s can be beat as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: by two tricks double dummy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 4@H HERE|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a lot in england|pg||
nt|haans: vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: even vul but in second seat should be more than this imo|pg||
nt|shevek: 7@h good sac|pg||
nt|haans: but will they have a lead direct|pg||
nt|jcwla: One overtrick IMP to Juniors in 2@S on 22.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: will they get there?|pg||
nt|shevek: 6@h by south|pg||
nt|shevek: now|pg||
nt|lestergold: should do|pg||
nt|lestergold: south can work out that no hearts likely to stand up in defence|pg||
nt|shevek: my pd bids 4@h when I could have void....|pg||
nt|haans: cannot ruff @D first wrong declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h would be unlucky choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@H not a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with not passed hand by the p i think 3@d a little gambling|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: do n/s play drury?|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not but a likely contract|pg||
nt|haans: few drury after overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope junior sees a 7 card suit and bids|pg||
nt|haans: right second site as per book|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|shevek: maybe 5@h was a good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: well feeble 5@h bid succeeded in doing enuf dirty work |pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: well i would make a try as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard tho to find this excellent slam with so much bidding spade taken up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 2@h on S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Again Vulerability comes into play - NS may not chase this game being Non Vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a safe partscore|pg||
nt|haans: look no responive double by Clemmensen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: u mean 2@c then 2@h|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is about to suffer a slow death perhaps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: the excellent slam in diamonds of course not spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its like SAYC|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3 to Bridgeministeriet on 23 when the Juniors went to 4NT on the hand that fails in 3NT.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: do you bid 1@S with the East cards?|pg||

nt|josj: X by N shows four spades...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was going to say something starting off queens are... but then I thought ...maybe not the best phrase|pg||
nt|mamos:  Id expect to raise with North|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: confirmed as Edmonton...    West won the Canadian Open Pairs in the '80s and the E-W pair was 2nd in last year's edition of the COPC|pg||

pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: i wonder how forcing this sequence is for them?|pg||

nt|rodal f: If Strong club, u might beter have some tools. Reelays?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: then I know I can afford to give up a heart|pg||
nt|lml: after a spade lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: especially if South is on lead|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|flash: as usual, we've started part way through the set of boards to provide comparisons to the Open Room|pg||

nt|don_kapu: strange|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||
nt|flash: it'll be a while before they catch up to our starting point and we see changes on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|flash: and we won't have comparisons up until we roll over to Board 1|pg||
nt|josj: 12 tricks for the taking, if you want|pg||
nt|josj: @C 3-3 and K onside, trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|josj: what do you want more?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, Kepri has indeed stopped in 4@S so they will gain double digits on 8.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: I love the @S2|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to have talked through Board 9 - which looks as though there might be an opportunity for the Flock team|pg||
pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT looks reasonable|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos:  but diamonds not friendly|pg||
pc|d8|nt|don_kapu: 4@S at least - 2 and now NS cut their neck|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: W hadn't muchto say I presume.|pg||
nt|mamos:  diisappointment coming|pg||
nt|josj: just slightly more disciplined by them|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||
nt|lml: and Taylor and Balcombe would never lie about the count|pg||

nt|rodal f: U can't X and later bid 2@D. That's 16+|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen left for toilet|pg||
nt|haans: ok for 3 in  suit but mb not 3nt directing lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||

mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: two way c hook and a missing hearts Q which offside|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S from E|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 2@S again?|pg||
nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||

nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
nt|josj: but still, I sympathise with 5@C|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||

nt|mamos:  now Diamond finesse is  free|pg||
nt|mamos:  as Heart loser certain to go away|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|mamos:  ooops|pg||
nt|rodal f: Driving for the @C hook|pg||

nt|jcwla: S's opening in there was not 1@C or 3@C but an esoteric 1NT.|pg||

nt|ady: over the top in OR   another chance to get some imps back for Telkom|pg||
nt|rodal f: Strange when the sellular need to be at the hotelroom|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS bid game in Or without quite the values|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|lml: fascinating|pg||

nt|buffytvs: this should be a pickup for Korbel -- I don't think he'll have any trouble making 2@C|pg||
nt|mamos:  prefer to overtake when xxx in dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|lml: I am just awed that they can get there|pg||
