nt|henryb:  gm Martin|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi al, what is EW basic system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   always in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i don't have a CC for EW -- but when i played a few events with Mitch -  25 years ago?  it was 2/1 :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, whatever it is it does not extent to overcalling 1NT with a balanced five count|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dburn: although I realise that this does not narrow the options down very much|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Opposite 14-16 South may pass; over 15-17 South is likely to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  wrong again|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: but this is certainly full-blown Meckwell - reach a game that won't be bid in the other room, then try to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're fine henry -- "may" covered pass & stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: discussing carding|pg||
nt|dburn: but what with @hQ where it is and the defense off to this start, I don't see that he can make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other room, apparently Meyers and Davis play weak NT, or 10-12 and 1N rebid was weak enough that S did not try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch both rooms of this match simultaneously using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart finesse down 2, play on diamonds down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Clerkins - EW for Simson in the other room are playing a Big Club, but i don't have any details beyond that|pg||

mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: we are having connection problems...system is slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the first round of knockouts when Johnson-Simson sat against meckwell .. i wonder if there were any alerts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: not your fault :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@D|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c probably diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: full-blown Meckwell involves full-blown transfers after takeout doubles (including redouble)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: The operator will fix the problem with seats etc.  It requires a short brek, nd the operator will get to it ASAP I am sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|dburn: of course, if Johnson had passed instead, he might have ended up defending 2@d doubled after East bid it, South doubled it and everybody passed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think we have to blame [credit] Jeff Rubens with that.  Weren't transfer advances and after dbl part of Useful Space Principal?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  schafer might have done better to lead trump|pg||

nt|peachy: hi Mrtin|pg||
nt|dburn: this isn't easy to analyze at all - there may be a way to make it, but declarer may follow some other line on the basis that he will think hearts are 4-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ or 10 might work here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is so ugly, can we have a skip|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Simson in thought|pg||
nt|dburn: hardly surprising - it isn't at all clear how he should proceed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: players talking about fast/slow play|pg||
nt|dburn: what, already?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Simson explaining that it's a tough hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|peachy: My letter "a" is a miscreant this morning, sorry if I dont ctch ll of the missing ones|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me declarer must work on his side suit|pg||

nt|dburn: would not be all that surprised to see 2NT anyway|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|dburn: but no - discipline rules|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Doug says the bad majors outweighs the club winners|pg||
nt|dburn: double presumably majors, and now - how much will East do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: PASS=0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N?  then @H bid becomes invitational|pg||
nt|fabsayc: key question, does east have any forcing bids|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might, but I imagine he will want to take up room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that is one version of follow-up to "mathe over 1@C"|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h looks about right|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: dull 4@H contract|pg||
nt|peachy: FYI all, the operator is working on getting the prob fixed, peace!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: oh, OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: as long as score is tied, matters not|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe double wasn't majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like EW dont agree what double means|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: Flat board in front of us, 10 tricks no more no less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bd 18 was only +1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It's corrected in the Movie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if it showed majors or minors, this is OK|pg||
nt|dburn: but it ought not to be too hard to beat 4@h by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now a test for NS defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: doubling 3NT and making it would be an interesting result|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: played by East, it was harder for South to shift to a diamond - that would have allowed 3@h to make if East had @dK and not @sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: seems Johnso should read 3N as running suit, so inferentially @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: but now it won't be easy to beat 4@h at all|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Davis in thought|pg||

nt|peachy: so missed gme is not the end of the world|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: contract is 4H doubled by south|pg||

mb|2D|nt|peachy: Right, seems that way|pg||
nt|joest: saying 5@c is close to making is an overstatement|pg||
nt|joest: it's closer than 3Nt|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: luckily for Onstott west doesn't have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|joest: in the open room they have just started playing the east-west 6@c hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all the slow play comments -- even after taking a break, other room just finished this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not sure the east-west carding|pg||
nt|joest: i.e. whether they play 3rd and 5th vs NT|pg||
nt|joest: or whether the 7 is just an odd lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: standard|pg||
nt|joest: ok an odd lead :)|pg||
nt|joest: from Dunitz perspective it can't be fourth best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th best|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club at the other table, hence bound to reach game - not bound to make it, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lynn Deas told me that Dennis Clerkin did great job reading the hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest: b/c that would give Koshy QJ9x where he would have led the Q|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's quite a compliment from a many time world champ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he got a heart lead and found that he had four heart tricks, but even so his problems weren't over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnson endplayed on opening lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: if south started with Axx for example, Onstott needs to duck this!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  make that Simson|pg||
nt|dburn: and make that "not endplayed" - he could lead a spade to good effect|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Koshy thinking |pg||
nt|joest: in the open room north-south took out insurance and saved over 6@c|pg||
nt|joest: so Onstott will shortly put some imps in its column|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: I gave you what they agreed to|pg||
nt|joest: ok|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: two good but likely failing slams on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice unblock bigtrain  [Walter Johnson's BBO login name]|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: then they dropped another trick in the claim process :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: that's what I have to put in the record|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h is weak and perhaps very misjudged here as it will cause east-west to lose their spade fit and spade game!|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Koshy is strong enough that he might move but his partner could have 'hearts and out'|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|joest: drinks are on me if they find 4@s now|pg||

nt|joest: might even go down here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Koshy is unhappy|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|joest: as well he might be|pg||
nt|joest: although if you are going to bid there is something to be said for bidding 2@s. You wouldn't move without distribution so bidding 2@s shows long diamonds at the same time|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|joest: In the Bridge World's "You Be the Judge" I would probably apportion it about 20%west and 80% east|pg||
nt|joest: others might well disagree with me though|pg||
nt|joest: so a big 15 pickup on board 9: double slam in one room, save in the other|pg||
nt|joest: Onstott will give some back on board 10 with their 800 payout in 4@sX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: system froze|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: director has been called regarding Koshy's claim|pg||
nt|joest: on the 800 hand north-south did not take the 800 they were handed and bid on to 5@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: similar start in other room, but Meyers did NOT pin the @D9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no @H cash means declarer discarded differently than recorded|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no...s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Simson just didn't cash it, then apologized|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: well it was fair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+bal |pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: Good bridge all around, pushes, and no big swings|pg||
nt|po-s: minus 5???|pg||
mb|r!|nt|joest: he should have only been one on this hand and he claimed down two|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that's two hands in a row I guess where east-west dropped a trick in the claim/concession process|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=game force, no better descriptive bid|pg||
nt|dburn: strange sort of auction at the other table - not at all sure what was going on there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: Schafer has a tough decision as a passed hand.  simple 2@s raise or something more|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure what the negative double solves though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he claimed without stating a line of play|pg||
nt|joest: it will now go 3@h and then 4@s i am guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this lead assures 4@S down|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|joest: Dunitz asking what this sequence shows  It probably shows this|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: 4@s will make on this layout|pg||
nt|joest: although maybe not if they start with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|po-s: spade heart DK and two ruffs?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer got a spade lead and began by taking her best (perhaps only) chance for the contract by leading a heart to the ten|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: yeah it takes three rounds of diamonds to beat this|pg||
nt|joest: here is Koshy's chance to shine|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|joest: and now the make or break play|pg||
nt|joest: looking at Q9xx of trumps this play is not that hard|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, |pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: still if the king of clubs is the king of spades you might need a club switch|pg||
nt|joest: still a LOT of work left on this hand for Dunitz|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: so 3 back to Meyers on the 800 hand in this room|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|joest: it loses legitimately to Hx on your right|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2@s rates to end the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(10)11-15 HCP, 6+@C may have side 4 or 5 card suit|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|joest: except where Walt Schafer is playing :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D ask|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h was on the conservative side at the other table - North certainly had no reason to bid on over it|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|joest: i can hardly believe my eyes actually :)|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what Koshy is thinking about|pg||
nt|joest: his hand might have some value in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: partner's will not in 3@h|pg||
nt|joest: well this is a swing which north-south cooked up out of nowhere imho|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|peachy: Opener chooses to show his long clubs insted of 1S.  May not turn out best in this hnd|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but now that South has opened the bidding, there is no chance that game will be missed|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted by simson|nt|fabsayc: 3 sessions of this match today, 4th segment tomorrow|pg||
nt|peachy: They have  nice spde prtscore, even game|pg||
nt|peachy: possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Walter-Doug treat this auction differently from Meckwell, so i'm not positive bids after 2@D :(|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, North might be inclined to try for slam given this start|pg||
nt|dburn: and perhaps that is what he is doing|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: after the takeout double 1@S rebid is less attractive than normal|pg||
nt|peachy: agree, that ws probably his resoning too|pg||

mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|joest: 3NT down two in the other room on board 11.  Which is what it went down here except for the misconcession|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: raija is proving you can write all words with missing letters as long as beginning correct and it will be quite readable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: defenders still have a club and two trump tricks to go here so will collect 300 on a part score hand.  very well done|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I've lost the play...I can't see the cards played|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there is a lot of table talk, and they are playing fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am wondering if taking that discard on the diamond was really best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely the toughest part of being operator -- 1) players don't let you see cards 2) they don't let you in on what claim was actually made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now play has stopped...Simson is thinking, immobile|pg||
nt|po-s: does he think he is in 4 spades?|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|joest: 3@c looks to be "Jacoby 2NT"|pg||
nt|joest: Im guessing but maybe 3@d means "I have a singleton somewhere"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C is ok as past hand, otherwise slight overbid|pg||
nt|joest: many top pairs like the old fashioned natural forcing 2NT response|pg||
nt|joest: and 3@h asks where|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: and when you play that it means that your 2/1 responses are always 5+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: trump led will sink 4H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i am positive that i'm not sure|pg||
nt|po-s: what would he bid with diamonds?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what would he bid with heart invite|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, double of 3@C was rosenkranz, showing top honour|pg||
nt|joest: on the east-west accident where they played 3@d with their 4-4 spade game, east west have arrived in 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|joest: so Meyers will be extending its lead in a couple of minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you lose something either way|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure whether Schafer knows that Dunitz has extras or not|pg||
nt|joest: Some "Jacoby 2NT" systems show that|pg||
nt|joest: In this month's ACBL bulletin is a 'new improved' Jacoby 2NT written up by Larry Cohen which everyone should check out|pg||
nt|joest: anyway this is an icecold grand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|joest: pointed out to me that on spades 4-1 you need to guess the jack of spades and that is definitely true|pg||
nt|joest: I jumped the gun|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: making:)|pg||
nt|joest: it looks like 6@s was a grand slam try of some sort|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what 6NT means|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|joest: so the lead is up to 23 now because of that spade game|pg||
