nt|casenjo:  There were 2 hands yesterday, with more high cards than this, but flat hands. BOTH tables correctly stayed out of slam.|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Good  bridge players are good planners.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North knows that there will be a long suit in dummy and has a lot to think about|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Heart lead gives West 13 tricks, any other lead gets to 12, unless North is squeezed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: looks like 13 here, too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|casenjo:  North will be squeezed. Looking at 8 high cards on this auction, North was very tempted to cash the Ace of diamonds, but felt like that was giving up|pg||

mc|8|nt|casenjo:  If West didn't hold all of those spades, he might have needed an extra trick in the heart suit, knowing the finesse will lose, North would beat the contract.|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|iceking: 2h is 10-13hcp |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is NOT your traditional wk 2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but a better hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: at vul,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: not worth it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: good def needed here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|casenjo:  Strul will have a tough time with this one|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|casenjo:  On a diamond lead and spade back, East will never see the dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: Silla cant return spade |pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|casenjo:  So the question is: Down 1 or 2?|pg||
nt|xenya: or 3?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: @D lead|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Yes, perfect defense and clubs are played out of hand|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Best lead!!!|pg||
nt|phil: but they can only take two clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|casenjo:  ruff this, spade back, ruff again and declarer plays from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|phil: the lead should be suit preference if the partnership is in tune, although the double need not be Lightner-ish|pg||
nt|casenjo:  At the other table, Brogeland led the 10 of diamonds, but Erik now cashed the ace of clubs, letting declarer out for down 1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much for that idea, |pg||
nt|iceking: true it wasnt easy to find the correct def here|pg||
nt|iceking: notice Fantoni and Nunes open at 1 level very heavy so that leaves 10-13hcp for second level as all opening promice 14hcp|pg||
nt|iceking: they play 12-14nt opening and it does not promice bal hand |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|phil: only because they didnt get their club trick, North continued a spade after the 2nd diamond ruff|pg||
nt|casenjo:  allowing declarer to get to dummy|pg||
nt|phil: rt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: if kyle ruffs this and returns a low club (not unreasonable if rose doesn't ask for a spade back) then they can get it 4 on a misguess|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: picking declarer clean |pg||
nt|iceking: hand is over now as we can see Nunes will score 110 |pg||
nt|sybarra: and just makes not matter what |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|casenjo:  after this ruff, if north exits anything but a spade they get more tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|c7|nt|casenjo:  Meltzer makes it easy for partner|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well done, Rose|pg||
nt|phil: I think playing South for the @sA alone is wrong - pard would have led it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  great point|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|d3|nt|poohbear: 2@H in 4th seat is not a normal preempt. Shows a good playing hand . Obv one could always pass it out|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will set up a @s trick for a @d pitch umless the defense finds a @c play now. Also the defense can return a small @d and declarer can misguess but that's not likely ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: looking at the 9 in dummy|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|d|mb|r|nt|phil: however, looking at the South hand, a diamond void is pretty likely holding an Ace|pg||

pc|c7|nt|iceking: this bidding usually askes for trump lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: dicey X at the one level |pg||
nt|iceking: reason Nunes didnt overcall 1nt was his diamond holding as 1d was natural always unbal |pg||
nt|iceking: i am not a big fan of this lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure I would sit |pg||
nt|sybarra: too scared of them making  or even +1|pg||
nt|iceking: east opening promice unbal hand so he had no reason to move Boyes dbl|pg||

pc|cK|nt|warrens:  better to have the lead going into his partner and, if she has 3 spades, it might play just as well in NT anyway|pg||
