nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the ANC Open 2010 Finals - Round 3 of 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it's NSW vs WA|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Modified Kplan Sheinwold|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Mike (vug opp) specs and follow commentators. I'm Frank from Norway 02.00 by the night.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome to Hobart in Tasmania for the Australian Interstate Championship. Final, 6 segments of 10 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hans Werge and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ready in Copenhagen - allthough The little Mermaid is in China...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all - it's morning in England|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing Standard|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, let me know :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkm: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html for running scores|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Pol -Swider playing Polish Club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like EW are playing some kind of strong club system |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Wu-Peake playing Strong Club|pg||
nt|rodal f: Info u will find here: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anc/|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 3nt makes here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: EW can make 3@H but NS saved over 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm another judgment hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: did well to get out for one off too|pg||
nt|sybarra: and real action to start |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, let me know:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Thanks John|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkm: par score says 7@HX-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sac's sac's and more sac's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: what are next Saturday's winning lottery numbers? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Irwin:) Nice to see u.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet hand to start with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mike|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I think a lot of folks would bid 3 @C  rightly or wrongly  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H also doubtful -- S has a lot of losers and reasonable defense, though not enough to be happy if opps go on to 6S as there may be freakish distribution|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi there; sorry, but they started early|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not so sure about 2@d though - but South sure bought a fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The double of 2@D seems pointless to me--I would have bid 3@D and used to double to show a decent hand |pg||

pc|c5|nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, feel free to ask! :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: good morning David|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @D must have showed a @D-suit - but where is it, this is no suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not best to try that at home, overcalling on Q9632 - partner will have a singleton and you will go for 1100   |pg||
nt|rodal f: As normal the service at top. Tks Mike:)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: this looks to be down 1  with that good support|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - that is why you asked the LOTTO number - for South|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: the 6 @H might have added the push they needed |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugrapha4: Welcome Rodal :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: good defence ---ignore the bid of double of 2@D and make the best lead --well done |pg||

nt|nickf: by the way, when it comes to the Finals you wont need to prefix the names with ACT|pg||
nt|nickf: Ok you cant do it post - data entry|pg||
nt|nickf: doesnt matter for now.|pg||
nt|nickf: On Friday it wont say Team 1 - it will say TAS   or NSW etc|pg||
nt|nickf: tell me when you are back - I ahve worked out how to change the Team names|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHA3: im here|pg||
nt|nickf: click on F9 on your keyboard - then you can change any or all of the initial parameters you input|pg||
nt|nickf: but you only need to make the HOME team ACT and the Away team VIC|pg||
nt|nickf: well done :)|pg||
nt|nickf: but Fred warns me against using the F9 key - he thinks it is a bit unstable|pg||
nt|nickf: can change now if you have time (or wan to )|pg||
nt|nickf: bewdiful|pg||
nt|nickf: ....and finally.... again if yo uhave time.... better to change flag to Australia..|pg||
nt|nickf: aaaah :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: OK.|pg||
nt|rodal f: We have a tropic summer up here. Just now +4C:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: disgraceful :)|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|davidstern: Things are pretty bad when you lose 4 trump tricks befor looking at the rest of the hand???|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzkm: but the scores are not up to date, working on it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do S have for the 4@S vul when W ain't limited?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S south could NOT have made 450 on the previous hand?????|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugrapha4: Have to confirm|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: easy 4 of either major probably +1 |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sounds lovely - it's 15C here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: need to keep low here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may come in here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: namaste Avram|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed - but South may bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like six to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the second round in the ANC Open Finals|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: NSW vs WA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi David - specs and Mike.|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK there we have it 4@S down 3|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Welcome to the ANC Youth Finals 2010|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Vic vs NSW|pg||
nt|davidstern: which Mike is entertaining us|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: From bad to wourse?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: though a low diamond would probably beat 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he has time to pitch the @H |pg||
nt|marlowepi: six spades i mean of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an aggressive North might double 2@S, but here, vulnerable against not and with a passed partner - no thanks|pg||
nt|ady: needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|april7: S might reach here a @H contract going down without a @S lead losing 1@H 1@C and 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@c showed a genuine suit, 3@C by East makes life more difficult |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|april7: I meant a 4@H contract, but now S is safe|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Polish Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing a Strong Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, don't hesitate to ask :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: dont think he is under any time pressure|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugrapha4: 2H is 11-15 Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For all beginners, special defence needed for forcing pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Ed:) Enjoy.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: Not in favour of this type of bidding --as mentioned previously I think this should show 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but a low D lead misguessed would hurt his entry situation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: N loves those clubs in dummy, temporarily|pg||
nt|irwinbo: unblock|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: got that right    should just make|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing ACOL|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, feel free to ask! :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|davidstern: This wont be too pretty |pg||
nt|davidstern: looks like 0-1-1-2 losers but there arent a lot of winners|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: W rightly plays the king to get under N's skin....make him think for a while that the suit was guessed correctly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|vugrapha4: Hi all commentators|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may lead it back and he did|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 2 @H first round of bidding,but better this way,fortunately for her|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: right but even a few moments' anxiety can help contribute to an accumulated psychological toll later|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ady: running into 2 club ruffs now|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'm sure he'd love to hear that...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ady: cash 1 more heart|pg||
nt|ady: then 4th club|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi,  Mike!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: HI Ed. Thanks for joining us|pg||

nt|sybarra: has a lot to do here |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|rodal f: The sun riced a lot now. |pg||
nt|rodal f: W a bit unlucky by the @D def?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Potential misclaim by Brayshaw|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E disputes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A I see, stillone looser for 500|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: No idea what's going on here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: They seem to be resuming|pg||
nt|irwinbo: looks like one down for 200|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: NOW Director called|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Hands on table for D's approval|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @C or a @H looser to come?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: sorry two down|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Because Brayshaw didn't say anything about pitching in misclaim,cannot pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating between -1 and -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct by the book but also common sence by the playing are inside that law.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: West still wants -2, East wants -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: vug for me. Sr:(|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: For now, it'll be -2 until a change. I'll keep you posted on the final resolution.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|irwinbo: no double of four spades in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidstern: Likely -2 now|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was "assuming" NOrth may try for a club ruff to limit the damage|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the road for that now.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: still 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: -2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzkm: look at round 11, thats the standing before this round. round 12 is simply wrong|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: now the club cash pitch  a ht |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: odd that West played a second club rather than playing on diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: In USA tournament play, we get exactly no experience against forcing pass systems, which are barred without reservation.  Our loss.|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: nice misfit here|pg||
nt|april7: interesting hand coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, cute misfit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I thnk NS have a 2NT opening to show both minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will amuse East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thats ok, so beginners woun't be killed by a lot of different systems.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ady: started ok    then fell by the wayside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is NOT the board, where you shall led the @D Queen against a @S-contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks a normal lead though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - thatÂ´s the problem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if N and E were partners it would be a cold grand slam in either minor :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might open 2NT for minors, otherwise E will reach a 3NT contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may pass....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the basis that they have not been doubled yet|pg||
nt|april7: S will chose the igher card,@D|pg||

nt|rodal f: If -3 now the road seemed to be -2 always. What happend?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: misclick|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|april7: E 3NT and probably 7-8 tricks|pg||
nt|irwinbo: that is one heavy 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: and it's not something you can deal with at the table, no matter how well disclosed, so you need to spend extensive time developing counters to it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: apologies|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: If south opens  here and west gets involved they can concede a penalty |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the upside of opening 11 counts --but this one is actually better than the last one I grumbled about |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: attitude leads|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strong NT at W. Do they use 15-18 or 16-18?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 15-17|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would u Xed ther ED? As constructive against a force pass system?|pg||
nt|rodal f: At E.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|davidstern: 6@H looks possible till you see the trump break|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|april7: best lead is @C|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Discount of JC?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Did E have for a 4@D at the road?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: should not lose more than1 clu and 2 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-quess!|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Guessed!|pg||

mb|p|nt|irwinbo: i am very active but i hate 4333 hands|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: UPDATE ON BOARD 2:|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The score stands as on BBO. 5Dx-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't know how to defend it.  Intuitively, double on general power feels right, but I don't know if it may make it easier for them to find a safe harbor.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: Q of @H is an entry to 2 @S tricks so 5 @D,1 @C 2@H and 2 @S tricks, E should ofcourse continue @D|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: there is 9 tricks secured |pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|babs59: board 8  the possible double game swing hand (though EW went -1 in 4H) was the swing, with NS making 4S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: defense did play spades   and declarer dropped QX hearts    but that is still only 9 tricks   6 hearts    2 spades and 1 club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just as a matter of personal style, I hate these 1NT openers with a good six-card minor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: :)  sure always like a + score,  even if a small one |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the opening bid tends to be a slam-killer if partner is suitable |pg||
mb|p|nt|desert: the north hand seems far too strong for a 4@S bid i think....|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think am shell shocked not laydown is it--looked a the score ending in 80 next door |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even if North plays the @Cq on the first round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|davidstern: Good pass by Tewes|pg||
nt|davidstern: Excellent play hand but realised partner had other options with ANY values|pg||
nt|rodal f: The max spot EW but .... -1?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: 3@C=likely six clubs. Gosh, they're playing the old Cambridge University club system from the1980's |pg||
pc|c4|nt|shevek: with @s 3-3 and @c finesse on, this should be ok|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: @CQ and 4 + @DK and 5 to change. Still same opening at N but what's then the max EW?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: not quite david|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is 2H natural then?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sunsamvar: this lead gives options for declarer . he might go for @H 3-3 break|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: much better than playing for @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Push to come.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|garnetts: needs a heart disacrd |pg||
nt|davidstern: Heart forces may see more|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-1 minimum but....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: well with rebid if 3 @H it should be |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: duck|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|shevek: @cx now?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Dt |pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: looked like a pseudo - squeeze in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: On previous hand a flat board as E/W play 5@Dx in the OR|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: , then that is what it is, regardless of the next bid. i was asking about 2H because 2N not obvious if 2H is not natural|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: might easily get one from east in 4@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: may think harder in 6@S |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: Pauline not fooled by that duck|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: sorry first part of that somehow got cut off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i was saying was: if 3H is the bid that shows hearts, that does not retroactively make 2H natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H is either natural or artificial 4th suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it is 3H that shows hearts, then 2H was artificial|pg||
pc|d9|nt|shevek: easy now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: in CR   sspades got set up before clubs attacjed   or defence could have taken 3rd round diamond ruff    so 4 hearts made   diamond  ruff in north hand 10th trick|pg||

nt|babs59: and in 1982 again|pg||
nt|babs59: after that I mostly played on the Open Team|pg||
mb|3H|nt|babs59: that's one ratty suit for a 2S bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: what a swine of a hand to start with |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 20  5 @C X made at the other table |pg||

nt|rodal f: NT=force?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which they should make to lose 1 imp|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: indeed needs some luck from the bridge gods to survive here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D no play on a club lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: 4NT natural?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This needs sorting in serious partnerships |pg||
nt|roswolf: the bidding may have helped though a spade lead is likely from east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4nt should be an attempt to play there i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree Geoff--a spade seems obvious|pg||
nt|garnetts: three potential bids 4NT  5@C  5@D  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not 4@H |pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, 3NT - who needs a heart stop?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice layout but will they end there? 3NT|pg||
nt|davidstern: Club guess for 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: So that make 17 V - 11 NSW so fare at this segm|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could lose 2 IMPS if they only make 3@H though|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@D likely only -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tolat endstation David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Henbest has a hard bid here|pg||
nt|rodal f: U was quicker than me at the bed:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would negatiove double|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Hadn't considered that |pg||
nt|roswolf: trying to be objective as possible i think 5@D was better|pg||
nt|roswolf: no and i think too aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, how did the defense miss its way?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, despite East having a heart stop, this can go a lot off |pg||
nt|davidstern: I am just waiting for my Ipad to get flash so I can commentate in bed with that|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: led ace and club,  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West won't be pleased to see the ten from East.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: partners duty to provide the @H stop|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: interesting bid, @D J lead , 4 down|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup overboard|pg||
nt|davidstern: It sounds like 04:10 in Norway now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree. 2NT aint the best bid I've seen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can I convert it to not the worst but close|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: North will be first happy then sad |pg||
nt|roswolf: but while there is hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't maen to be rude, but this bidding is crazy. How can West bid 3NT, which might be the right contract, with two small hearts? |pg||
nt|rodal f: Again I have a feeling that the system took NS. Strange that the Polich don't play the system anymore.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But still. 50+50=3IMP:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 06.11 and got summer +4C:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Right spot and Well done West bidding 3@D to expose the situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: hot*|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Ah my maths is bad Australian Eastern -8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: needcs the heart finesse to make now |pg||

nt|davidstern: yes I get the weather reports frequently for Flekkfjord where a friend lives|pg||
nt|davidstern: A mutual friend I suspect|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better temp. Possible to go skiing:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2NT is 10-11 semi balanced|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: yes the heart finesse is perhaps all that is necessary|pg||
nt|garnetts: might play three rounds but no entry |pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Hard for W to see how good his cards is at defence, BUT where is the 3rd @D at E?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 16 mins remaining|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S backfired - but very tough to find the club lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange example of a pre-empt doing exactly the opposite of what was intended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Dummy is reading a magazine|pg||
nt|roswolf: the israelis seem to have fortune on their side|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there is a case for west doubling --or for east to consider the implications of the 4@S bid--note west passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not today|pg||

nt|davidstern: Sorry in theOR N/S let the opps play 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkm: Israel seems to have taken the lead now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Playable at slam @C and NT but hard to find bought the bid and right play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: How else do you show 5-4?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Surprising that Nabil (N) allowed EW to steal the pot in 3@D holding @SAQJ10xxx @HQJx @Dx @CJx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with this dummy, the ZIA-rule is not for use (If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it)|pg||
nt|ady: if 4@H makes then n/s have a decetnt save in spade or diamonds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: good stop  6 is not bad contract  spades 2-2 ospades 3-1 and the diamond finess works|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: this is a really poor contract as a result of the opening bid and also the rebid |pg||
nt|garnetts: I was just looking --and David Greenwood got there first---the @D finesse will squeeze South |pg||
nt|rodal f: Any idea at the % for 6@S Irwin? Often a good contract.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As @S 2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that it makes 3NT a good contract |pg||

nt|ady: noone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, I know a few|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3 imps to WA|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: That j@S is an error as South can now throw them |pg||

nt|rodal f: @S 3-1 and @HJXX also enough.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 30-11 this set to Victoria|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: same thing maybe but South can use a suit preference signal |pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe the 2@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S had the @s10 in hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: to suggest a club|pg||
nt|april7: its a rebid after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|april7: a bid of 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess we found one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: but I'm not sure whether it was 4@S or pass.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 13+ having 17 there must be a way to show it.|pg||

nt|garnetts: I now begin to think these poor opening etc lead to more fun contracts even though I wish they would speed things up a bit |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am told that NS play normal lavinthal so the 10@S must have asked for a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why 13-13 at one side - and 13-11 at the other in this match?|pg||
nt|davidstern: By west|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: As also here by 15.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|irwinbo: 40 percent for the 2-2 plus half of the 3-1's equal 25 per cent so it is about 65 per cent|pg||

nt|nickf: oh OK, good idea|pg||
nt|nickf: let me try that|pg||
nt|nickf: bad planning to start 5 boards apart!|pg||
nt|babs59: for us anyway|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW pleased to have a plus score|pg||
nt|mamos:  may feel a change is due|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@S is possible contract but @h ruff looms|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nickf: we might see a game on this hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS seem likely to reach 4@S or perhaps even Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: no we have played this board|pg||
nt|nickf: redeal to c1|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nickf: ooh that's bright|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW will be competing to 4@H, for sure|pg||
nt|nickf: 2S may bury the NS spades now|pg||
nt|nickf: need some system here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|nickf: now Kalmin will need to act over 4H|pg||
nt|babs59: though the 2D was not alerted, it was a multi 2 - showing a weak 2 in hearts or spades (maybe a strong 2NT option)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: thus 2S says Pass if 2S, correct if you have hearts|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|nickf: operator|pg||
nt|oliverc: that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|nickf: is this auction right?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oliverc: I must confess, With the West hand I'd have been bidding 4@H rather than 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  home now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|oliverc: Since 2@S normally shows game interest in @H|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd also be bidding 4H with East, at the very least to stop NS coming in easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: but they've got away with it  -  just need to take the right view in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHA3: yep u chave less chance of getting it wrong:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|mamos:  well North South didnt fight back much|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oliverc: potential for a big swing here, since it looks like 4@S will be making the other way|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nickf: could be a double game swing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: not now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nickf: could have* been|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|babs59: seems reasonable as a line, based on the lack of bidding by NS though|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd be playing for 1-1 on that basis|pg||
nt|mamos:  the vulnerability prvented North from bidding @Ds but might have defeted contract|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|nt|nickf: sure, how on earth could there be 5 spades and heart void in South?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|nt|oliverc: quite easily :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oliverc: Since the points herely level, would South be coming in at the 3-level with a wasted|pg||
