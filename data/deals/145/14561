mb|2C|nt|pbundy: what?  is bob hamman sitting east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: i must admit; not sure that he would open 1@H on this hand - unless they happen to be playing canape.|pg||
nt|pbundy: canape bidding - open shorter suits before longer ones.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|reisig: the non-support pass|pg||
nt|marinesa: 2h here should show a lr in hearts as brad would just raise to 2h with simple heart raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marinesa: apparently not|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, this seems to be a canape pair.  great to see young people testing out different systems|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzfb: Afraid I can't read the notes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "I"m sure DBL is the right bid, but I"m too tired to make it"|pg||
nt|reisig: Jan ...why don't you watch Chip?|pg||
nt|pbundy: north has a lot of cards to pass here.  oops - did not|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I thought thie EW pair were standard Precision, but I see they've souped it up a little since the last time I saw them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Sorry!!|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pbundy: pretty low level to be upping the ante.....  unless this is not penalty but "cards"|pg||
nt|pbundy: particularly with 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Raina asking a question - |pg||
nt|pbundy: i think raina must pass....  see no other choices.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think "5+ @cs?" and Marriott shook his head|pg||
nt|pbundy: i do wonder, however, why south rebid the spades with 4 diamonds to an honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I agree, don't see how she can do anything but Pass, but ...|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pbundy: of course, these players have a few less years of experience than the others competing today :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - that being said - we see the best of the best sometimes take very strange actions!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: Rather light 2@C opening by Chow.  It does say they play aggressive openings on their system summary form, but still a big stretch to 2@C|pg||
nt|debrose: The bidding, except 2@D waiting perhaps, all appears natural.  Too bad Jan can't read the notes.  They probably write like my 13 year old son|pg||
nt|debrose: So lots of high cards and long suits here, but no fit.  Looks like 3N from South would be the safest contract|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Hi Folks :)|pg||
nt|debrose: 4@H would usually make with hearts 4-3, losing only 2 hearts and likely only one diamond.  But as things are here may go down|pg||
nt|debrose: Can make double dummy by drawing two trumps and taking a spade finesse - even with a diamond lead - but not a natural line of play at all|pg||
nt|debrose: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Hi Debbie |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I'm sorry - I had to go away to fix the other match - Looks as if he's lost 3 tricks so far, but I don't know|pg||

nt|debrose: Thanks Jan, who wears many hats|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: And who stupidly forgot that her husband's team had defeated the 1 seed so was the home team in the Finals :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marinesa: yes, he has a rooting interest too|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: did they especially deal the juniors wild distribution?  :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfb: HUdson asks if DBL shows 4 @ss and Green says yes|pg||
nt|debrose: After 1@C-1@D, it is "modern Standard American" for 1@S to imply an unbalanced hand, with opener bypassing a major to bid 1N (or 2N) with balanced hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: South and West are writing notes, perhaps about whether S would skip over diamonds with a 4 card Major, but I can't read it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|reisig: I vote 3@d|pg||
nt|debrose: Given that treatment, it would be clear for responder to preference to clubs over 1@S, but if 1@S can be 4-3-3-3, may be better to bid 1N|pg||
nt|debrose: Also not clear if South should merely preference to 2@C, or should jump to 3@C if that is invitational (as I believe it should be)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: North alerted and is writing, but the bidding box is in between me and the notepad so no chance I'll see it|pg||
nt|debrose: If he alerted, they probably are indeed playing that it shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pbundy: barring a misstep, it looks as if kaplan should gain here|pg||
nt|pbundy: the OTHER kaplan, of course :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hudson: "I can't believe you're getting to play this ... I was hoping for a 5@s bid ... bid 5@s for me next time"|pg||
nt|debrose: Not clear that is alertable, but behind screens it's definitely good to give as much info as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: 2@D would not be an option I'd consider.  How about you Steve?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|reisig: OK ...now 4@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marinesa: brad not too tired to bid here:)|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@D should be a 6 card suit and a minimum responder hand.  Although opener has more than a dead minimum, it would be normal to pass that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sbeatty:  No, if opener promises 4+ clubs, i would stretch to 3C, else 2C|pg||
nt|debrose: However it is also normal to reach game with 15 opposite 10, especially with a couple of 5 card suits, and here they are|pg||
pc|h2|nt|reisig: and the play is easy for +130|pg||
nt|marinesa: piece a cake with the favorable spade layout|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Wu explained his reasoning for bidding 2@h as he wanted to play a 4-4 fit as opposed to a 5-4 :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4@s need a trump lead here?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dude2010: not a modern 1nt opener for Wu|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Would predict the logical line to be to simply start roughing diamonds, if they draw 2 rounds of trumps after the first diamond, still ok?|pg||

nt|debrose: So well done by Wang and Chow, even if they got there differently from the way Steve and I would have|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pbundy: not sure of e/w NT range.  some might be tempted to open 1NT with the east hand even if 15 to 17 range|pg||

mb|p|nt|marinesa: they now need 8 imps a board|pg||
nt|reisig: Looks like a routine hand for 4@s here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 14-16 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 1NT is not value showing - after XX|pg||
nt|reisig: it says ...bail out in a minor|pg||
nt|debrose: I agree, Steve, many would.  A double by West would not be penalty (would just show high cards) so he must pass hoping partner will make a takeout double|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that both of these teams are from the Atlanta area and are a result of the great Junior program Patty Tucker runs in Atlanta|pg||
nt|debrose: Which he can convert to penalty|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: I of course, open 2@s on anything close, although I'll admit that in second seat I might refrain from it|pg||
nt|debrose: North has opening bid strength, but no good bid over 1@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: now wishing she had opened 2@s and gotten it over with|pg||
nt|debrose: While there is a tendency towards making takeout doubles with doubletons in unbid minors these days, with so much in the opponent's suit it is too flawed this time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|reisig: I'd have to be 80 behind to open that hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Gitelman asked Kolesnik whether 1@s showed 5 and he said (or signalled) yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT= minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: With AKJx of hearts and xxx in spades, I think many experts would double, though it's still not standard at all|pg||
nt|debrose: South had the right shape for a takeout double, but was VERY light on strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N passed the double because she doesnt have a clear preference|pg||
nt|hedyg: S could be 6-5|pg||
nt|hedyg: a clear preference= 2 cards more in 1 suit than the other|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I suspect NS don't have this agreement, but many play that RDBL by S would show better diamonds, so 3@c shows either equal suits or better clubs|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  South's double is very aggressive. North will probably be disappointed with dummy, and the bad @H break won't help.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|debrose: His double should show something at least close to an opening hand, and North should clearly bid game - though might had tried 3N instead|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Hudson: "good luck - you hit my suit"|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|debrose: There are some hands with 3-card spade support that would bid 1N forcing - either too weak or too strong for 2@S|pg||

nt|debrose: After 1@S-P-1N-P, 2@S-P-P it is not very attractive for South to "balance" because he does not know the opponents have a fit|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|debrose: While I agree with Wang, it's not clear during the session is the best time to give partner lessons|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: That's something every partnership should decide - whether they can discuss during the session without anyone getting upset or distracted|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: great selfcontrol by Raina!|pg||
nt|debrose: My feeling is it's usually best to just go on to the next hand and try to forget the others until later|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in the OR the 1@d bid was just a negative relay saying nothing about @ds|pg||
nt|debrose: Especially when you have hand records, and in this case even play records!|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|debrose: Here we have a definite slam.  Let see how Green and Rizzo handle this one|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jjbrr:  2@D shows inv or better in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Rizzo is writing a note and Chow hasn't passed the tray over while waiting to read it, so just went over|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and says nothing about @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: not a great slam|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@C would be the natural start with the West hand.  Don't know what 2@D means, and unfortunately our vugraph operator has not been able to read most of the written explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Now Green writing. |pg||
nt|debrose: Thanks Jeremy!|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|debrose: Can you help us with understanding the rest of the auction please?|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  Unfortunately I don't know what these bids mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Since I can't begin to read the notes, I'm afraid, |pg||
nt|debrose: Jan, does it seem that all of these players are comfortable with the screens and related procedures?  I'd imagine it's a first for some of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Green wrote something like "usually short with " and I can't read the rest - I assume that's about 2@h|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  If I had to guess, it makes sense that 2@H is probably some non-minimum, though his hand is light in HCP, it's got extra strength for the distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: They're doing very well - one of the reasons we wanted to hold this Trials face to face was to give them some experience with screens. There are lots of little things (like pushing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: the tray while the EW player is writing) that they don't get, but in general seem comfortable, which is great|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: has 1 good feature --- it makes|pg||
nt|marinesa: that's always the best feature|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I couldn't see whether Fred wrote game force for 2N, but probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H playing by E in OR|pg||
mb|3S|an|!|mb|p|nt|reisig: 4@c must agree @hs and show @c cue - and no @s cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I"m told 2NT was invitational or better, so I guess 4@c says "I accept"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 4@c is an accept in hearts with something in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hudson wrote a long note, but I can't quite read it, sorry |pg||
mb|3N|an|!|nt|hedyg: np :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: and should deny @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: there seems to be a sac in @S for NS if they bid it|pg||
nt|hedyg: but at both tables NS could never enter the bidding|pg||
mb|4H|an|!|nt|hedyg: now EW going overboard|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  Experience with screens at such a young age is extremely valuable.|pg||
nt|debrose: There is a  partition across the table, separating North and East from South and West.  Bids are placed on a tray with is passed to the other side|pg||
nt|debrose: whic|pg||
nt|debrose: which - third time's the charm|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Players alert and explain their own bids to their screenmate|pg||
mb|4N|an|KCB I think|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hedyg: once W showed 8-11 i think he could have just bid 4@H over 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: There are many advantages to playing behind screens, but it's something to get used to.  Since the players will have to do so in the World Championship, it is good as Jan says that ...|pg||
nt|debrose: they are getting the experience|pg||
mb|5N|nt|marinesa: another pickup for the diamond team|pg||
nt|reisig: @c Ace --- will speed things up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Brad is writing out the explanations now, and they look to agree with what I was told and wrote into the bidding box|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I'm not really sure about 4@d, since I couldn't read the 4@c note :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjbrr:  7@C is sort of an interesting contract, though it might be doomed with the bad break. |pg||
nt|debrose: Although we don't know what all the bids mean, we are pretty sure 4N is RKCB in spades, and that Green's 5@S reply shows 2 keycards with the Queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I don't think clubs is a possible trump suit on this auction - far as I can tell they've just been focused on @ss and don't know about the club fit|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: well if it is @d control that is not good news for E who needs @s controls|pg||
nt|hedyg: but probably it SHOWS @s control, nothing about @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: since 4@c denied a @s control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I'm sure it wasn't @d control - was either last train or forced|pg||
nt|debrose: 5N should mean "we have all the keycards, and the Queen of trump", and now we can consider a grand slam|pg||
nt|debrose: With no King to show East has signed off in 6@S|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, there are methods to show voids in response to Blackwood, for example E might have bid 5N to show two keycards and a void|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Rizzo has put his cards on the table and is in "thinker" pose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: But whether or not that is wise depends on the previous bidding.  I would never make that particular bid unless it was going to be clear to partner where the void was|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: It's possible that the heart bids already showed the void, can't tell|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: i think it was @s control maybe|pg||
nt|debrose: We don't know here what the previous bids meant, so can't judge|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I suspect E has shown @H shortness already in the auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfb: unlikely - last train might imply either @d or @s control though and E took a chance|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|debrose: A singleton trump is a lead generally to be avoided|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: with xx in @s and no control in E he would have closed in 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|debrose: If Wang had held, for example, JTxx of spades, Chow's lead would have likely picked up a suit declarer never would have himself|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfb: true, so probably did imply @s control |pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|debrose: There is no 100% safe line of play here, because although declarer knows he CAN pick up clubs for no losers, he doesn't know that he always will|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Kolesnik: "if I didn't lead the club?" Moss: "I had K-ten and he had the J, so I'd still make it" |pg||
nt|debrose: Once declarer ruffed a diamond in dummy he was cold for the slam, and was playing for an overtrick.  Green sensibly played on the assumption that if anyone had Jxxx in clubs it ...|pg||
nt|debrose: would be the player with the singleton spade|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|debrose: Chow's 1@C is natural - only the E-W pair at this table use a strong club opening|pg||
nt|debrose: Rizzo has a textbook takeout double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 1NT f1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|debrose: With the North hand no action is clear.  Some like to ignore the double and go ahead and bid what they would have without it, which for most would be 1@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  NS don't have gambling 3NT marked on their card, so I don't know if that was an option or not. If they have it available, I still prefer 1@C with this hand.|pg||
nt|debrose: It's certainly reasonable to pass though, or even consider 1@D under the circumstances, largely because you prefer a diamond opening lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: so now 2@c can be 3+|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s bid has the advantage of leaving the bidding open|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Our format here is one that Debbie is very familiar with from the Women's Trials, but most people don't see very often. This is the Semi-final of the USA1 bracket, and the winner ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: of this match will go on to the USA1 final. But the loser isn't eliminated, they will play in the semi-final of the USA2 bracket starting this evening and then the winners of that ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: match will play for USA2 tomorrow |pg||
nt|jjbrr:  This event is to select 2 teams for Philadelphia, correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: So we'll have 2 segments of the 48 board USA1 Finals and USA2 Semifinals after the break here, then finish those matches tomorrow morning|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzfb: Kolesnik was hoping his partner would have a stiff club|pg||
nt|reisig: Brad bid 2@s ...not X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: That's what's on the bidding tray :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: also more and more pairs play that 2@c is 2+ here and 2@d 4+|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfb: Moss says: "I only show 4 spades on this auction"|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Gitelman: "well, I'm not sure ... I thought it was a difficult call - if I could see your hand I'd know what to do" Moss: "I think with 5 diamonds you're supposed to bid them" then ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Moss: "would you have doubled with my hand the second time?" Fred: "I think I would have" Brad: "alas, I went more conservativey than you again"|pg||
nt|debrose: Perhaps Rizzo would have bid only 3@H to invite is Chow had passed, but over 3@C thought that would be merely competing|pg||

mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|hedyg: 1@s is easy but what to bid over pd's 2@D?|pg||
nt|debrose: Standard opening would be 1@S - not because they are better, but always the higher with 5-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|debrose: Rizzo starts 1@C because a 1@S opening for them would be limited to <16|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Now he starts natural bidding, having shown 16+|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: 2@s? 3@s? 2NT? 2@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Definitely tough|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfb: G: "the Jack is?" K: "standard"|pg||
nt|debrose: It looks like Wu and Dhir at the other table pushed to 7N on the 6@S hand, and that had very little chance, to give the Rizzo team suddenly a big lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: Grossack bid 2NT and over 3@c by N 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|reisig: now @c ace!|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: There are still five boards left, so 25 IMPs is not insurmountable.  And either way, as Jan explained, the Dhir team keeps playing and still has a chance to qualify|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: why 3NT with @s void and 12 hcps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjbrr:  S has violated one of the rules of bidding here: If you're going to preempt on a hand, do it early, before the opponents get a chance to exchange information.|pg||
nt|debrose: Interesting choice by Chow to pass at first, then come in with a preemptive diamond bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfb: G: any Smith? "no"|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is no time to play on @hs or @ss, so just 4@ds and 3@cs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|debrose: Green has a big entry to hand problem here|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  Particularly against a strong club, which is artifical and can contain a lot of different hand types, it's an effective strategy to overcall a little lighter than normal to make the auction harder for the opponents|pg||
nt|debrose: Even on a diamond lead, where he'd be in hand to play a club toward dummy, he would never be able to get back to the good clubs|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|h7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|debrose: E-W are way too high here in any game, but hard to fault anyone too much.  If East's @DA had been the far more useful @CA, either 4@H or 5@C would have play|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Juniors in Istanbul last year, where I think they were on the team that won the bronze in the BAM, but not positive|pg||
mb|3N|nt|debrose: Some do play 2@D as non forcing, so perhaps that wasn't available, but that would be unusual|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: South probably meant 3@S to ask for a stopper - could have accomplished the same with 2@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Neither of them alerted 3@h so I don't think it was a transfer|pg||

nt|debrose: East might jump to 4@H with the four card support and favorable vulnerability.  South should 4@S either way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: In spite of the favorable vulnerability, E-W do not have a profitable sacrific available in 5@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfb: This event chooses 2 teams, so the losers will continue here|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 1225|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 10 min|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: N, last of this half - they still have 16 to play in the semi-final match. Then a break and then 32 boards of a 48 board final in the USA1 bracket and semi-final in the USA2 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: bracket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: The open players are a little behind, despite playing only 15 boards - I don't know whether we'll restart a bit after both of the Junior matches have finished or wait for the Open ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: so there won't be too much noise|pg||
nt|debrose: What a close and exciting match|pg||
nt|debrose: E-W being vulnerable is good for Dhir fans here - a better chance of a big enough swing to catch up|pg||
mb|1C|an|STR, ART, F|nt|jjbrr:  NS need a vulnerable game swing here, and this is a good board to swing on. I think 4@H is down while 3NT will make|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C!|an|!ds|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: I do know that we'll cover the other match for the second half here, unless it looks very one-sided|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  3@C looks like it shows @D and GF|pg||
nt|debrose: Wang's 2@C bid is natural, because the 1@C bid is artificial|pg||
nt|debrose: As bad as his clubs are, he wants to get in the auction, if nothing else to interfere over a strong club|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vdoubleu: Good!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ambiguous 1@d opening, they play strong @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: BOth E & W are writing notes - probably that E could have 54 in the minors either way, but I can't actually see|pg||
nt|debrose: He also has a nice playing hand if he can find a fit in either clubs or spades|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: Das did not find the K@C lead in OR to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In the other rm, there was no porblem for N/S to get to game|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Adam (K) opened it w/1D (as North)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I wouldn't open it playing 2/1|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but playing precision, it's a must :)|pg||
nt|dude2010: he says|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Thanks for tha tinfo:)))|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, ofc|pg||
nt|debrose: 3@C showed diamonds, and West is making what appears to be a winning choice to bid 3N rather than hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Chow's aggressive 4@C bid would be too much for me, but could win the match for his team as it turns out!|pg||
nt|debrose: It is good to sacrifice aggressively at favorable vulnerability, but 2 general problems both seem potentially applicable with Chow's hand|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  Green is put into a tough spot|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Even after a non club K lead, you have to guess the clubs, unless hte opps cash|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, I'm off, later|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ye Adam :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 6 IMPs away here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 61-50|pg||
nt|dude2010: 21 imps with 16 boards left|pg||
nt|debrose: You can go down too many when game is making, or you might have enough defense to set their game|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  W didn't bid 3@H, so his hearts probably can't be as good as they actually are|pg||
nt|debrose: As it turns out however, Chow got them out of a makeable game into an unmakeable one|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I suppose Green infered that the 4@H bid had to imply some @D support and an offer to play in two different places|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, Jeremy, that makes sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: ty Jan was fun |pg||
nt|dude2010: 71*|pg||
nt|debrose: West has no reasonable option at this point but to pass.  On a good day 5@D might make, especially since South is unlikely to lead a spade on this auction, but not this time|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vdoubleu: srry 71-50|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jjbrr:  S could have rubbed some salt into the wound by doubling this, but he did the damage already with his winning 4@C bid|pg||
