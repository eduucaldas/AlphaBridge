nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, set and ready to go|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon from England|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: canape sequesnce it seems |pg||
nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||
nt|mamos: english pair 4 card majors natural style|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwi_joker: Madala in a comon position for us all .. not want to sell out to 2@S|pg||

nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: witam wszystkich|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
pc|dK|nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
pc|hA|nt|antoniz: bilans sto³u zosta³ zgubiony,trudno|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Pekka, Ben and everyone:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and anti-percentage slam to start with|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy|pg||
nt|pasker: Yes always relieving to see game going down as well if you are not doubled|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: S needs to shift to @H else @S finesse will protect @HK and will make|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry wszystkim sympatykom bryd¿a a dru¿yny polskiej w szczególnoci|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Balicki seems very displeased with his dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: This all assumes that defense do not cash hearts first|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a sick contract no matter what|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT needs close to dd defense to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he could not have made game either|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bagman: This works fine but exposes the @SK|pg||

nt|sybarra: South is a "she" for eveyone's info |pg||

nt|Walddk2: But as Pekka said, it takes a good defence to beat 3NT|pg||

mb|4H|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||

nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||

nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||

nt|hedyg: David are you implying that Lohay should have ruffed with the jack?|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer lacks entries for the double hook in diamonds, så with this fortunate lay-out, 12 tricks are possible. 4 H as the Italians reached is a decent spot as well|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 5H shows all the aces and heart support- Easts only concern is 3rd round diamond - but he will bid 7 for sure|pg||

nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||
nt|mbruun: These guys are professionals|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Anyone for Michaels with that North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe reach 7H|pg||
nt|mamos: control showing response|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: wg mnie to spory blad powiedziec 1 ba - E po 2 treflach opsa da kontre T.o a spasuje na 2kier, 2 karo |pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict 6 though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
mb|4C|an|*|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 clubs is?   |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wonder what 3@S would've been|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: ²»ÊÇºÜÏ²»¶Õâ¸ö 3@D|pg||

nt|brolucius: Is the 1@H rebid forcing, David?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: East might figure out that leading a diamond might give the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: pokazujac sile ok 9 PC|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess they're cuebids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think clubs would take 16|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: lol at the Impage :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: a wish trick |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin's comment breaches copyright, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||

mb|1S|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: well 3N was stiff? Only from North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great Dane you mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 1@s alerted as it may be canape (Walsh)|pg||
nt|atabey: it was the first blood indeed. only the other side :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, they said 10 first then 11... :(|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: minors break badly tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6N is a decent spot. Without a diamond lead its wash, and otherwise you have to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|rodvenn: was 1 sp alerted?|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did find Madala with two beautiful cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, it mustn't have registered on BBO|pg||

nt|paulg:  true, but 5@d the practical call|pg||

nt|andyv:  and W did miss a chance to really muddle things up by not bidding 3@h on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like North took 4NT as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 3@s was the ideal bid|pg||

nt|jtr: for those that are interested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also available for those who are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have a Bocchi0Duboin convention card up and 1@S shows diamonds for that partnership. Cannot find one for this partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||

nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||

nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking probably not a winner but Madala is unaware of the bad splits|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||

nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||

nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||

nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||

nt|mamos: looking at all four hands  this looks straightforward enough|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ryskiel_: sorry 2@H -  3@C  mialo byæ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
pc|sA|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
pc|h7|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||

nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||

nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||

nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 5@ds, 4@s and 1@c|pg||

nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until we see 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||

nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs to Italy on 7. The Italians found the defence against 3NT. @HQ to the ace and a diamond switch|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||

nt|pasker: but has worked out well enough here|pg||
nt|vasmar: first seat you mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's all you have in your arsenal, you may as well use it|pg||
nt|bagman: W comes in with 4NT?|pg||

nt|bagman: IT cannot be S thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W blocking out all sound now, hands over his eyes and fingers in his ears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may talk N into bidding on|pg||
nt|bagman: over 4NT N can bid on with X|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|2N|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: another canape sequence here |pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
pc|s5|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||
nt|bagman: ok the old trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie wszyscy majatak¹ szansê- niektorzy np Francuzi graja ,¿e 2 tref i po 2 karach 2 kier jest inwituj¹ce|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: S put lead to dummy to score the @CK|pg||
nt|sybarra: just not my style |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||

nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||

nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: You were right Mike, the tables have turned ;)|pg||
nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Strange, everyone says -1 but I'm sure the play went as it went...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||
nt|mamos: Blue Club type strong Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasted into it at other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict they will reach it here now|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||

nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
nt|xenya: over the double|pg||
nt|bogier: na przebitki jest 12|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has too many primes to pass if W raises|pg||
nt|mamos: surely now|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||

nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 tricks off the top and a 6th if they don't squander their @d communications|pg||
nt|andyv:  N on lead so trot out his AK@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: If NS are happy with their methods, I see no reason why we should judge them|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At least you qualified, unlike Sweden and Norway, who have been strong in the past.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||

nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||

nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@d= 5+@hs 4-18|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@c may be Drury or natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: South can place declarer with a double stopper in clubs and is considering if he can cast his net elsewhere.|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer needs to play reasonably well to go one down.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 2@D= 8+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We had a 5-0 this morning; unfortunately for Denmark, the Danish player bid his 5-card suit and kept the opponents out of their 4-4 fit|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Ciao Giorgio|pg||

pc|h4|nt|atabey: for the turkish spectators: our women team is up 46-1 for now. I thk against the chech republic|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||

nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Zorlu play another @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes and declarer played the @Cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||

nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: If North has the J9 of trumps, the contract is down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Was 5 originally, but an appeal gave both teams 2 VPs back|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: had another chance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodvenn: and if he has the Jack +x declarer may make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  eventually he will lead trump|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: The equation is simple now, although no doubt South expects the spade finesse to fail|pg||

nt|marlowepi: small error by declarer, and this is a valuable technical point -- as E in this situation you do NOT want to lead the 7-spot on the second round. always lead from the top in these ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: situations, so that the person showing out of trumps doesnt know how many trump tricks the defence have coming. often makes no difference, but good to get in habit of playing right ...|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||

nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||

nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||

nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: can he get the pitches |pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||

nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will roll now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was always rolling i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: with ace of @D on side yes |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had five double-figure swings to Italy on the first six boards. Since then only a dribble of IMPs. A margin 51 or more is needed for a maximum win in VPs.   |pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: spad to the six?|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s9|nt|capercliff: will he go the right way?|pg||
nt|bogier: nasi 2 BA wygraj¹|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: played from the other side,  and declarer got overruffed in @H's |pg||
nt|mamos: it wont here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|d2|nt|capercliff: when W plays the J@d he can equally have the Q|pg||
nt|capercliff: so it looks to me that either hand can have lenght in @s's|pg||
nt|capercliff: this could be important in terms of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might consider playing the K@d then 4 rounds of @c's, but that doesnt really help him here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: unlesss|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andy_h: Fair enough.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he is vuln !|pg||

nt|brolucius: I see that Versace (West at the other table) also responded 3@C.|pg||
nt|bogier: ....mam nadziejê.....|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh |pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: The deals have been strangely subdued, in all three sessions that I have watched from this event. (No bonus should be paid to the provider of the auto-dealer).|pg||
nt|bagman: They stood in 3NT XX. Right lead and -9 or something. Wrong lead (made) and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: He's going to cash out and hope for something nice to happen for -1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: Nothing happens, though and it's going to be -2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, crap|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obviously only +1|pg||
nt|daman: yes   110|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andy_h: I wonder if it's worth to advertise declarer's shape to the opponents when usually the most likely contract will be 3NT after declarer has denied a 4 card major|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|mamos: declarer plays like this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Lauria did not overruf with a sure trump trick. In many cases that's the sound policy|pg||
nt|pasker: he did start with 3 @Ss|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Turkey made 6@C doubled on this deal, I am told.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: i think this was a lot harder than it looked|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: so much easier for us |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all |pg||
nt|mamos: forcing East early was always likelt tto leave declarer short of tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, we'll be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure when next session starts but I am about to leave for long drive|pg||
