pc|s5|pg||
nt|bbramley: @SQ, in a photo with a heart - i have not problem with leading from ace-fourth|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer will test diamonds and then set up his hearts losing 3 tricks here|pg||
nt|jlall: for now he has to consider whether he will duck the lead or not, if he does hes vulnerable to a club shift but the defense has to find it|pg||

nt|jlall: bob might just open 2@S here r/w|pg||
nt|bbramley: not a fan|pg||
nt|jlall: he is pretty conservative at this vul|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bbramley: 3@S for me, or just pass if my suit is weaker|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jlall: i like stansbys X|pg||
nt|bbramley: three hearts will deter some people|pg||
nt|jlall: at the 1 or 2 level you should overcall your 5 card suit, but at a higher level it's better to keep everything in play|pg||
nt|jlall: imo|pg||
nt|bbramley: i agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jlall: by everything in play I mean, clubs, diamonds, or a penalty pass from partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: stansby is not showign a massive hand here, because martel showed values with his 3@D bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: clear 3@H call after partner shows values|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: with a bad hand he would have bid 2N, lebensohl|pg||
nt|flash: 5@D in the Open Room on 62, so 5 more IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|jlall: 3N looks like a make|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein had a way to show a singleton spade but felt his hand was not good enough. If his spade Q had been elsewhere. he would have bid different;y|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jlall: since you can shut hamman out|pg||
nt|bbramley: lucky make when spades go 7-2 instead of 6-3, AND east has all of the other relevant high cards|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: if spades are 7-2, then hamman probably has nothing else|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding and leads, obvious shift|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|bbramley: the lead (when north has the 9) and east's failure to raise both suggest the 7-2 split|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and smith echo, high from either side says likes the suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: Meckwell are playing 4@D, after they got Xd in 3NT|pg||
nt|jlall: hi mildred|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi, everyone :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if i were playing all four positions the contract would be 5@D:  3@S-P-4@S-DBL-P-5@D|pg||
nt|jlall: full disclosure... all commentators here are texan so bob hamman is our god ;)|pg||
nt|bbramley: hi mildred|pg||
nt|bbramley: as well as my boss|pg||
nt|jlall: wow bart, if it went 3S X 4S X p i would pass and lead my stiff heart and expect to get a huge number|pg||
nt|jlall: no wonder you bid so much, you dont X yourself :P|pg||
nt|jlall: it was a good double by steve in the other room, i wonder if he did it to get them to run|pg||
nt|bbramley: this time you would, but next time south will have VOID-KQxxx-KQxx-Axxx and west will be void in diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: weinstein is very successful/famous in the poker world, so whenever he Xs a 3N and they run and it's cold I think he played poker|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's a good ploy to double 3NT when you have no idea if they can make it|pg||
nt|bbramley: if they sit you hope to beat it, and if they run to 4 of a minor you'll be happy regardless|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i agree, it ups the stakes tremendously for them and only a little bit for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hamman still thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm a little surprised that meck ran - he plays a little poker himself|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman knows its right to shift since he has no entry to his suit, unfortunately it looks like there is no promising shift|pg||
nt|jlall: sometimes in this situation its right to just set up your suit as a bluff like you have an entry, but here it is futile|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - every shift helps declarer - even a diamond creates an extra entry in diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mildredb: need to do that quicker ;)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|bbramley: he couldn't afford to guard against KJx with east - no reentry|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|flash: many pairs these days don't have a weak 2@D call available; that might have led to the swing on 62|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bbramley: this will be 7 imps to fleisher:  400 vs 130|pg||
nt|jlall: he can play ace of clubs club to the 9 and if it's ducked he can run his diamonds and exit a club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure about 4@D :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Uh-oh, does that mean 15 mins of play?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 4@d must be Q-bid & general forward-going (slammish)?|pg||

nt|bigtrain: considering the 4@S bid i think it's a fragment|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Patterning out hand?|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: So Stevie put the brakes on w/his club values.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|flash: also, Ira, some players won't show the singleton if it's a King or Queen - those potentially combine too powerfully with honors in the opposite hand|pg||
nt|flash: my kind of weak 2!!!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlall: if they bid it, they can make it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|flash: interesting situation for Levin - even with the 4-card @S suit, he doesn't want to let West in cheaply|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: they can double hook diamonds pitching a heart, and then ruff a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one line|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bbramley: 3@H is smolen, showing 5@S and 4@H - it's another way to transfer the declarership to the notrump hand|pg||
nt|flash: looks like a McCabe situation - any suit call other than a raise would have been a lead-director and showed @H support|pg||
nt|flash: so the raise implies that leading the pre-empted suit is safe|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though a ruffing finesse in @Ds will see declarer home on this one?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jlall: if 4@D shows shape, then zia will be turned off by short clubs with partner|pg||
nt|flash: but it's not the most comfortable contract we've seen|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: if 4@D is just a cue, zia will still like his hand|pg||

nt|flash: welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry there were 4 9's i clicked on wrong one|pg||
nt|flash: oh to be playing baccarat...|pg||
nt|chorush: He needs the ruffing finnesse in diamonds and something more; he has 3 uncovered spot cards in his hand and th diamonds will take care of only 2. Still I think he can make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: lead is standard and ambiguos|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer has to fight to ruff the third heart in dummy, and be happy to be overruffed -- but the diamond lead and threatenedoverruff kills that plan|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how it makes -- what are his 10 tricks?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bbramley: or might take a club finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chorush: was a heart led? I had tought so|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jlall: 4@H just means he doesn't have the worst hand (some slam interest)|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman had nothing extra for his 1 slam try so he quit|pg||
nt|bbramley: this is the right spot - slam is mediocre, even though you can make it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall: yeah definitely|pg||
nt|flash: couldn't afford the 2nd round of trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|kit: declarer ca takeruffing finesse in diamonds, but then Levin has long trump left|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|jlall: a 23 HCP game here that doesn't look cold at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I believe the hand could be made on a double dummy basis, at least|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell gets his lead-direcctor in|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jlall: i guess you can pitch your diamond loser on the spade to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: but will make handily - @S overcall indicates @SA with north|pg||
nt|flash: 63 and 64 in as pushes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jlall: bidding it should be easy after a 1@C opener and a support double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|jlall: so to make declarer will pop ace, pull trumps ending in hand, and lead a spade up|pg||
nt|jlall: eventually pitching their @D on the @SK, and then leading a club up|pg||
nt|bbramley: better win the ace, not because of the impending ruff but for fear of a diamond shift|pg||
nt|flash: too many cards off-side here?|pg||
nt|flash: even with the @HT making an early appearance|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|kit: Declarer can go after hearts, but still only 2 hearts, 4 diamonds, 2 spades it appears|pg||

nt|chorush: this is a rare occsion when Nickell can see enough entries in his own hand to establish his weak suit|pg||
nt|flash: the defense will have 5 tricks without the long @D?|pg||
nt|chorush: no his entries will establish the fifth diamond while he still has one entry left|pg||

mb|4S|nt|jlall: so he doesn't really want to go past 3N|pg||
nt|mittmouse: another example of how active competition can make it easier to unearth your great fit|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein is likely to bid 5S if, in their methods that asks for 6 with heeart control|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: but stansby might have bid again - his hand doesn't look real notrumpy|pg||
nt|jlall: true but he has long hearts|pg||
nt|bbramley: same auction both rooms - some hands are just too tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Martel is smiling|pg||
nt|chorush: or he might assume heart shortness and just bid it|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|chorush: in some partnerships 5S is a command, in others it is a suggestion|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein should be able to picture his partner's exact hand if he trusts the enemy bidding|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mittmouse: y a great push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: The 5@S call presumably needs a heart control, since if Weinstein had a heart control he could have Q-bid 5@H instead|pg||

nt|jlall: 4@D is not a slam try, it is just to help partner judge what to do if the opps bid 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jlall: also NS play weak NT, so north's 2H showed abotu a strong NT with 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mildredb: diamond had 64 lead w/ 3 comparisions to come in|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: in fact, it is only that the 3 card trump holding would ruff the diamond that keeps it from being a beat|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|nt|mildredb: *has|pg||
nt|gavin:  we might see him go an extra down by attempting to take more entries with a diamond to the T|pg||
nt|gavin:  he needs to trump dummies spades and cant get there enough|pg||
nt|gavin:  so he will likely try to manufacture some extra entries in @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  that or spin the T@D right now|pg||
nt|gavin:  try to come home with 4@D 4@H in dummy and 2 in his hand|pg||

pc|d5|nt|flash: while this is playing out, thnx to Serge Bondar, our operator, for a great job|pg||
nt|flash: and to our commentators for guiding us through the boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jlall: better spin it now|pg||
nt|passell: a rare opportunity to see these great teams meeting|pg||
pc|d6|nt|flash: Diamond now up 98 over Weinstein, so that match is unlikely to go the distance|pg||
nt|chorush: barring anything wild on board 75, this set is going to end up with a baseball score (American league, at least)|pg||
nt|passell: you are the designated hitter Ira|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|jlall: hes just going for 3-3 diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chorush: i was the designated punching bag when we played Nick|pg||
pc|c5|mc|10|nt|gavin:  easy cover for zia here in @D|pg||
nt|jlall: now zia can cover the diamond|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think that is what he is thinking about now|pg||
nt|gavin:  if he plays all his hearts zia will have to discard the K@C|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: 8 tricks seems to be the limit here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: disciplined 2N from Weinstein|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in college that game try was always accepted, so we redefined it as SLAM try|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we went down a lot in college|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|caitlin: so after this final board of day, check out closed room as they have more boards to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I guess maybe play for game if no @s switch|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 8 isn't automatic|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|caitlin: and thanks to Adam our operator, Al Walter, Valerie USBF BBO and you specs!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks everyone, I think I will have 2 segments off tomorrow|pg||
nt|caitlin: good for you!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yeah, I decided I should rest "a bit"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: last board in this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will resumed in 5-7 mins|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|alert|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kit: Light opening bids on hands like South has are often effective, but this time will get them overboard as in open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gavin:  what an ugly hand to lead from |pg||
nt|gavin:  complete guesswork|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gavin:  good choice|pg||
nt|mildredb: great lead|pg||
nt|jlall: usually a major is good here, but usually Jxx is terrible|pg||
nt|jlall: so that was his problem heh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein might consider passing 3@D.  The problem is that his 2@C is game-forcing, so he partner could have a really strong hand and not need to jump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin:  the Q@S was a better technical play by stansby|pg||
nt|gavin:  need to keep the communication in the spade suit open|pg||
nt|chorush: will Katz eschew his diamonds for the unbid suit?|pg||
nt|flash: don't wander too far, folks; apparently a good chance to start again in advance of scheduled time...|pg||
nt|chorush: obviously i had no idea who was on lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|scotty: If Stansby flies with the second black ace.....|pg||
nt|mildredb: does N get squeezed in minors?|pg||
nt|gavin:  NS play attitude leads|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like one of those unfortunate 3NT hands where declarer is shut out of both his hand and dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|passell: down 2 is good bridge for declarer|pg||
nt|chorush: if Nick can find a duck here they might beat it more than 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gavin:  so south needed to be a little concerned that his partner may have Jxxxx and that declarer has stiff K|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Nickell is afraid that if he ducks declarer can switch to clubs and have enough tricks with the spade trick stolen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|passell: he took the cinch|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  this line of play didndt work out well for hamman|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't see a way that a club pitch would cost|pg||
nt|bbramley: i thought of one - if south has @CKx and @DQ, then a club pitch allows the 4th club to set up|pg||
nt|gavin:  for news and articles abt the trials and europeans and other bridge stuff pls chk out my website www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|curtis: looks like brad moss was the only one to make 3n on this board|pg||
nt|bbramley: many kibs argue that south must have @CA, else he's have played @SQ at trick one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|chorush: as would I|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|s6|mc|8|nt|flash: thnx again, all; back soon|pg||
nt|flash: scheduled in 20 minutes; may be sooner|pg||
nt|chorush: the oponents can start earlier than the announced start time for the segment if both teams agree to|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We do have a 20 minutes break, that was mixed-up with clock in our room|pg||
nt|chorush: at least, they could in the earlier rounds. if they are using duplicated boards they might not be able to|pg||
nt|flash: 20 minutes it is...   hope to see you all back then|pg||
