nt|caitlin: what are Green's options?|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dougdscsu: good thing to talk about with your partner|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 3nt on a heart lead and diamond shift, has a chance?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: EW's styles appear to be in sync, for a vulnerable 2@H overcall to simply give a single raise with 4 trump and 12 hcp, is amazing :), Dang knows his partner well, sells to 3@s :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Welcome to Sean & Andre!!|pg||
nt|dude2010: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: And thanks for stopping in today;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Oftentimes very difficult for begging players to diagnose misfit hands, oftentimes the best strategy is to get out as low as possible, don't dig the hole any deeper|pg||
nt|dredog03: Good morning!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 4@s is cold, on the north south cards, chance for an early pickup|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dredog03: If NS use maximal doubles, this would be a good opportunity for N to use that over 3@h as a game invite and 3@s as purely competitive.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|caitlin: what are 2@D and 2N?|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: This is especially true of younger players---do not mean to be stereotypical or biased here:) But based on my yrs of working w/the Jnrs I have notiiced this running theme|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Fortunately the west at the other table decided to value his 11 count as a 1@s opener and jump to 3@s, thus, simmilar trouble occuring in the closed room ;)|pg||

nt|dredog03: 4 loser hand for N. 6@d is not a bad contract on these cards but I expect they will wind up in 3nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 6@d here is a "reasonable contract", only requires 3-3 spades and or a club lead, |pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: I am not sure I wld have bid 3@h, whatever the alert was|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dougdscsu: has to stay off the ace of @s lead|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes, esp[ecially since he had hoped paertner had learned his lesson, hopefully, he will rmeember it, only 1 board ago:)|pg||
nt|dude2010: he might be looking for revenge... on his partner|pg||
nt|dude2010: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: K or A@c depending on the method seems safe|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: this will probably end in 800|pg||
mb|4C|an|Gerber|nt|vdoubleu: But now the problem is , he is thinking:"Did my 3@h guarantee spade support?"|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yup!!!|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H!|an|One Ace|nt|dredog03: you have options on playing for @h 3-3 or @s 3-3. and if a spade is led, a @s finesse.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Would hope that Das ignores his own lead directing double against slam, i would suspect he will|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: but wont be too costly for EW as 4S is cold on the NS cards|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|vdoubleu: That was the problem w/the 3@h bid|pg||
nt|dude2010: "sorry p"|pg||
nt|dredog03: @c lead is certainly not attractive.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: Can make on this lead|pg||
mb|5H!|an|1 king|nt|dredog03: isnt this an automatic @h lead?|pg||
nt|dredog03: i guess that cancels the first double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: das simply doubles a second time because he can|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Yes!!!|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Some lead:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: which major to play to be 3-3, as andre explained, same contract :)|pg||
nt|dredog03: interesting to see which suit he plays for breaking 303|pg||
nt|dredog03: i would play for @s 3-3 because you're slightly more likely to lead from a 2 or 4 card suit than 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i would hazard a wild guess that he may draw an inference from the lead and attack spades, but it's just a guess|pg||
nt|dredog03: of course, with a JT, @h is a fairly safe lead whatever your length|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: tools like gerber and RKC are for jokers :p|pg||
nt|jlrice: Rizzo had no reason to invistigate slam as Green opened a 12-15 NT    at the other table the same hand showed a 15-17 point hand making slam more likely|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: he probably bid 6@c because he wasn't comfortable with his agreements with his partner in that scenario|pg||

mb|2H|nt|dredog03: seemed like a clear 2@h bid to me but 2@h doesn't make so not bad after all|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4@s is certainly a good contract, 5@c, not quite as much|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Garbage Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Will require a spade lead to set 3nt, in the event it is reached|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: with a good trick source and qxx, in @c, imagine andrew will go for it|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: 2@c was a 1 suited hand im guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: 2@d was a relay to find out what suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Rizzo nibbling away at the lead here towards the end :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dredog03: garbage stayman doesn't promise 5-4, only 4-4|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I wld think bidding 2@s wld be auto|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That's what I meant|pg||
nt|dude2010: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Ricoh alerted as promising 5@h|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So it is incumbenton West to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|dredog03: so the face that the alert says 5-4, they might be playing 2@h here as invitational..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a true garbage stayman would pass 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: OK, if that is hteir agreement--OK--but not standard|pg||

nt|dredog03: stretching to 3NT here isn't going to work out well.|pg||
nt|dude2010: a little agresive by Das here i think|pg||
