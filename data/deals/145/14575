mb|p|nt|andreasw:  5@h wins here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Bulgaria in 4th place after 8 matches, Croatia 8th, so both teams on an qualifiyng place|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least not the Israeli ones :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: The first 5 or 6 qualify for the bermuda bowl|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: they still reach to game |pg||
nt|jeanhari: NS bidding too much here|pg||
nt|iyer7550: the void seems to have propelled north to overassess his hand. |pg||
nt|bjurn:  since they were seated in the same direction yesterday the TD decided to replay this match|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jameslee 2: j@D lead |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks like -1  9 tricks |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: simon|pg||

pc|s6|nt|april7: since S didn't have any ruffing value,she raised NT to 2 and N passed ofcourse with minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk12: East is  Bekkouche|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hello Robin and Andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 1 board bekkouche is playing 3@d:) hello Roland|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Sjoberg should have bid 3@h with that hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning from a sunny sweden!|pg||
nt|spooky: Israel standing 4th before this match and Russia 11th. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: start off with an unremarkable 1n which is notg likely to make|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: how is weather in Ostende ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: the England team has only one (playing) change|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe it's Ginossar and Pachtman playing here for Israel|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Yuval and Gerbrand!|pg||
nt|yuval10: as EW|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: 3@H probably -2 but 3@S makes|pg||
nt|Walddk12: West's full name is Binderkrantz but there is no room for  -tz  only 10 characters fit in|pg||
nt|iyer7550: ohh my. that was much more than what i expected. |pg||
nt|yuval10: if we can change their names, plz?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Ralf|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: that may be an understatement|pg||
nt|jaapfr: welcome to Maarten Schollardt|pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy dbl for east :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|copeyj: I think the Romanian team is also very similar|pg||
nt|spooky: Yuval, did you ever do it yourself? it's quite hard when they play fast|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|iyer7550: even 5diamond was going to be axed. |pg||
nt|yuval10: i did it dozens of times actually|pg||
nt|yuval10: but thx for asking :)|pg||
nt|spooky: that's a really helpfull lead for South, but I still don't see a way how he can make this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: the irish can cash another ten tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if... they.... want....!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: extra a:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skollie: hi all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with this lucky layout 4@S even makes|pg||
nt|skollie: with this friendly breaks, Paulissen will make 3@s|pg||
nt|april7: N is not yet home, but might succeed with 2@S,1 @H 3 @D and 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: It has been nice and sunny, but today is overcast|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: small to Q of @H and @D finesse,@D and @D and  and then to Q of @C, lets see|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S 3-3 and @D 2-2 some 15% game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The only lead which enables the contract to make-bad luck. The declarer has no entry to finesse.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: the last trick for poor townsend i fear|pg||
pc|hT|nt|iyer7550: 4d was the limit for this hand. |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iyer7550: south's free 2@c must have enthused north to visualise a slam|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think there was some misunderstanding about the  trump suit|pg||
nt|jeanhari: south 4@D OR 5@C must have been a cue in north's eyes, but even then he overbid |pg||
nt|iyer7550: guess both will have a lot of explaining to do when their team mates meet after the match. '|pg||
nt|iyer7550: certainly not a good beginning. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|jeanhari: rooms not linked yet cause in the other room the result is in, 3@H E -1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a normal 4@H and a normal down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But should not make with still 3 losers.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: oh h had a sixth sense|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 3@H would have been more lucrative if X (-2 = 300)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: at least for EW:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well-if you manage to play from north, its harder to beat|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: and gains 2 imps for cashing the dim and giving up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: exactly|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer needs  to decide who has the A@c |pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: if W has it then declarer can play some more @h's for a strip-squeeze|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|april7: 1 imp for Germany|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|yuval10: but he's going for the winning line|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: fine play for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|andersk: fireworks|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Remind me to tell you what  zz  is later|pg||
nt|anthonyf: 5H for me, too tame to pass|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andersk: Justin didnt bid 5@H, understandeble in these vouln, in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|bagman: Understandable but it's hard to get to hearts unless S bids them|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bagman: Too much to expect N to reopen|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer needs to find the @SQ for 12 tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|anthonyf: East can find S started with seven hearts and will then misguess spades, more of relevance one level higher|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SQ8653HA9762D8CJ5,SJT4HQ53DKQ4CQ932,S972HKJT8D73CKT74,SAKH4DAJT9652CA86|sv|n|nt|lestergold: first speck of bllod to eng|pg||
nt|lestergold: blood|pg||
nt|lestergold: bit of a misfit here especially for n/s who had better not get too frisky in the aution especially at this vulnerablity|pg||
nt|lesniak: buras narkiewicz byli trochê "pechowi" bo s mogl miec to samo w karach co mial w treflach i bylaby inna rozmowa|pg||

nt|yuval10: 1@d P P X 1NT ....|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I am told that the four Romanian players who are playing here all played in Beijing but in different partnerships|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: thanks to Florin Safta|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  possible slam here, depends on finding the Sq|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: an impossible to reach 6 @D by N|pg||
nt|copeyj: have to avoid getting too high here - should not be too difficult|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a 3nt contract|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this looks like an unlucky slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you x NT?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldn't|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: it goes off:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so a bad start for 4th placed Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N has a balanced hand, so it´s not only balacing for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you tried 5@h as S?|pg||
nt|jillan:  didn't want to I think :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  2 s and 1 C|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I would probably, being wrong about it most of the time |pg||
nt|jillan:  6 loser hand? vulnerable? |pg||
nt|jillan:  It is not even good for 4 H  fniss|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some players hate preempts:)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 10 or 11 tricks depends on the lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: good lead from Gold|pg||
nt|copeyj: but to no avail|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS pretty much the same, with a loose club |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: claim 10 |pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania "right sided" 4@H on b1 so gained a game swing when Sandqvist led a @D at T2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no play |pg||
nt|iyer7550: guess this is what we call in tennis an unforced error.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably majors and I have good stoppers in minors|pg||

nt|kippari: olisiko pari helppoa voittoa tänään tiedossa:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to go down here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but 9 tricks not easy|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@d is supposed to show 5cards or 4441 - but third in hand Jansma didn't want to pass (or open 1@c...)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: doess EW play same sys as drijver-Brink?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and also a balancing in vul!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lesniak: watpie niezwykle|pg||

nt|rmb1: EW play natural with (mainly) weak NT.  1m is natural (3)4+|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: 1st favourable.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has no S in his name.|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: thk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, this is the 9-12 version, and NS have elected to try to penalise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as against that, EW are probably in an 8 card fit, which means the double could be shaded, and S surely has 5 hearts. so at these colors i think there is a strong case for 2H|pg||
nt|lesniak: przeciez nie wie czy przeciwnicy nie zostali juz przeciagnieci a jest na bezposredniej pozycji|pg||
nt|lesniak: powiedzialbym ze wybitnie niefartowne rozdanie|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i think it will|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here unluckily it is wrong sided - 4nt not safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E will not enjoy discarding twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can safely discard clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if declarer plays 2 top diamonds it is over|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is that an abovious line|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when q@d drops does that deny the J!?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he discards clubs declarer's task is easy as little temptation to try club hook|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but there is restricted choice, plus some possibility that with diamonds that good he might have led one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he cashes his hearts East will be forced to make at leas 1 club discard and declarer will guess to play on diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possibe Victor but he has to play well if he is to makem this|pg||
nt|april7: a small swing for Germany  by making 3 @C losing only 1 trick in every suit|pg||

nt|iyer7550: i was shocked to see a 3nt from west. |pg||

nt|rnmalik: Playing 6, A@C I think.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: good lead 2@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how can south bid 2 dia, you know simon?|pg||
nt|copeyj: because they play 4 card suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when they have 4cM and weak NT they open 1M|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 1@D is often 5 for them|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so that promisses 3+ with an honour?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gerber ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: i dont think it "promises" that|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: ok so just a 3 card raise- thx|pg||
nt|copeyj: he wants partner to lead @D if partner on lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a few values|pg||
nt|copeyj: this looks like down 1 in any case|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i meant with promising an honour:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: it just seems normal to run hearts then play 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there is a late discard coming in spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania credited with 10 tricks here on board 2 - but looks unlikely because they claimed at T1 and there were only 9 then|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so ns must keep playing dia |pg||
nt|rmb1: I suspect a pass is missing?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  yes and N-S reach 6@h -1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: diamond 7 asking for spade|pg||

nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 6@h E-W here:)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: peter has to be under pressure now|pg||
nt|bjurn:  8, I think|pg||
nt|jillan:  where there is 8 there is 9|pg||
nt|jillan:  an old Swedish saying....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: he must know about the singel @d to know how to evaluate his hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if LHO does have QJx of diamonds there is still the spade king onside possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see this failing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but then i dont see my own failings either:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes since WEst has at least 8 major cards playing diamonds looks natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can we call that a profesional play simon?|pg||

nt|copeyj: i hope he doesn't try to underlead his @DK to partner's (non existant) @D10|pg||

nt|copeyj: he knows townsend has either K or Q of @H|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: so whichever it is|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can beat the contract by playing K@D and another @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be the queen of dia wasnt the right card earlier|pg||
nt|copeyj: although i suppose if townsend had dry Q@H left declarer could ruff high and then crash the @H honours|pg||
nt|copeyj: so maybe that is not true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he must be thinking all his posibilitys |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 imps is the difference here of making or -1- alot for a harmless looking 2 hearts|pg||

nt|ralfwil: is easts hand worth a 3-raise with 8 points and 4333? not for me!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: including 2 jacks|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah i agree, i think 2@s would've been enough|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: must be values|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S prolly gf asking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C other room see if they get there too |pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: 7 of Townsend's 10 points are in perfect place (K@H and A@C)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you bid 3@C in E? a simple 2@S imo.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janhamhurg: so 1 spade denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only beating lead is @s|pg||
nt|jeanhari: cards well placed for EW, will probably make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|iyer7550: yes north will get thrown in all the time. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer considering if it is safe to play an heart|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but will be his most obvious play for the 7th trick|pg||
nt|iyer7550: hearts is the best suit to attack. |pg||
nt|iyer7550: will be a push board. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I said NO!|pg||
nt|yuval10: playing trump as quickly as possible is the key for the def. here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: no pass with hearts (agree unlikely here) or bid 2s with spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far hard work and only a few specks of blood here and there |pg||
nt|april7: after 1@S opening 3@S could have also a good bid asking for a stop in @S, but S wanted to try for more with this hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead 10 of @H?????|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 1 dia shows hearts and 1 heart shows spades|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|lasu: Saariselällä koska hän asuu Vadsössä.|pg||
nt|kippari: kyllä tässä pelattavaa riittää|pg||
nt|odysseus69: doesnt matter a jot here but if West is giving count then I am sure that the right way is to play 2nd highest|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|christinas: I imagine both teams expect to be at the top of the group. 3 vps can turn out quite expensive|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still Denmark heading (51-37?)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 3 rounds|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sweden will be pleased to make game here.  Not so clear on a major-suit lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes not easy maybe Trine could have made a move in bidding|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: Dutch took 7 bids and OR 2 bids to both end in 2@S:)|pg||
nt|christinas: Funny that it took 4 rounds of bidding to reach 2@s. At many tables it will probably go 1@c - 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|skollie: meanwhile NS can't make anything with 25 HCP between them - they can't even bid|pg||
nt|christinas: NS has 25 hcp combined and still cannot make anything of significance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you seem to agree with us Christina:)|pg||
nt|christinas: but still a bit surprising that none of the two NS pairs intervened|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: and the x on 1 spade shows SPADES|pg||
nt|copeyj: well done|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: 5NT was last chance for a makable contract, very good decision by Auken|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes good 5@C |pg||

pc|hK|nt|april7: completely missunderstanding|pg||
nt|jillan:  sometims I think there is a hickup, BjÃ¶rn Fallenius is a quick player|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT + 4 is a remarkable score by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|bjurn:  one does not often gain IMPs when getting that many overtricks |pg||
pc|hA|nt|christinas: I type too slowly. I will go put my baby asleep since you take the words out of my mouth anyway:) brb|pg||
nt|jaapfr: x@C|pg||
nt|christinas: Blakset in teh S seat bids rather aggressively - He could have bid 2@c, but too risky if Jansma had a good hand with such a lousy suit|pg||
nt|lesniak: jesli teraz S zagra trefla to cezary jest faworytem do wppadki:(|pg||

nt|andersk: cold slam here  Whit 2 @S I beleve they will bid it|pg||
nt|anthonyf: 5@S now surely|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bagman: South has great cards in this sequence|pg||
mb|6D|nt|anthonyf: 5@C not the right call|pg||
nt|bagman: void, long trumps and a good side suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I like 5@C better, then 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT just made on 4, will be corrected shortly|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is a diamond raise, just ignoring the hearts, i assume - many people would feel obliged to double to get the major into it, but when opps have spades, all the other suits are ...|pg||
nt|athene: ranked equal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good point|pg||
nt|athene: so it's sensible to show the diamond fit|pg||
nt|anthonyf: When West saves, N/S are more in the dark after 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: also for this NS pair, 1@D opener is much less likely to have hearts|pg||
nt|athene: as they open 4-card majors|pg||
mb|6S|nt|andersk: Jason should have bidded 5@H IMO|pg||
nt|bagman: The grand would not be great but makes|pg||
nt|bagman: bidding 5@H might be a bit too much if partner took that seriously|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|anthonyf: the problem with 5@C is there to see|pg||
nt|bagman: the problem for N was that there was onl 5@D, 6@D or some grand slam try left|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: well north is a passed hand - does 5@H really show so much more than 6@D?|pg||

nt|bagman: he could have @HAK|pg||
nt|anthonyf: a routine down four one assumes|pg||
nt|andersk: Why ignore 5@H, you have xxx in @S which you know pard probably dont have, 5 card @D stiff @C and AQ in @H, looks quite like a supermaximum hand|pg||

mb|2S|an| |nt|kippari: nopea 3NT näyttäis olevan korteissa|pg||
nt|yannis3012: lucky 9 tricks here for n-s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the freaky EW hands 5@D-1 a very logic result|pg||
nt|christinas: 5 @d should be a good contract, but both minor suits break disastrously|pg||
nt|skollie: interesting - i expected jansma to overcall 1@h|pg||
nt|skollie: Ron has an interesting problem now|pg||
nt|skollie: bid spades, diamonds or double?|pg||
nt|christinas: I like the 2Nt bid, it takes away space and serves as a good preempt when he is not vulnerable and the opps are. But it could keep them out of the contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D i should think|pg||
nt|christinas: or perhaps even lead them to make it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i doubt 5@D can be made|pg||
nt|skollie: i would think they play 3@c as a good diamond raise here|pg||
nt|skollie: 3@d seems too little|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you must be rite|pg||
nt|skollie: you wouldn't want to miss your spade fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: another misunderstanding,this time by  EW|pg||

nt|yannis3012: a very good stop for spain with 24 hcps|pg||
nt|rado: some might open 1NT with S hand|pg||

nt|jillan:  they are off to a good start, much better than yesterday, but then they partnered England  fniss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: the reason 2@C is dangerous is that North can be presumed to have no major, and if he doesn't have diamond support (ok, he does here) then the one suit he must have is clubs  |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think with 2 nice hearts and a single dia you must bid 4|pg||

mc|13|nt|jaapfr: 12 imps to NS|pg||

nt|spooky: it's 4@H i East not in North :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: Defence must attack @s suit |pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend may try 6@D here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it correct operator?|pg||
nt|bjurn:  in OR NystrÃ¶m (W) opened 1@S |pg||
nt|jillan:  after west opened 1S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|yannis3012: mmm it is makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|yannis3012: +1 :-)|pg||
nt|skollie: i think, with this spade lay-out, 3N could well be making|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6@H instead|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like it will be 500 only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 easy tricks - 1 @d and 2@c to NS|pg||
nt|spooky: I don't see any danger for the declarer here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Makes +1 by pitching @C on Q@S.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: a possible singleton lead against NT???|pg||
nt|april7: not this time!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a good choise from Trine to stop here altho i would be in 5@s on a good day 6:-))))))|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but musp play 3 rounds oc trumps and cannot win @sQ after 2 @d ruffs|pg||
nt|jillan:  yeah, but thenb we wouldn't have this chance for more fun....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: despite colors, some daring souls would preempt as E, and some perhaps open in 3rd seat. This EW is perhaps content just to let foes bid up to 4N:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  although*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kippari: Jos oli Ekren Jussin piti passata,kai vaatimus päällä oli ja P voi korjata @S-peliin|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know how they play 1S response - maybe balanced something or maybe diamonds- Mike can clarify|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no firweworks here to keep the sepcs interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway now 13 imps to Dutch likely  i see no problems in 3nt for declarer|pg||

nt|iyer7550: certainly they will have a hearty laugh. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|copeyj: 3 rounds @S and A@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good for NS that north had his spade stop|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: unless they are proofreaders by trade:)|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: with helpful lie of clubs and 3/3 dim break a lot of tricks even spade finesse on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the bidding in mind he knows now where @SA is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Looked like declarer had 10 tricks on board 5 (4@DX). Anyone know what happened?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and will auto finesse @SJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we do not know was 4@DXC or 5@D X-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right, perhaps the contract was 5@DX|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or wrong claim (but unlikely early morning:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please enlighten us?|pg||
nt|christinas: it was vitually impossible to go down, I think the contract was 4@d x making.|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|bagman: N did not look for miracle cards but just bashed what he thought he could make|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|andersk: fortunate split here for 12 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Townsend did not sacrifice on board 6, so more IMPs coming Sweden's way in a minute|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11|pg||
nt|athene: red kings for heart pitches, with @S10 as an entry|pg||
nt|bagman: The slam is not so great but happens to make|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|bagman: Might be a play problem with diamond lead and @SJ doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: sorry minor-suit kings :)|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|anthonyf: OK, hopefully meet you soon.|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: will West lead the @CA against 6@S?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|anthonyf: Looks like they are gettin there, a bit better than 50/50|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For newcomers. This match is a replay of yesterday's because the players were sitting in the same direction at the two tables. The match was scored as 12-12 initially but has now ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: been replaced by a replay without penalty. Was convenient because the open teams have the afternoon off|pg||
mb|p|nt|anthonyf: oh dear, not sure what happened |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: surprising view from South - you would think he would drive to six after hearing 3@S|pg||
nt|anthonyf: thanks to a couple of you, 5H asked for third round control of hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: South had too much information (and too little also)|pg||
nt|anthonyf: surely N is worth 5D over 4D|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the auction suffered from too much science - even facing @Hxxx, isn't it really likely you can throw two hearts on minor-suit values with a trump as entry?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: assuming 3@S actually showed something|pg||

nt|yannis3012: now time for a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3c bergen raise? 4 trumps 7-9 hcp|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jameslee 2: bergen support 4 cards @H 7-9 points |pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a dangerous board for England - they can make 5@C N/S if they guess @S (play opening bidder for them)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Double show @C |pg||
nt|psridhar: depends on what that X of 3c means= clubs OR take out of H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: board 5 produced a difference of evaluation....2@D at this table, 5@D at the other |pg||
nt|lesniak: chyba ze ktos zagra 6 karo i trafi pika|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x should be take out for hearts|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here its both:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: it should be as unpassed hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: but as passed hand i play it as lead directional|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so a lot to be discussed !|pg||
nt|iyer7550: bulgaria have averaged out. one non making slam bid and another making slam not bid. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: also @sJx is ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: what to bid from N now?  3@s or 4@s ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rado: 2@S minimum or waiting|pg||
nt|spooky: I would raise to some lvl of @H with the North hand after 1@S, |pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: after splinter S has enough to cue|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not much luck, oh well|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3|pg||

mb|4C|nt|Walddk4: I should really have a remote control for this|pg||
nt|christinas: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Romania OPENED the S hand and reached 5c |pg||
nt|copeyj: can beat 4@H by plenty - 800 potentially|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Funny but it happens:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kippari: 3@H - 1 taitaa olla sitoumus|pg||
nt|yannis3012: i think next bid will be 6 spades...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good Practice is for 4@h to be a high card, not a shortage|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can N bid 5@C? in this secuence |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk 5 clubs is a must if you believe pd!|pg||
nt|psridhar: Gold knows from the auction that hid pd has a stiff or void in h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt 20-21?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rmb1: 1@H artificial strong 20+|pg||
nt|jillan:  what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: when partner promised 5 cards suit yes very good treatment|pg||

mb|p|nt|yannis3012: hmmm they will bid the grand by misunderstanding. unfair because Hk is onside|pg||
nt|odysseus69: eAst should play the 9 on 3rd club|pg||

nt|yuval10: S will bid 6 here|pg||
mb|6S|nt|odysseus69: or 2nd as he has done|pg||
nt|lestergold: another flattish baord no real swing yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stayman would not have been daft with S hand, esp. if N freely opens 1N with 5-card major, but of course pass is normal|pg||
nt|psridhar: so 5c will play well if his pd's X of 3c meant clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: N considered 2nd choise:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: CobyB suggest 10 of trumps lead:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the % play is to finesse the heart - single 3 or 10 twice as likely as single K offside|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: always looks like one off |pg||

mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr: rite score must be 13-20 now|pg||

nt|jillan:  yeah, we need to catch our breath a bit|pg||
nt|yuval10: this 3NT must be played from S, it seem|pg||

nt|yuval10: otherwise @d lead from E is fatal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: whatever - it is safe to say that Spain were a tad fortunate there|pg||
nt|yannis3012: 30 imps diffrence this placement of @hK|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S from townsend probably now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3Nt is playing in te other room by East|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: golds hand is nearly useless playing spades|pg||
nt|jillan:  2@D has anyone got their system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: its just fine, but I have to leave soon!|pg||
nt|psridhar: if played by east it may fetch a spd x lead running to his jack !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bertheau had the chance next door but missed it|pg||

mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: another dull hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: He has plenty if East does not switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|bjurn:  nice lead from Townsend.. making the communication a bit drafty|pg||
nt|fokal: E will have to play @d after the as of @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The play in the other room. Spade to hand, @HQ won by the ace and a spade continuation. Curtains|pg||

nt|lestergold: i cant believe that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lets ask operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c cannot be stayman as such in that case|pg||
nt|spooky: they couldn't pick up spades.. and @DK was onside, so I think this was always making|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you play @d2 from that sequence?  I has played @d10 or @d9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||

nt|Walddk4: It is, but note that Justin did not reveal his clubs in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thus making the defence harder|pg||
nt|fokal: but why did E take the As of @h ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pointed out in the other room, he should have ducked|pg||
nt|fokal: by ducking u might get intel|pg||
nt|jillan:  a little bit strange play by Fallenius I think, but who am I to judge.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fokal: or if u take it first round, scared that it might the 9th trick; it's to play @d hoping for partner to have AJ3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: still, as pointed out, on a diamond lead it's a 5-or-7 hand, so perhaps they are right to play in 7|pg||

nt|ralfwil: sry Fallenius - started with Björn and after that ....|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh well given thear lead straight back|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did not expect 3@S bid:|pg||
nt|christinas: I am suprised Jansma doesn't D with 15 hcp, but perhaps he is afraid of missing 4 of a major because of the vulnerability |pg||
nt|christinas: no, he is very lucky to catch his partner with 4 card support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not when E bids 4@S now|pg||
nt|iyer7550: push board. |pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: pusillanimolus what does he think his opartner is bidding on at unfave vul?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  A good lead from Trine here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might make nine tricks but ten looks too many|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But at these colours save costly.|pg||
nt|spooky: Declarer will lose 2@D and a @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder why not 2@h in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: E doesn't give up, can be costly here|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S lead his singelton , then score 2 ruffs along with 2@h and a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a rise to 4@s on W I think Fredin will Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: im pretty sure gold doubled not townsend|pg||
nt|bjurn:  W might raise to 4|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he should know that his P has only 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: after all, he'd have supported him right away, isn't he?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes. but a short @h|pg||
nt|jillan:  and I thought this was the time to get a cuo pf Jilly coffe|pg||
nt|bjurn:  he's got a good @S suit and picturing p with @SHxx @Hx will make game interesting|pg||
nt|bjurn:  at least vul|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: That is the std bid having 3@H with a J, |pg||
mb|p|nt|yannis3012: 3nt is makeable only with a spade lead|pg||
nt|christinas: but now Paulissen might raise him. It should show something like 5-5 with good siuts in my book - and you can only count the stiff @d Q once|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: even on trump lead, 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with these values.|pg||
nt|yuval10: even so the game will depends on a defensive mistake, and i wouldn't have want to bid such games against a good pair like NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: -1 with a correct defence|pg||
nt|bjurn:  to defeat 4@D NS need to play @Cs before letting decl in|pg||
nt|yuval10: N needs to find @c switch|pg||
nt|jillan:  I like 4D, if P has four @S he will bid 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: usual defence to multi is to double to show oprning bid values and east hand seems adequate|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a veryyyyyyminor chance to make 4@S|pg||
nt|christinas: I am told that 2@s promises 4 @s, otherwise they bid 2@d - but then Paulissen should not raise, since the @d K could be useless - as it is here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yannis3012: next @cJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  u never know:) once i made 6@c with @c QJxxx and an ace out ogt the @c J lead:)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: For me is 3@h on N possible with @sK and a 7-card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but after 2NT, 4@H looks better:)|pg||
nt|spooky: Think they will both take the blame for this.. (in open)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: more like counting tricks than points|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I think E will play on @c, so let us see|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks sensible... @d's can only produce the 9th trick|pg||
nt|bjurn:  NS might get to him if Peter shifts to a @D after @SK|pg||
nt|yuval10: so as specs suggest, likely to go down 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|christinas: surprised N didn't D instead of just bidding 2@s with only 4, but perhaps they have an agreement about that|pg||
nt|copeyj: south can't bid 5@H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec the dia void would make it a 100%|pg||

nt|jeanhari: strange choice, 6NT|pg||

pc|s4|nt|yannis3012: maybe the diamond fit was not guaranteed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but an agressive bid by south!|pg||
nt|iyer7550: unbelieveable choice. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: oh no... needs the club entry for the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so cant geiv up a diamond then|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rmb1: and danger of lack of aces in 6@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  the pas from Trine is dangerous here :):) |pg||
nt|iyer7550: 6nt is very doubtful contract. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so one room bidding and making 7, other down down in 6... most of the time it is the other way around :)|pg||
nt|spooky: ah, sorry It's early and hot for me, declarer will play on a cross ruff otherwise he only has 8 tricks|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 1 imps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jeanhari: north mut find some good discards|pg||
nt|iyer7550: but east was really unreasonable to bid 6nt as a final contract. |pg||
nt|iyer7550: unless he picked on the wrong bidding card. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: norrth must throw 2 clubs, not easy|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only few imps at stake, players don't know that|pg||
nt|iyer7550: this is really going to be a test for north. and spectators are going to have a great chance to clap when north chooses to discard the right cards|pg||

nt|jeanhari: so good pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s looks best, now N will deny control on the minors and 4@h will be the final contract|pg||

nt|psridhar: a preemptive splinter so to say|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 4 clubs sows 44 majors you can nearly cout the rest by playing dia first and have a better chance to make|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes but you dont know if east started 4@D1@c or 3@D2@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: true, but the chances are better for finessing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Director decision will make a 26 Imp,s diference |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think we all know that 4 club shows a hand that can play in both suits!|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is a question of guessing which hand E bid 4c on (1) 1098X,XXXX,XXX,QX or (2) 1098X,XXXX,XXXX,X -the second looks more likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: very tough bidding....N has a minor cue, 5@h and 4@s available....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: this can hardly be described as simple|pg||
nt|yuval10: if we take it that 3@s is shortness, than 4@s is the best bid he has, showing no waisted values there|pg||
nt|yuval10: strongest, not best|pg||

nt|lestergold: ruffing club finesse Victor dim away??|pg||
nt|odysseus69: oh- i missed that club jack|pg||
nt|lestergold: only line available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good heavens what a trik|pg||
nt|odysseus69: anyway West should have led a trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4N surely showed 3 clubs, so jack is not expendable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its not expendable under any circumstances|pg||
nt|petere: 2@S Muyderberg (6-11, 5@S + 4 other)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H depends on the @D guess |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts depends on early switch to dia|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@H in this case a good safe, but not clear to west if 4! makes and not much to gain|pg||
nt|iyer7550: when you are forced to make a choice of bid at 4 level and do bid. and when the dummy comes down you see a 4 card support wont it be like a candy for a crying baby|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: passed hand, but still--|pg||
nt|psridhar: W only passed 1C, and can hv a good hand with clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: T98XXX XX ATX AX might just be possible but agree odds on|pg||

nt|lestergold: pigotm will need a very long neck to get this right|pg||

nt|jaapfr: just in time for yr X partscore:)|pg||
nt|athene: as he would be throwing a diamond from dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: just more than he has|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|anthonyf: once W has S!AK, the diamond guess is gone|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|anthonyf: needs to play @S 10 now|pg||
nt|anthonyf: or a heart followed by a spade ducked|pg||
nt|bagman: After that the defense is easy becaus with a read ace S has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: red ace|pg||
nt|athene: well, the defence don't know that declarer has seven clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: sometimes E has AJ8 in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt opener might be quite bent in fourth chair|pg||
nt|anthonyf: Might try a flashy @D9|pg||

nt|anthonyf: why|pg||
nt|bagman: he got 2 diamonds now|pg||
nt|athene: @S8 just discouraged i think|pg||
nt|athene: west obviously worried that his partner had only two spades so no point leading small spade|pg||
nt|bagman: From West's view there were two lines of defense: set spades or take 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|athene: he wanted to use his @SAK as entries to lead through dummy's diamonds|pg||
nt|anthonyf: thanks to everyone, time to watch some cricket!!  All the best|pg||
nt|athene: count signal in spades would have worked better |pg||

nt|iyer7550: wow bulgaria has gained again on this innocuous contract. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  interesting board, sooo busy trying to figure out ALL the possible contracts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6@s and 6@c wins here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well irish over reached themselves in the open room here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can hardly blame X of 4@H by N here|pg||
nt|jillan:  IF you drop the SK that is|pg||

nt|ralfwil: next board looks not so good for the swedes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  Â¨AND 7C IF you dop not drop the SK  :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: 3NT + 1 seem like a great result for England|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@d switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes the lead was the @SA and a @D return|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S must have promoted to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: so england could more or less equalise on this board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a VERY strong 3@H imo|pg||
nt|copeyj: mamma papa 3NT here|pg||
nt|copeyj: not so exciting|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 4NT a good 5@c bid here?|pg||
nt|jillan:  6C should not make with the right defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: This sort of bid came up in Bridge Magazine bidding competition this month|pg||

pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: S holding a bit in reserve there i would say, after the free 1S|pg||

nt|spooky: I would open 3@D with the North hand tho..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
nt|jillan:  no that us the 9th trick|pg||
nt|kerasidis: small spade now?|pg||
nt|jillan:  not thateasy maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the problem for W is that he feard 9 tricks from the top|pg||
nt|ralfwil: fears..|pg||
nt|kerasidis: in order to go down east need surely one spade|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes and if P has 2@S and the AJ of @D|pg||
nt|yuval10: e can't be sure that S doesn't have 8 @c's , for instance|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, west needs to know how many spades his partner has|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes but that A asks for what?|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't learn that in either room|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: 1nt - 18-20|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4 imps in this contract|pg||
nt|copeyj: England stopped in 3@C next door on 15, so likely 7 or so imps to Romania|pg||
nt|rmb1: Reasonable to reach 6@C after the preemptive auction|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Trine must be asking for a diffrent lead a red suit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and my bet is east will lead a @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but im aaaalwaaays wrong:)|pg||
nt|jillan:  I had this problem at a Wotld Championship ON rama. showed the D2 and the H2 to the camera -|pg||
pc|s4|nt|christinas: I would also bid 4@h, but I understand if some only bid 3 vulnerable, it depends on style|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope tonite the Dutch more lucky than the Danish:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: between 20-30 and  22.15 hrs i mean:)|pg||

nt|petere: NS 7 quick tricks, EW 4 ...|pg||

nt|iyer7550: 9 tricks are no prob for declarer. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: 11 or 12 imps for NS here|pg||
nt|antoniz: ufff|pg||
nt|petere: it depends on finding the @SQ (as @Cs give the 8th trick)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janhamhurg: a lot of imps swinging around !|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer tempted to finesse something in case she can bring in the suit, but when West is void she should play low|pg||

nt|lesniak: +13 impow zapisuje na konto Balickiego|pg||
nt|psridhar: Italy leading by 10 imp vs Norway; sweden by 19 vs ducth|pg||

nt|spooky: 2 imps to Russia|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: lets see what South decide |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but south has extras|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i would bid 6 with the south hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has to see that he needs SPd Q, H ace, dia ACE, and KQ of club from Gold, unlikely he will bid 4s with those|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think that north shows about that with his 3 bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South takes his time |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we have more than 20 min for 2 boards---|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yes most exciting aftyer a slow start|pg||
nt|eamongall: the tennis guys are 2 sets all and 44-44 in the fifth |pg||
nt|eamongall: and 8 hours |pg||
nt|jaapfr: congratulations to the Danish team with their win here (good revanche for the 0-1 with soccer:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: both teams played very good bridge, England were a tad unlucky|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: & England still close|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no ruling in 12 so far, so result might change in favor of romania!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petere: no idea how many tricks here, but enough anyway :)|pg||
nt|spooky: 2N asking, 3@D min with @D I think..|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough choice for N now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rado: 1NT showing @S probably and 3@C check back 3@S by N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and victor joined us very early too. eamon must have dropped in from another match, but it has been quite a spectacle|pg||
nt|Walddk12: 1NT was 14-16 in the other room I believe|pg||

nt|lasu: sama sitoumus avoimessa|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Marshall for ur excellent workc im sure will see more of each other this coming week!|pg||
nt|andersk: 11 IMP victory for sweeden, thats 17-13 in VP|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ryskiel_: yesterday s result was a little other 54-27 but for England|pg||
nt|jillan:  So England got one more, but I guess they would have prefered 12-12 now :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: as about 2000 out of the 2200 specs suggested, 2@s was actually @s + @c, 9-13, which makes N's lead a lot more obvious|pg||
nt|jillan:  Ryskiel, yesterday they had the Swedes as tem mates so of course they won :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lasu: meillä on vielä ratkaiseva jako jäljellä jako 1|pg||

nt|Walddk12: What was 3@S all about I wonder|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: and if u are still here Victor thx!|pg||
nt|rmb1: The next match starts at 16:15 in Belgium, 14:15 GMT in 35 minutes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe she did not like a @s lead and chose to bid them for a diffrent lead|pg||
nt|jillan:  thanks all. this should get some imps to Sweden, BUT not enough|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Cilla avoided the diamond lead here, so this looks too tough for Nadia|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|vugraphznm: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes sorry u are!|pg||
nt|petere: @S, @H and @D will cost a trick (or will make is more easy)|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS violated Burns law and W balanced them out :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: north can cash his tricks and wait for trumps|pg||
nt|jillan:  and the loosers had English team mates  LOL|pg||

nt|yuval10: i really hope thos VP's that been given as a gift to England and Sweden won't play any factor in this championship|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|iyer7550: the turning point was the grand slam on a finesse bid by bulgaria while croatia were in a pathetic contrat to go down|pg||
nt|iyer7550: that deal costed 17 imps. |pg||
nt|iyer7550: croatia lost the match by 16 imps. |pg||
