nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running scores|pg||
nt|haans: TG CC say Flannery :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
nt|gohar: they deserve penality|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
nt|hedyg: went down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1 sek brb|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To bid ANYTHING with the West-hand is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just ducked the @c and let E ruff and make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H seems to be makeable and that is 620, lets see|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 4@h should have been won|pg||
nt|hedyg: ducking the @c lead he loses 1@c 1ruff and 1@s|pg||
nt|gohar: yes @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: down 3 ...|pg||
nt|gohar: 4@h better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even going up then draw 2@d 2@h ruff a @d and 10 trick's|pg||
pc|dK|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
nt|gohar: what abt the other table?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||

nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||

pc|s7|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
nt|gohar: irrespective of any lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @D-loser|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||

nt|vbman: ---------------4-------------------|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again a tricky hand NS with combined 25 hcp may end up in 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: in my cristal l see several down in 3 nt|pg||
nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 6@c depends on guessing who has the doubleton @h A (or singleton)|pg||
nt|benjy:  you are completely scuppered|pg||
nt|mamos: Anyway passed of safely|pg||
nt|hedyg: he played K@H on the switch!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S A-K useless|pg||
mb|2N|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||
nt|hedyg: why useless? good for 7NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now 4@s|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c rkc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
mb|6D|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hat to tell you, but 7 @S is ONLY 2.000 = gaining 5 IMP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Doubled -|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter now:(|pg||
nt|hawe45:   I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think he should have bid 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know theyre system but must be void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tuff start at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H he can claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d showed a 4card mixed raise according to their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: no has to check @ds first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me east does not have a 3@d bid but it is much closer than the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll is going somewhere about three off so someone seems to have done tooo much|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: frankly this is rooutine defence for top class players but in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||

nt|copeyj: N opened 2@S (8-11)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: but the vulnerability persuaded tosh to try game|pg||
nt|lestergold: stout lads who is Marshall talking about cant be us Simon|pg||

nt|andreasw:  wow!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  given the result at the other table it cost only 1 imp to bid the game as opposed to stoppint liw|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
nt|mamos: three off turned out  to be optimistic|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w may well end up in 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: Cristina Giampietro and Pony Nehmert bid 1@s 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland said that is not a record|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT natural with 4+ @d I believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andreasw:  Italy'en team is *powning*:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be -1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: partscores are not IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
nt|mamos: id expect South to bid 2@h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||

nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  Assuming the change is minor and published to the other countries|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer slipped up a little|pg||
nt|copeyj: and townsend made him pay|pg||
nt|copeyj: excellent defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done tom u just saved 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: althouh i don't see why it was necessary to play spades at that point|pg||
nt|copeyj: well it wasn't nice to see an error|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  this would be a minor change, it's just all the photocopying for the NPC or coach that is the hassle|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Flannery has changed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a fair overcall tho|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: wrong play:) but we have seen all the cards.:)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|copeyj: I would pass 3@C with the N hand i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: assuming this is weak jump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H equally good.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what is wrong with 6@C, EW.|pg||
nt|benjy:  impossible in my view|pg||
nt|eweber: I have been told these sites work best with Internet Exlorer, some browsers refuse to show anything when you click on "playing record"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||

nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: true :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|copeyj: and play 4@H|pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes a great lead |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 5 card stayman, so 2@D showed 1+ 4cM, 2@S showed @H and no @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: is my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||
nt|copeyj: they both are|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||
nt|jfaria: now easy ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps wanted another club for a double?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: nicely avoided @d lead|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ive been looking at scores instead of bridge :(    sorry|pg||

nt|pitiful:  strong @c by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: no finesse in OR|pg||
nt|haans: more than 50% |pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodvenn: tounrament director, and make them go thru the boards one by one. |pg||
nt|andersk: jeez....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in the end they accepted that it was a draw|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand:)|pg||
nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N is roughly 21-22 for Gold/Townsend (1@C opener can include balanced 20)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c big there, m i alone ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just borrowed one HCP|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gromov spicing things up a bit with a delayed 3N overcall here :)|pg||

nt|haans: imps at right side?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||
nt|copeyj: although perhaps the operator misscored the last board - looks like 11 tricks only?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i dont want a @c lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||
nt|haans: then you are in 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: acceptance from W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guys - today is a "short" day - 1 or 2 matches only|pg||

nt|hedyg: could be weak, like 9-10 hcps|pg||

nt|hawe45:  2 NT will go down, South has NO reason to guess the @S-position|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vbman: so its 5 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: back to partscores|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Lose only 2 Aces as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Gold is playing 2@h as a good weak two and 2@d multi as a weak weak two in third seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: 2@c is stayman with the intention of follow up with 2! which is invitational|pg||
nt|christinas: @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: well flat thankfully for england dont think they can afford any more adverse swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s is not a great contract tho especially non vul-|pg||
nt|lestergold: neeeds 2 out of three fimnesses and a 2/1 spade break more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: the problem is if dummy is forced |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  after so many " @s " bids, will W lead this suit?|pg||
nt|mamos: it's amazing how little help so many CCs are|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7, 5@C -1, @S wrong guess.|pg||
nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria: fiendly lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has pros and cons i admit.... passing or bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H = transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: not much point in ducking here|pg||
nt|xenya: so two boards now seem to have been misscored: 2 and 8  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: agree Mike, pass to 1@s sound|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will North lead 4th best @S...?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: makes the work easy.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace and @D to the 10|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hans he cannot see the cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  No - but he needs 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he can try:p|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 26 of them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: west probably backs in if u pass but unlikely they have a game and more likely u get into trouble bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|shevek: not much point in winning either :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why in @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds and 1@h is enough|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: 11 toptricks - time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Sweden :)|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally and Nicola have won 12 Imps by pushing Cristina and Pony to 5 in board 6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andersk: -1, good result for NS here! As the layout is, 3 NT makes EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense another @C|pg||
nt|haans: no guess at or|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: thsi room|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Please tell how 2@H made 9 tricks on board 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i agree its controversial but here you have a misfit and the heart suit and a k makes it unlikely not impossible that oppos have a game|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Down 1 much more likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no sorry|pg||
nt|jallerton: North did well to make it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)or 1@d and 2@h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  By taking the @cÂ´s he will get discard-problems himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he has killed communications|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: trash may end you in 4-3 instead of 5-3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  That was why I recommended to play at least a RED suit from dummy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: the point has been mentioned|pg||

nt|haans: ,|pg||

pc|cA|nt|haans: now can geuss wrong in @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NL has 130VPs as compared to Sweden's 110, so far.|pg||

nt|haans: small to A one way|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: ohhhh not @d to the 10?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Specs have pointed out that Sweden has more Vps then I mentioned, may the record available with me has not been updated.:)|pg||

nt|henryb:  Jansma's most successful action would have been the "green" card|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  I wonder how they got the 12th trick|pg||
nt|pelu: no beer for me to day - to morrow morning I am going by car to Oostende :(|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H showed 6@S minimum or 16+ with @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: when he continued with 3@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a good beginning is half a succession|pg||
nt|copeyj: he showed 5-3-1-4 and a good hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm the hackett vulnerable barrage on the ew/ cards in the open room does not look very sound lucky only one off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nine toppers|pg||
nt|haans: we take that as it comes|pg||
nt|jfaria: 1nt must be like std now|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  nice dummy here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: We have a very generous operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean neither of their buids would have been my choice|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose has some other way of showing 5-3-4-1 good hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the classical Multi opening, although this time it worked well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||

nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
nt|eweber: if I remember correctly and they still play like this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|jallerton: has to run this, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: IMPs right i assume|pg||
nt|paulg:  as happened to Scotland's women in the previous match, bidding a thin grand slam when the opposition are only in game is not a winning formula|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: ot is double unlucky|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|andersk: as I predicted|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Sorry-connection problem.|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|1C|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  Kxx in E hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so is my grade in german:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||

nt|haans: not|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||

nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Dear collegue - 4 @H lay-down = 10 tricks, they will regret, that they didÂ´nr RD|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1130 against possible 1370|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oh-oh - only 600...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So "WE" get 11 IMP|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||

pc|sT|nt|hedyg: so much for laydown|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||

pc|c8|nt|haans: he does not 50% of time 2|pg||
nt|haans: is it time ti think now?|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, he might play clubs from the top, then try for some endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: very obscure, all that|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 11 Cullin bid 6@d|pg||
nt|xenya: lead?|pg||
nt|shevek: @d|pg||
nt|haans: thats why we are leading am never we if they are losing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible, really Jansma played @d7?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|xenya: so a nice pick-up for Sweden|pg||

nt|xenya: again, the way the play was shown here, the result should be 2 off, not 3 |pg||
nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry for miscounting, 1130 was never in question, but 930 by playing @C earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|eweber: good defense against a making 3@d contract :)|pg||
nt|mamos: must take diamonds now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
nt|mamos: :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 1 convention I realy dont like. thats the 1NT Forcing - dont hear me, if u like that convention :):)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  Dubinin really taking this long?  unusual for him.|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: better this match then first no score at all then|pg||
nt|shevek: hahaha they made 6@h on both sides!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: u dont have to look for running scores - all tre group are off-line - hard to start a big tournament as this - over 60 teams - and more from saturday (Senior !!!)|pg||

nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||

nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||
nt|paulg:  is this layout almost pre-destined?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: probably|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: do not balance in long in their suit = p have no points|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: now!!|pg||
nt|jallerton: well I suppose if anyone has an 8-card spade fit it's probably oppo|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: a lot off|pg||

nt|toniemme: analogamente con terza nell'altro nobile (ma Didi è stato spinto dalla zona favorevole) non è proprio così obbligatorio licitare 2@H...(in compenso le @S sono scartinate e questo ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: Didi lo ha valutato)..non ultimo a volte questi interventi limitano la licita avversaria alzando violentemente il livello licitativo..|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||

nt|rodvenn: Iceland leads now by a mile|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it all depends to pin stiff s K|pg||

nt|hedyg: time and expertise to guide us through these boards.our appreciation to the EBL and the BBF for bringing this event to BBO, especially Guy Lambeaux  who was intrumental in ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow at 10 30 local time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: I have seen that the match in Women: Israel - Libanon didnt start - we had that problem 10 years ago - but I hoped that sport now overruled politic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold slam|pg||
nt|jfaria: OK a good strugle now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have saved a trick drawing a trump at the end|pg||
nt|ady: grand here|pg||
nt|ady: but on heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sweden are recovering at a pace that could lead to a win|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||
nt|mamos: not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mamos: shed have preferred oppo to open 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland in it therefore|pg||
nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||
nt|vasmar: not yet :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: mariani maschera la Dama..|pg||
nt|rialc2: Carlo nasconde la Q di @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx to all has been great  and thx to our operater Thierry for doing a great Job bye everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Andi :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||
nt|toniemme: now low club for not easy defense..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will not find it|pg||
nt|toniemme: 4@C 4@S 1ruf and 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: count to 10 and play small @c|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  also his redouble on the first board was not a roaring success|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sfoxa:  that promotes 3rd trump trick for defence|pg||

nt|vasmar: no need for 5 since there is a discard|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|toniemme: nice play from south..10@S very important card..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had a chance ruffing 1@H with K@s and playing @s to squeeze N before playing @c|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D would squeeze E.|pg||
