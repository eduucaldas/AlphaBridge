nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Simon late... go stand in corner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H two-suiter???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome simon|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 7-10(11) 5], not 4[|pg||
nt|xenya: unless something very unusual happened |pg||
nt|shevek: 5@h not 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very lucky diamonds for the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: i had duties getting cereal bars for a certain D Gold|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative lead by Fredin -- maybe now it's makeable? |pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||

nt|h_karluk: however still makes 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||

nt|xenya: 2 i meant|pg||
nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||

pc|d5|nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||

pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||

pc|hK|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
pc|h6|nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||

nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||

nt|brgpro: Maarten, I think you are still the tallest bridge player of the world, right?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D!|nt|brgpro: so you can see farer and clearer than us|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|brgpro: maybe young players but NOT Chinese!|pg||
nt|skollie: ew will reach 4@h (or maybe 4@s)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h looks reasonable|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|skollie: how what would we choose with W now?|pg||
nt|skollie: 4@d should be showing 6-3, i think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@s looks easier than 4@h|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|brgpro: @c are 5-2|pg||
nt|milton_se: making 5 in Hs, only 4 in Ss|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h is easier i am afraid|pg||
nt|brgpro: might even go down in 4@s|pg||
nt|skollie: interesting contract to play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In 4@s you don´t need any ruffs on dummy and can set up your @h|pg||
nt|milton_se: even Fredin may hace som problems here|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, he needs to be careful to make this|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|skollie: now he will have to guess what's going on|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he needs to play @h to the Q and when N plays a small @h back he has to decide|pg||
nt|milton_se: can't do that |pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N ducks @hQ 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: finesse @hJ or play @c 4-3|pg||
nt|skollie: he may get it right|pg||
nt|skollie: he knows N has no singleton|pg||
nt|skollie: so 5@d|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|milton_se: he should have played QH b4 the C ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|skollie: and S wouldnt bid 3@d with 3244, maybe?|pg||
nt|brgpro: now small @h will put him to guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|skollie: good defense|pg||
nt|milton_se: y -- guess he plays for Cs 4-3|pg||
nt|brgpro: i just text messaged Driver|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Peter will do this right. Without @hJ he had no hurry!|pg||
nt|brgpro: time for the truth...|pg||
nt|skollie: he could get it right - not easy|pg||

nt|ady: this is a possible slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty gl there|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|copeyj: 12 tricks in NT on non @D lead - and on a @D lead you will have to guess whether to play T or Q if played by South (solid played by N)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: what happened is beyond me:) |pg||
nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u arent playing because ur needed as a coach|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: 4-cards|pg||
nt|shevek: always unbalanced|pg||
nt|haans: make it harder to find @D|pg||
nt|copeyj: this might have been a good board for england in the closed room|pg||
nt|copeyj: N opened 2@S (8-11)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: but the vulnerability persuaded tosh to try game|pg||
nt|lestergold: stout lads who is Marshall talking about cant be us Simon|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: partscores are not IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|copeyj: declarer slipped up a little|pg||
nt|copeyj: and townsend made him pay|pg||
nt|copeyj: excellent defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done tom u just saved 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: more?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: althouh i don't see why it was necessary to play spades at that point|pg||

nt|rnmalik: wrong play:) but we have seen all the cards.:)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|skollie: 2@h by N? or wouldn't that be natural?|pg||
nt|skollie: i would hate not being able to bid that suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: very hard for W to find @hA lead, so 6@D is only 3 down|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy for EW -- 1C can be a doubleton in a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|skollie: Brink will not let them play 6@c now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|skollie: will S be looking for 3NT? or just bid 5@d directly?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brgpro: interesting decision for EW if S jumps to 5@d now|pg||
nt|skollie: 5@c by Fredin now - maybe he will bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: now W has a chance to bid 5@c...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|skollie: he expects 6@c to make and/or NS to save|pg||
nt|skollie: good bid 6@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: Brink will not allow this....we hope|pg||
nt|ralfwil: funny, but only a small @d from S and a @c ruff can beat 6@s:)|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|brgpro: 2@s=limit or better in @c|pg||
nt|skollie: 2@s is a club 'raise' (1@c shows only 2)|pg||
nt|skollie: 3@h-4@c|pg||
nt|skollie: and N will raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: 5@c on a @s guess|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brgpro: now S promises @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@d or more easy 5@c from N now in my opinion|pg||
nt|brgpro: and after 3@s, N will never stop below game|pg||
nt|skollie: now 3NT in N will not make...but i think N won't bid that|pg||
nt|brgpro: S can try to ruff some @d to find out |pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe he will then guess right|pg||
nt|skollie: it's close : Qxx QJxx KJxx xx maybe also just a 3@h bid|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|d|nt|brgpro: 4@d=RKC i think|pg||
nt|brgpro: Maarten, the hand u said might be worth 2NT, i am not sure|pg||
nt|skollie: i think just cuebid|pg||
nt|skollie: yes, i think it's close to 2NT/3@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: a good 3@h raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: so, after ruffing some @D shd help a lot|pg||
nt|skollie: so brink has this clue|pg||
nt|skollie: and we think he will make 5@c - but he won't make 6@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|skollie: so they need to stop|pg||
nt|brgpro: they wont be in 6...|pg||
nt|skollie: i think 3@s was a bit aggresssive|pg||
nt|brgpro: non of them can push that hard with the cards they have|pg||
nt|milton_se: hasn't Bas already bid the full value of his hand?|pg||
nt|brgpro: even S bids 4NT now ( rkc i hope...) N will bid 5@c, then ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|skollie: i'm not sure - i think 4@s S and 5@c n|pg||
nt|skollie: N is unlimited so S can't bid 5@c now|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont know how they treat 3@s bid...help suit game try...or shape...or values?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|skollie: he can and does|pg||
nt|brgpro: or just bid for fun?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|brgpro: 5-4 for sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or  @s9x|pg||

nt|h_karluk: carbon copy auctions are very rare|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
pc|c2|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: 6@d has a double dummy solution|pg||
nt|copeyj: two imps to Russia here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||

nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||

nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||

nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and how can W pass in CR?|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: beyond my imagination|pg||
nt|brgpro: because his pd opened 1@c, he didnt know his @d were covered|pg||
nt|skollie: closed room: strong 1@c and west doubled (not sure if it shows or denies values)|pg||
nt|skollie: and Muller figured he would set 4@s, while bidding 5@d was to much of a guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|skollie: now if Brink would double, would that be Lightner?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: the X will clear out the @d position|pg||

nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||

nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
