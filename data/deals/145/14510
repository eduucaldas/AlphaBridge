nt|mareczek: ostatnie s³owo do Bala|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead could have been the ace of @C and a look at the signal and then......|pg||

mb|p|nt|lasu: tämä me jo nähtiin|pg||
nt|lesniak: -|pg||
nt|lesniak: ostatnie slowo nalezalo do Cezarego - trudno sie dziwic ze nie powiedzial 5 pik|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or even at green, as Zia did in the American Trials yesterday|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he went for 500 against 430, so only a small loss|pg||
nt|skollie: N will lead @dQ and 11 tricks will be made|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W  a negative double |pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: desperate effort to promote trump trick for defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: towsend rock minimum for his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this can make double dummy on this lead but i fear iy wont make in practice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it will|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here unluckily it is wrong sided - 4nt not safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E will not enjoy discarding twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can safely discard clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if declarer plays 2 top diamonds it is over|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is that an abovious line|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when q@d drops does that deny the J!?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he discards clubs declarer's task is easy as little temptation to try club hook|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but there is restricted choice, plus some possibility that with diamonds that good he might have led one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he cashes his hearts East will be forced to make at leas 1 club discard and declarer will guess to play on diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possibe Victor but he has to play well if he is to makem this|pg||
nt|april7: a small swing for Germany  by making 3 @C losing only 1 trick in every suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H by E|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: 4@S by W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 4@H by E:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good lead 2@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how can south bid 2 dia, you know simon?|pg||
nt|copeyj: because they play 4 card suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when they have 4cM and weak NT they open 1M|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 1@D is often 5 for them|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so that promisses 3+ with an honour?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: i dont think it "promises" that|pg||
nt|copeyj: i mean he was non vul|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: and just trying to be awkward for the opps|pg||
nt|copeyj: but yes if you like :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok so just a 3 card raise- thx|pg||
nt|copeyj: he wants partner to lead @D if partner on lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a few values|pg||
nt|copeyj: this looks like down 1 in any case|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i meant with promising an honour:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: it just seems normal to run hearts then play 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there is a late discard coming in spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania credited with 10 tricks here on board 2 - but looks unlikely because they claimed at T1 and there were only 9 then|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so ns must keep playing dia |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: no spade lead in the open room|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lasu: näyttäs kotipeliltä jos vetää hertta maskin|pg||
nt|copeyj: note the @DJ at T1 from Gold|pg||
nt|copeyj: tells his partner exactly what was going on in that suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: if LHO does have QJx of diamonds there is still the spade king onside possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see this failing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but then i dont see my own failings either:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes since WEst has at least 8 major cards playing diamonds looks natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can we call that a profesional play simon?|pg||

nt|copeyj: he knows townsend has either K or Q of @H|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: so whichever it is|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can beat the contract by playing K@D and another @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be the queen of dia wasnt the right card earlier|pg||
nt|copeyj: although i suppose if townsend had dry Q@H left declarer could ruff high and then crash the @H honours|pg||
nt|copeyj: so maybe that is not true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he must be thinking all his posibilitys |pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: operator? what happened? another dia?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it heralds a long match when you hold 31 HCP including all aces and three kings and you have to sweat to make 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: they claimed-? not possible he claimed 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: double is pass or convert|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@s waiting and EW will play in 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I now hear that an appeal brought back 2 VPs to both teams, so they only lost 3 each|pg||
nt|april7: an impossible 5 @D contract to make,because of no access to dummy for @H finesse, except EW leads @H sometime|pg||
nt|april7: 4 or 5 @D now!!!|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 5@C other room see if they get there too |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 7 of Townsend's 10 points are in perfect place (K@H and A@C)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janhamhurg: so 1 spade denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no pass with hearts (agree unlikely here) or bid 2s with spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far hard work and only a few specks of blood here and there |pg||
nt|april7: after 1@S opening 3@S could have also a good bid asking for a stop in @S, but S wanted to try for more with this hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead 10 of @H?????|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 1 dia shows hearts and 1 heart shows spades|pg||

nt|odysseus69: doesnt matter a jot here but if West is giving count then I am sure that the right way is to play 2nd highest|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: I imagine both teams expect to be at the top of the group. 3 vps can turn out quite expensive|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still Denmark heading (51-37?)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 3 rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: Dutch took 7 bids and OR 2 bids to both end in 2@S:)|pg||
nt|christinas: Funny that it took 4 rounds of bidding to reach 2@s. At many tables it will probably go 1@c - 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|skollie: meanwhile NS can't make anything with 25 HCP between them - they can't even bid|pg||
nt|christinas: NS has 25 hcp combined and still cannot make anything of significance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you seem to agree with us Christina:)|pg||
nt|christinas: but still a bit surprising that none of the two NS pairs intervened|pg||

nt|jaapfr: with the freaky EW hands 5@D-1 a very logic result|pg||
nt|christinas: 5 @d should be a good contract, but both minor suits break disastrously|pg||
nt|skollie: interesting - i expected jansma to overcall 1@h|pg||
nt|skollie: Ron has an interesting problem now|pg||
nt|skollie: bid spades, diamonds or double?|pg||
nt|christinas: I like the 2Nt bid, it takes away space and serves as a good preempt when he is not vulnerable and the opps are. But it could keep them out of the contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D i should think|pg||
nt|christinas: or perhaps even lead them to make it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i doubt 5@D can be made|pg||
nt|skollie: i would think they play 3@c as a good diamond raise here|pg||
nt|skollie: 3@d seems too little|pg||

nt|jaapfr: in 5@D i fear not able to trump @C enough|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the reason 2@C is dangerous is that North can be presumed to have no major, and if he doesn't have diamond support (ok, he does here) then the one suit he must have is clubs  |pg||

mb|5H|nt|mamos: I think North will choose 5@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north can either soube or bid 5@h oh sndvquist has overestimated the defensive potential of his hand here|pg||
nt|athene: east doubles on the basis that eleven tricks is a lot to ask when you don't have any side-suit source of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: also he hopes to persuade the defence to go wrong if there is a trump guess perhaps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: although that reminds me of a similar double leon yallouze made with garozzo many years ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes unfortunately all these hopes will be dashed pdq|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo:- "you can't double with a void in trumps!"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: yallouze: "i wanted to protect your Qxx"|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo "i didn't have Qxx, i had two small"|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but the pass out position in this multi sequence is not a balncing position partner is notguarnanteed to have much omn that type opf auction so a back in must be sound|pg||

nt|vugraphznm: indeed its very dificult to see all the  cards and put them in thx for understanding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: would you think about slam?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: N could do  a splinter 4@D |pg||
nt|psridhar: if S held spd queen instead of dia Jack in the same hand, slam is on a finesse thru the opener|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Gold will be worried abt a club lead thru his KJXX|pg||

nt|jaapfr: both N brave 2@S bids:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: surprised N didn't D instead of just bidding 2@s with only 4, but perhaps they have an agreement about that|pg||
nt|copeyj: south can't bid 5@H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec the dia void would make it a 100%|pg||
nt|copeyj: way too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he cant jumkp and wants to show his shape truth is if partner cvnnot move over a spade are they likely to miss a agame?|pg||

nt|lestergold: how many timnes have u taken a so called marked finesse and its been wrong|pg||
nt|athene: slam here depends on getting the clubs right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: unlikely to do that but also unlikely to bid slam anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: South will be concerned|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids 3nt over a multi on the previous board, he ought to do the same here really :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might try saccing in 4 of partner's major|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks hard here for n/s not to bid a slam somewhere 33 combined points two 5 card suits with fits but to make you have to find an inspired view in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: Sandqvist will bid|pg||
nt|mamos: he does have two tens|pg||
nt|mamos: and more seriously a ten card fit in a major|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has 4 spades and a stiff at fave vul and knows opps are headed for slam|pg||
nt|athene: the only slight question-mark is whether 4@H is pass or correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: id think so|pg||
nt|athene: you might want some way for responder to simply bid his own major to play although it's quite rare|pg||
nt|mamos: D might be safer|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: sand might bid 4N if there is an ambiguity|pg||
nt|athene: east with fourteen hearts and a spade void wants to be able to bid 4@H here and not have partner dutifully correct to spades :)|pg||
nt|athene: he might try something cute with a minor then redoubling|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel could be some blood flow ion this hand in one or mother direction|pg||
nt|athene: the only real answer is to have firm agreements|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: EWs multi is 0-8 so may be thinking about more than 4 Level|pg||
nt|athene: it's common to play 2@D 4@C uncontested as asking partner to transfer into his major|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with 4@c sandqvist happy tio play in 4@c undoubled for example|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they play system on here although it would surprise me :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thisn is a good part of sandqvists game very tricky and disruptive|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: south asks west about his possible hands (5 or 6 card)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think these are players who re happy at these colours in this situation to play by the seat iof their pants|pg||
nt|athene: the interesting thing about 4@C is, it does tell NS that hearts are probably breaking badly|pg||
nt|athene: which might make them a bit more cautious about bidding slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever slam n/s play in they are unlikely to pick up that pesky club Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the long spades marked with west |pg||
nt|athene: well, if north managed to play in 6@H, east might try the club lead|pg||
nt|athene: which would be very bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the north south's coach have warned them about the sanqvist style they will not take too much notice|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt NS can organise for north to declare hearts at this point, even if they could have done over 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: declaring hearts or clubs will not escape the necessity of finding the @c Q|pg||
nt|mamos: and .........    if you are declaring slam you might wonder what East has if it's not shape cos it certainl isnt points|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that matter 6N just as good i.e. bad!|pg||
nt|mamos: as you dont have a two way finesse your choice is between taking the Club finesse or playiing for 2-2 break|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a point but would u like to be in the hot seat in this slam hand?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|mamos: certainly not   -- although wont you be able to get a complete count?|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the first round of clubs you will see the 7 drop on one side and the 9 or ten on the other and it will give you no remote restricted choice position|pg||
nt|mamos: West is known to hold sis spadesa  and has one heart and three diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the specs must be impatient to see the kill point on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i certainly am|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: i think declarer will make 6NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: playing in notrumps, rather than clubs, you can explore the hand and find west has a singleton heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: you think the 4@c bid has given the game away Mike you may be right|pg||
nt|athene: which might perhaps offer a clue as to the club break|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think there is going to be a long tank at the kill point here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|athene: it's still extremely close|pg||
nt|mamos: I think declarer will discover the complete count|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will find that west has 7 major-suit cards and east has 8|pg||
nt|athene: no, he will only find that both players have three diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so west could be 6-1-3-3 or 6-1-4-2|pg||
nt|athene: which are the two critical holdings|pg||
nt|lestergold: well I really do not know what purpose Tosh's double has served except to imply that he has all the outstanding high cards bearing in mind that there are only two of them!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: the one thing east has to do is hang on to those diamonds!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well declarfer is likely to smell a rat of some klnd here|pg||
nt|athene: this is a point people often miss - in defence if you have something like three or four small in a suit, you often have to keep them so declarer can't get a count, or guess your ...|pg||
nt|athene: partner has the queen in the suit|pg||
nt|athene: one thing you might perhaps consider is that east is more likely to sac over 3nt with a singleton club than with @CQx|pg||
nt|athene: but really there isn't so much to go on, i don't think|pg||

nt|lestergold: and i win the commentators curse com,petition on this hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: please send prioze money immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: would west open with only 5 points?|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: north calls director|pg||
nt|athene: there were lots of small indications but nothing really conclusive |pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours as i said you look pretty silly when you take a nonsense bid seriously which Sandqvist was quite capable of producing|pg||
nt|athene: he was playing west for @SAxxxxx @Hx @DJ10xx @C109 which might be a reasonable double|pg||
nt|lestergold: at the end of the day the odds were probably not to play west as starting with 3 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done Tosh for the club switch|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being west thinks he has an unexpected diamond trick|pg||
nt|mamos: DECLARER HAD NO idea what the double signified either|pg||
nt|lestergold: north calling TD what is going on?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 14 much needed imps in for england|pg||
nt|athene: 26 imp decision there |pg||
nt|lestergold: can operator shed light for us on what is happening here|pg||
nt|lestergold: something out of tempo?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north is complaining that numerous books have advocated "eight ever, nine never" and it didn't work on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: players are allowed to take misleading actions its part of the game|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: sorry could not understand their talking|pg||

nt|psridhar: after that 3H bid picking up clubs will be easier|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no!|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jameslee 2: looks like a 6@C final contract |pg||
nt|copeyj: it is possible but i still think if they try a slam it is odds on to go down - but... if you work out that E has 4-4 in majors, and follows to 3@D you know he has 1 or 2 @C but i ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S looks like rkcb for clubs|pg||
nt|yannis3012: y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: alternatively, North thought 3@H showed spades|pg||
nt|yannis3012: so u think its a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|copeyj: 800 on offer here i think|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: take the money and run!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 spades is a funny bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: jaja true good thinking |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still could bid 6@C ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: could but wont|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: south promissed points and hearts only|pg||
nt|psridhar: Townsend's X will discourage Gold -looking at QJ of spd himself, looks like pd is X ing with a stiff/void in spd..means he is not keen on slam?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Simon what do you think Gold will do ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Not sure in the slightest|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: y are right x is the end of bidding here|pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania in 6NX next door I am told|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@C doesn't look like an rkcb answer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Pass |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: so, eliminating that, we are left with 3@H being interpreted as spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yannis3012: they are lucky they stopped early then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: another push : break now|pg||
nt|christinas: yes, although he has an even hand, with 5-card major support you should always go straight to the 4-level (at least that is what Larry Cohen writes in the law)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jameslee 2: 5@S X |pg||

nt|lestergold: to play against him|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks that there will be a double squeeze anyway even with spades not breaking and that finesse losing|pg||

nt|psridhar: a preemptive splinter so to say|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 4 clubs sows 44 majors you can nearly cout the rest by playing dia first and have a better chance to make|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes but you dont know if east started 4@D1@c or 3@D2@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: true, but the chances are better for finessing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Director decision will make a 26 Imp,s diference |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think we all know that 4 club shows a hand that can play in both suits!|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is a question of guessing which hand E bid 4c on (1) 1098X,XXXX,XXX,QX or (2) 1098X,XXXX,XXXX,X -the second looks more likely|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: this can hardly be described as simple|pg||

nt|lestergold: n/s done well to bid this game with the oppos disruptive tactics|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S was 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: small diamond at trick 2 is quite likely|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: yes now kill point|pg||

nt|athene: in general when someone underleads through a KJ you play him for the ace rather than the queen|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will be suspiciopus but... not suspicious enuf!!!|pg||
nt|athene: because it's much easier to see an underlead from the ace is safe|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|mamos: I remember  John Armstrong saying that against a good player the earlier a Diamond was played in this situation the more likely it was that the player concerned had underled the ...|pg||
nt|mamos: Ace|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|athene: however, there is another issue here which is that a diamond switch was so marked on the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree but at that stage south doesnt know where ace of clubs well thism may be another life saver for england|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: west was surely leading a diamond from any holding|pg||
nt|athene: west knows that if south has a diamond loser it's probably going on the @SK|pg||

nt|lestergold: especially vulnerable when bidding these close games is so vital at teams|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: he will make 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: the match score is currently 18-12 to Romania -- some might feel that's a pretty significant recovery  by Engalnd and at least sis or seven more Vps than looked likely|pg||

nt|jaapfr: despite 27 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6N makes 6@c not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a fan of 2N on the S hand, especially facing an unpassed hand -- 2N is a real slam-killer. bad enough when opps preempt us, we dont have to do it to ourselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|petere: 1@D 2+ (not 10-12 bal)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: its a two suited hand not a balanced hand of course|pg||

mb|p|nt|lasu: tilanne siis Norjan eduksi 21-19 epävirallisen laskennan mukaan|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3S is minors - I gree bout 2NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petere: 1NT 13-15 bal|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: operator!!!!|pg||
mb|d|nt|petere: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|petere: 2@H done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: If East leads @D9 and North plays @D10 from dummy, East needs to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: must be heading for the doomed club slam|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wrong please change|pg||
mb|r|nt|lasu: kahta herttaa pelaa Antti toisessa huoneessa ja sai risti lähdön kurkon alta |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@D in Gold & doulbe in East |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: may play on hearts|pg||
nt|rado: no enough entries to check both red suits|pg||
nt|rado: now|pg||
nt|rado: enought|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 6C - not too lucky|pg||
nt|petere: 5 tricks for the defence, eh?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jameslee 2: redouble to show 1 control |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: a very reasonable contract on a normal club break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 42-36 with 1 board to go|pg||
nt|lesniak: wygrywa impas pik ale jak rozgrywac - ciezko powiedziec, zapytajcie Jacka pszczoly ktory jest na trybunach i suie na tym najlepiej zna|pg||
nt|lesniak: tzn zna sie na tym jak niewielu innych...|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 4h Gold will sign off|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now bw?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes seems he gives up !|pg||
nt|psridhar: this hopefully shd end the auction let s see|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see what South decide |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but south has extras|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i would bid 6 with the south hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has to see that he needs SPd Q, H ace, dia ACE, and KQ of club from Gold, unlikely he will bid 4s with those|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think that north shows about that with his 3 bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South takes his time |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we have more than 20 min for 2 boards---|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: 43 minuts left|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thkx muriel|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: especially played by south|pg||

nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wasnt down yet during the bidding either, but it will be|pg||
nt|lestergold: are u envisaging a pinning diamond finesse etc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt help|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my computer predicts nisht machen im afraid|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not envisioning anything except the person who sings at the end of things sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzers p[oint out that 6nt is an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Eamon well i think the singer will be Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tyhe end of this hand i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think mike said that at the start of the hand|pg||
nt|eamongall: Meanwhile over in London its 44-43 to one of the tennis players in the long game ... 8 hours now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or you did victor:)|pg||
