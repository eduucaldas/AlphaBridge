mb|3S|an|Relay to 3nt|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: The downside if these kidns of methods, allows the opponents free opportunities to make lead directing doubles|pg||

nt|dredog03: Andrew thinking about slam a little. 4Nt would be in jeopardy on a @s lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|dredog03: but on the @h lead, stands to make 5|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: 2@s is a little conservative whtie against red, but is suit is only headed by the jack|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jlrice: i dont know    will be tough to get to slam over 2@s  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: partner is going to have to have 2 cards outside of spdes just to give it play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Depending on their pre-empting style and how green would evaluate his hand, if 7 spades to the j109 might equal a good suit on an optimistic day :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|mc|12|nt|jlrice: not sure when that would be considered a good suit    but with a control in every other suit    is a pretty good preempt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 7 spades an an 8 count and a singelton is about as super max as u can get, the problem with regular ogust as opposed to mod ogust, sometimes u have to fudge either good suit or ...|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Perthaps Patchett was a bit hasty|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But u do have the 9, 7 of them & non vul so...|pg||
nt|dredog03: but 6@s cold with no way to guess wrong in clubs|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: See therein lay the problem|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vdoubleu: What was Adam (K) to do here?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He cld not p[aint the brush so fine as to play his partner for 2 Kings on the outside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Grossack asking about leads and carding. 9 is either 0 or 2 or top of nothing, they play UDCA and also UDA on first discard|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: agreed ;)|pg||
nt|caitlin: what are Green's options?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: Marriott and Hudson will have to stop quickly as games have very little play on this hand|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Art. Inquiry|nt|jlrice: i assume green will pass as Marriott will give a asking response|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: regardless I think W should explore before just bidding 4|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: is dbl cards, takeout of clubs, or lead directing ?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|6+ !c minimum hand|nt|dougdscsu: good thing to talk about with your partner|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Kaplan: "won't get there even if you don't bid 3@s" |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: playing a minor bid over a major preempt as natural is losing strategy (IMO)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: we'll never know:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: what does every1 bid here?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 1NT? or 2@c?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dredog03: wow. good 11 and 6 card suit. and pass. i think i might even open this one 1@C.|pg||
nt|dredog03: 2@C if its not drury ;)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i probably would've opened south's hand in the 1st place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess no drury|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Or, 3@c-if u play that as Inv--wld show this hand'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Srry meant 3@c...|pg||
nt|dredog03: yeah. i like the j/s to 3@c to show this kind of hand, even by unpassed hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I think that Richard thinks this is Drury, because Grossack just wrote a note and Richard held up 3 fingers, which sounds to me like saying it was 3 card Drury, but maybe not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C should definitely be invite if you play drury|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Now they r in trouble|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vdoubleu: It is a moot pt here, but|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Usually partnerships have agreements about what to lead from AK...holdings|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This has been a running theme w/Jnrs lately|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Lynn & I have been going over this at our Coaching Table|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Do not "run" to 3NT w/o fit for partner unless you have extra values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: eventually all learn not to play 3nt on misfits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Kaplan: "so he tried to sign off 3 times and you said no way?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Andrew "yes"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vdoubleu: lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vdoubleu: You'll see the big boys do it, but usually w/good reason|pg||
nt|fabsayc: adam teasing|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, of crse|pg||
nt|dredog03: well, the other table got to 3NT as well, but after a precisionish 2@c opening, and this has some chance, given the A doubleton of @h|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose he could try to drop queen doubleton in spades, with clubs as backup plan|pg||
nt|dredog03: he would need cooperation from E, too. as in covering the Q or playing low if he led low from dummy in clubs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vdoubleu: Good thing for Grossack he didn't duck club black K;)))|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hK|nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||

mb|1D!|an|can be 2|nt|fabsayc: i,e, trying to set up his own suit rather than partners|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|d|nt|vdoubleu: They got lucky that Brd 2 was a push|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Kaplan--out of spade + diamonds---soooo...sell him a club|pg||
nt|dredog03: do you like X or 1@s with Richard's hand?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|vdoubleu: In the OR they ducked the opening heart lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|vdoubleu: 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: These days, most players tend to bdi their 5-cd suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have seen a trend to double and then bid a new suit with minimum double|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But some might disagree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: But shldn't that show extras?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Doubling & then bidding yr 5-cd suit?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think overcall then double is the right way|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dredog03: yeah. i tend to double with that. and just sort of treat it like 4-4|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Kaplan: "let's see this beauty of yours, partner"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is part of the erosion of values|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|vdoubleu: North, Richard is 10 y/o|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: They are from the Atlanta area & obviously have been playing for at least 15 yrs:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Patchett asks for the convention card to look at leads|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 10 must show 1 or 2 higher?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Jan, are there screens?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfb: presumably - he looked, didn't ask, so I don't know for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: maybe 0 or 2|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Grossack: "no spades, partner?" Kaplan: "I did not bid them"|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe spade king discarding a club was better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dredog03: if he ruffs out the diamonds, it will set up a second @h trick for north. maybe trying to set up dummy's clubs was the winning line.|pg||

pc|d9|nt|dougdscsu: with 2-2 @d and 3-3 @s he will make 7 but with an unfavorable @d layout the play of the hand is not trivial|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: 6@d here?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vdoubleu: Or maybe 7?|pg||
nt|dredog03: or 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)right andre|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now this could be a gerber hand|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: (or shift)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Very strong 1NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need a lot of aces for slam|pg||
nt|dredog03: probably easier to get to after 1@h-2@d start. N would be a lot more cooperative in exploring @d slam|pg||
