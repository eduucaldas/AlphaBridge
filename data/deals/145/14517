nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||

nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||

nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||

nt|peachy: right. And if it does make, vul slam is expensive to miss|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|tomi2:  gogoman should ruff the heart now with the queen and wait por partners spade tricks later|pg||

nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||

nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
pc|dA|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
mc|12|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||

nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: opps|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||

nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||

nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: 1@C was strong, and 3@H creates big problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: who would have guessed 210 wins |pg||
nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2N|nt|paulhac:  Hi Paul|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this could now be very feisty|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: 170 will be flat|pg||

nt|motu: there it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think e/w may well declare a heart contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: level is questionable though|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: J@D lead beats 5@C would have tht west might have gone straight to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i guess it will be difficult to stay low here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow has some ideas on working / not working finesses in Grand Slams depending on vulnerbility and board number|pg||
nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry for the shouting|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the pass by east|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C is rkcb and 4NT 2+@SQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||

nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: they may open one or two points shorter|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pg||

nt|vasmar: probably south was afraid to double thinking that it woule be their only trick :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: a better 2nd half for Austria but still amassive difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam on here|pg||
nt|ady: regulation 4@S here for e/w|pg||

nt|roswolf: well i think it should be - this is the european championships|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk12: Links to Open B  Open A  and  Women|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I would raise him to 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: suddenly everyone's hand seems to have improved|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
