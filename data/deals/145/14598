nt|harlan: these are not the kind of hands the Das team wants to see right now.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: The action has already differed from the Open room, where E opened 3@c with his hand|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Quite a posiition!!:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: W/only 5 of them...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|moonbeam42: East in the Open room is a very wild preempter |pg||
nt|harlan: and totally balanced!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Noticed...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: He was in there on many hands that the average person would not be :)|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: ahhh, to be young|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, so true:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They have not learned fear yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|moonbeam42: Speaking of pushing around, in the open room, 2@h was opened on the E dreck and after some misdefense, managed to score up 3@h|pg||
nt|harlan: THere are many who would open the south hand 1@D to have a a 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|harlan: with the signalton K@S is not clear this is a reverse hand when you open|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Nor have they ever played bridge for money (0bv....)|pg||
nt|harlan: Well he is trying to keep up with Rizzo.  Rizzo has been doing some very agressive bidding today also.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|moonbeam42: Well, he was probably also trying to generate some action|pg||
mb|p|nt|moonbeam42: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|moonbeam42: Maybe it's Rizzo who is trying to keep up :)|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: After all, the Open room is already finished :P|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, but they must suspect they are doing well (Rizzo)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|moonbeam42: I would guess so|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzff: South's action on the 2nd round of the bidding should be "double" takeout |pg||
nt|harlan: I agree completely, JoAnna|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|harlan: It is possible there will not be a final segment.   But, I watched the Rizzo team come back from 40-0.  So They may well play it out and hope for a come back, too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well, I happened to peek ahead (at Brd 31) and...|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: Yes, I think the differential would have to be greater.  Although the last board of this segment is exciting, too.  We'll see what happens|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: hola|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  Against Das's preempts it's probably effective to balance with double with a wide range of hands and keep suit bids to be pretty decent|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|moonbeam42: Against Das' preempts, they should play fishbein|pg||

mb|3S|nt|harlan: I doubt E-W will go quitely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: do n-s play weak 2@D bid....it looks like one to me|pg||
nt|harlan: no The opening leader went passive.  I too am a more agressive leader usually|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|harlan: it looks like an opening bid to me  LOL|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vdoubleu: So another 10 IMPs here|pg||

nt|harlan: Raina made a good decision.  A winning Decision.  But will still lose imps|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||

nt|harlan: count*|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: lol, I'm in the opening camp, but I play precision, so everything is an opener to me :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this will be 11 imps to Rizzo, making the difference in the match a mere 2 imps|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: I wld have bid a direct 4@s w/the N hand|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I dont think it's close|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: Sometimes blasting can work.  We saw that last night when Kaplan played Rizzo.  Kaplan blased to 6@c and the defense had to take their two aces with no info.  |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: You eiter make it or not &...as we saw in OR...sometimes D, or lead, isn't perfect|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, we saw that Jenni|pg||
nt|harlan: it worked here, too!  at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and 4@S can be a good save on another day -- the AKJxx of diamonds didnt have to be opp a singleton|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vdoubleu: They had no idea which other A wld cash|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Poor partner looking at 65 of diamojnds when opening leader led the Diamond A|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: last board of this set,   match will resume with 32 more boards after a 1 hour break|pg||
mb|p|nt|moonbeam42: Very exciting :)|pg||
nt|harlan: I call this kind of hand (as declare) "Harlan Proof"  bidding it is the problem, ofc|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|harlan: Not vul, I would expect N-S to keep bidding over any noise from E-W|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: The minors bid should certainly slow down north.  It did in the open room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I dont see a game N-S....the uneven red suit divisions ought to scuttle 4@H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Shld West have opened 2@h here?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|moonbeam42: hmm, or not.  Looks like Rizzo will likely be in the lead heading into the second segment|pg||
nt|harlan: Well placed K@C, singleton @D, 4 @hs, and an ace to add to it.  I would bid 4H with the south hand.  That is how silly I can be!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Maybe he was napping:)|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: West is very conservative at these colors|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hmmm|pg||
nt|moonbeam42: Perhaps he wanted more shape|pg||
nt|harlan: yes,  but south missed a chance to cue bid.   I am not sure why the simple 5C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: spade led gives nothing away|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: Well, yes, who wldn't want more shape, but life aint always perfect.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: You have to bid the hands you are dealt|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Missed a 4@d bid, right Harlan|pg||
pc|s3|nt|harlan: this is sad, to get a great hand like souths and not even move to slam|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|harlan: yes, South won't like the 4H cue from N, but can still give it one more shot with 4S|pg||
nt|harlan: the 4@H cue after 4@ds|pg||
