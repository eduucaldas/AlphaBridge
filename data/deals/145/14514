mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Both pairs very similar styles - opening club either weak or stroing balanced, or natural |pg||
nt|mamos: really?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW three weak twos, NS 2-bids somewhat unusual|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as indeed is this contract|pg||
nt|mamos: South 3@D all Pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: yes, td is called|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South passed 3@C and West bid 3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@D showed 0-7any|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: perhaps South thought he was cueing Wests Diamonds|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: yes 2 or 3d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: anyone know the 1NT range?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says (14)15-17|pg||
nt|haans: do not expect a dim loser|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Makeable contract, the defense taking 1@C+1@H+1@S=3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello haans.|pg||
nt|haans: bad lead :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||

nt|lestergold: and will do well if he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: even one off no disaster|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cannot shorten trumps from both hands to avoid 4-1 break, small @C to table to play @H.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This would be bid in OR and would be a flat board |pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

nt|mamos: not the way to start a 20 board match|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: it's like losing a wicket to the first ball of an innings - not the best of starts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW will be keen to get on   NS might want to go a little slow for five minutes|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: East opened a 15-17 NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mamos: this is a 9-12 NT i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sJ|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||

pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||

nt|mamos: flat board   interesting hand|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: yes. Board 1, however, was not flat|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mamos: Note Wests aggressive vul overcall|pg||

nt|mdgraham: always a thing to bear in mind when contemplating slam - how good your trumps are |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@C would be good if North had (say) @HKx and @CJxxx, but not clear how NS could have bid the suit naturally. |pg||

nt|haans: maybe corrected?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Simon late... go stand in corner|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H two-suiter???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome simon|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|shevek: 7-10(11) 5], not 4[|pg||
nt|xenya: unless something very unusual happened |pg||
nt|shevek: 5@h not 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very lucky diamonds for the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: i had duties getting cereal bars for a certain D Gold|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems reop X would help East to visualize|pg||
nt|copeyj: although they can make 5@D too |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however still makes 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||

nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||

nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 6@c depends on guessing who has the doubleton @h A (or singleton)|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||

nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cA|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: a much needed 12 imps to england on the way here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: good discarding from Townsend|pg||
pc|h2|nt|copeyj: pls don't say such things until they are racked up Mike - no tempting fate ty|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and good discarding from both of them|pg||
nt|copeyj: helping each other to make the hand double dummy for both|pg||
nt|lestergold: both card perfect but as i said you would not expect l;ess from players at this level|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: big swing in for England thanks to Tosh's 3S overcall in the other room. he will be surprised to get a dressing-down from his coach:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty gl there|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 12 tricks in NT on non @D lead - and on a @D lead you will have to guess whether to play T or Q if played by South (solid played by N)|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rnmalik: what happened is beyond me:) |pg||
nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u arent playing because ur needed as a coach|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||

nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||

nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
pc|s8|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||

nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||

pc|c4|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||

pc|c2|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||

nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||

nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||

mb|2H|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||

pc|h6|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||

nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||

nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||

nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||

nt|shevek: hahaha they made 6@h on both sides!|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||

mb|4S|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep but no comments:) K@S scores at 4@S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a passive @D lead would have been more challenging, but i think declarer can survive even then|pg||
nt|copeyj: a strong @C for Gromov this time|pg||

nt|vasmar: i think a conservative bid by w|pg||

nt|ady: england have got big swings on 2 slam hands   one 50-50 and are fortunate to be ahead |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: I think Gold is scared that they may have missed a game and doesnt want to push his luck knowing they cannot outbid e/where|pg||

nt|vasmar: he has 4 good cards in majors|pg||
nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||

nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
