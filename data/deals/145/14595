nt|vugraphzfk: Welcome back again, this is the 6th of 8 segments, and still a very close match|pg||
mb|2H!|an|Intermediate|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|chorush: I think EW will find the 5 club save which turns into a make. Double dummy NS can be beaten in 5 hearts but not likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: correct -- and 6@c would be a good save|pg||
nt|chorush: "par" is 5SX down one but par is a hard tskmaster|pg||
nt|harmon: Im all for bogies|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chorush: now a clear 4H and 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|chorush: I don't understand Fleisher's pass of 4C|pg||
nt|jlall: I wonder if kamil had just bid 4@H over 2@H if greco would have passed|pg||

nt|chorush: this is going to be a fair plus position for Diamond to begin the sixth of 8 stanzas|pg||
nt|passell: push|pg||
nt|chorush: same in closed room Mike?|pg||
nt|henryb:  There does not seem to be much to choose between the two teams. Both do a lot of good things, and have their misfortunes also|pg||
nt|jlall: NS were not in a forcing pass here so kamil couldn't pass to suggest that he wanted to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I would think the cue would set up a forcing pass, no?|pg||
nt|jlall: i think it could just be a game try?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|henryb:  Depends what 2@h was. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted as Intermediate|pg||

nt|kit: Pass by Gitelman should be forcing here I think, and if he does Moss can bid 5@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfd: hello everyone,   I got here late and I dont know which minor west opened :   guessed @D because of lead|pg||
nt|me argent: it takes an unlikely @S lead to beat 5@Hs|pg||
nt|kit: But he chose to show preference for defending -- questionable|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: Hampson says:  I hope you are not club short|pg||
nt|kjadams: Good Morning|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: Hi all ... |pg||
nt|me argent: weinstein gives a good description of his hand with natural 4nt bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|passell: a major suit lead might have given him little chance now it looks like no chance at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks for joining us Mike (passell) always nice to have a Hall of Famer helping with the play  by play|pg||
nt|me argent: with @Cs splitting declarer will have no problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Good morning and welcome all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: declarer might overtake heart Q here.|pg||
nt|sharynr: great lead, cuts what little he had in communication|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch all other vugraph tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    the Juniors are NOT playing same boards as Open|pg||
nt|me argent: sure declarer will pvertake @HQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|me argent: not sure if pass by north would have been forcing|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like declarer can set up the diamonds and make -- those 5-5 fits play nicely|pg||
nt|kit: how could it not be forcing -- North showed invite values, and South bid voluntary game|pg||
nt|me argent: south hasnt showen def wiyh 4@Hs so why is pass forcing kit?|pg||
nt|me argent: all north has done is say i have a good hand for @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: South didn't have to bid 4@H, since opponents only in 3@C -- so 4@H bid is to make, so force exists|pg||
nt|me argent: and south said fine lets try 4@Hs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|passell: thnx  always happy to be in your company|pg||
nt|sharynr: it will be tough to stop 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  team names are fipped in this room|pg||
nt|henryb:  Diamond is N-S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: okay, I am not sure how to fix that....|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think you have to get off and restart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at this table definitely Diamond-Platnick sitting n-s......are the players sitting right at other table?|pg||
nt|henryb:  but I do not know|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzfd: from my point of view:  the score appears to be correct (fleisher 28, diamond 45)   is that what you see also?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: with only Q9xxx@s, doesn't seem good|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: dbl game swing  but a push|pg||
nt|chorush: as it happens South would have realized that the opponents were perhaps not saving|pg||
nt|jlall: a close 6@S here if they bid it|pg||
nt|henryb:  marginal, but seems like you should bid 4@h opposite an intermediat with three trumps, AK and stiff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CCs for all Fleisher partnerships online under  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: jump overcall was intermediate -- only at unfavorable vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jlall: with south having a doubleton heart, it will probably go down, but he obviously could make double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: it seems non weak jump shifts are such a wide range  have not seen a lot of success stories|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jlall: 2N is 4144 or 42(34)|pg||
nt|jlall: greco has super max balanced hand for their style |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: yes he does including K of hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have a lady here at our club who wants to play intermediate jump overcalls. I told her that when she could define them well, I would play them with her|pg||
nt|jlall: I don't know if they play serious or non serious or if it is on (since last bid was 2N), but if it is I think he will show a serious slam try|pg||
nt|chorush: I know I shouldnt say this but I think there is a good chance for Greco to make 6S if he gets there|pg||
nt|henryb:  13 years later she is still trying and I still have not played them.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|passell: yes especially with the expected club lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jlall: so 3N is artificial, im not sure if it's serious or non serious though|pg||
nt|jlall: do you know which they play mike?|pg||
nt|passell: must be serious  he has it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond team CCs [not gitelman-moss] under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah i agree|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW no mention of serious/non-serious on CC :(|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, now it will make for sure|pg||
nt|passell: hampson waiting for 4h bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|passell: the dbl makes it 100 percent to make it|pg||
nt|jlall: kamil doubled hoping his club king was behind the ace, and his partner would lead one through, pretty normal with a king and an ace in a slam auction, but it wont work here|pg||
nt|robinswr: i like non-serious 3nt. why cuebid if you're going to be in a touch and go game contract|pg||
nt|jlall: yes me too|pg||
nt|chorush: me three|pg||
nt|passell: I totally agree|pg||
nt|jlall: greco must be thinking of keycarding, or just bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: me five lol|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serious 3N makes better sense in big club systems|pg||
nt|jlall: if he has made a serious slam try then 4@H seems enough|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jlall: since his trumps are bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: in a bid club system 3spades has to be a slam try|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jlall: now with 3-2 trumps he is cold|pg||

qx|c77|st||md|3ST6H52DT953C98643,SKQ98HQ9764DAKQCQ,SJ74HAJ83D764CK52,SA532HKTDJ82CAJT7|sv|b|nt|kjadams: hard to see how they took only 11 after the spade lead in other room.   2S 4H 1D 5C|pg||
nt|kit: if South thinks he can make 4@H, then how bad can it be to compete to 5@H if both players believe their hands are more suited for offense than defense?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: This hand appears to be an easy 4 spades for NS, with the diamond ace right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands -- attacking @C would have let contract make - but i think playing @H gave better chance of going down ONLY 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and no reason @HKx couldn't be in west|pg||
nt|kit: Just because we are in a force doesn't mean it is our hand -- sometimes the pair in the force is the one taking the save|pg||
nt|me argent: same contract in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|Transfer|nt|ahollan1: another [ugly?] upgrade to 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many pointing out  low @C [not cashing Ace] before @H finesse better -- works in actual case and @H finesse still available if @C not good|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharynr: i guess he didnt overtake the heart, then had no entry left for the 4th one|pg||
nt|me argent: must admit i am a 2@C overcaller with souths hand a TOX wouldnt enter my mind|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am with you Joey|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: they will end in 4@S whatever north opened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: K&R  thinks north is worth all of 12.30    http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|lml: dies it count the nice 10's|pg||
nt|lml: does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 14-16   2@D= @H or @S|pg||
nt|me argent: EW get to test their slam bidding over a weak NT opening|pg||
mb|2S|an|gf|nt|lml: I think it is 13 no more and no less|pg||
nt|me argent: on this auction east will accept all invitations|pg||
nt|kit: Should be pretty easy slam to bid -- making it might be another matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|lml: hi Allan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- K&R looks at 10s -- but really doesn't like Queens|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  I mean the team names. Both of you have them backward|pg||
nt|lml: well they go better with the 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in combination|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: they don't want to get too high here but I don't imagine they will|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S = safe but 5@S = not safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could be "Baze"  @S raise, unspecified shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 & 9 card suits have not been all that rare this week|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then 4@C=1@C  [3N would be some void]|pg||
nt|lml: whatever they are doing they doing have the tickets for a slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C takes the early Tap to beat.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharynr: and they have found the lead!|pg||
nt|me argent: with souths hand why make double for takeout when you dont want partner to bid any suit but @Cs|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know if Martel's sequence is bidding out his pattern or what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I've hardtime reading the notes from where I am..all bids alerted|pg||
nt|kit: The slam can be made double-dummy, of course, by taking a winning heart or club finesse, but in practice I think it will go down|pg||
nt|kit: Most likely line is heart to king and pass 10 of hearts ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: any explanation to the 3@D bid Operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no explanation given to 3d|pg||
nt|kjadams: finding the winning defense would be superhuman.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharynr: well that wont work!|pg||
nt|kjadams: undo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3d actually by Diamond..I will correct|pg||
nt|3for3: They are slamming in Open room, and Kamil has doubled a 4@C bid, so that will make things easier for the @D Team|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer has judged to draw trumps first that will be okay, as he can take ruffing finesse.  If he didn't draw trumps, third round of hearts beats him.|pg||
nt|me argent: cant see them stopping short now|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR a 4@C Q bid was doubled by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS using udca|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphzfd: as to the team names on the green vugraph bars:  yes the names are entered there reversed|pg||
nt|lml: 6 imps to Diamond when Greco-Hampson got a plus in a partscore on the previous deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: e-w lead 3rd from even, low from odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for 5 of 6 pairs in finals are available online  follow link for the team under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=18&task=list|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that Greco is safe no matter what he does since Fleisher can only give Kamil one ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: !Q very loud scream for @S shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: its obvious what 3@Ds from east was|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D9 2nd scream for @S|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: say WHAT?|pg||
nt|me argent: an overbid|pg||
nt|kit: After Martel Q-bid Stansby decided he had a max, so he drove it in via RKC|pg||
nt|me argent: of course it would help if i read what other people wrot instead of just concentrating on my 1 finger typing:(|pg||
nt|kit: Gitelman will probably make passive diamond lead, as he has strong heart holding|pg||
nt|3for3: Fleisher led a low @C, covered all around, so that hand is done|pg||
nt|kit: The best line may be to start with heart to king.  If it holds, draw trumps and ride 10 of hearts, which almost has to work.  If loses to ace, then may have to try something else.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|me argent: whoops|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Well, this makes it very easy.  Gitelman is hoping his partner has a stiff heart -- certainly possible.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco has to guess the trump jack|pg||
nt|lml: yes he does but Kamil was less likely to lead a singleton with good trump so I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein flew @HA then dropped @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: thats the easy way!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more info at other table where opening lead was dummy's suit.   Here Fleisher's non-double of 3@H lulled declarer into playing low|pg||
nt|3for3: Gitelman was hoping for partner to have a stiff @H, certainly reasonable|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfd: I will check with COO and see what to do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Platnick should have concealed @s4 to prevent the tap|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|robinswr: 2clubs natural is alertable|pg||
nt|passell: likely to get to 3nt now|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1club could be 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|passell: both players went low   a rarity|pg||
nt|henryb:  Mike, wouldn't the natural play be a heart to the K, then run the @h 10, and take the ruffing hook against the (virtually) marked @hA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: very unhampsonlike to pass, he probably thinks his overcall here has a stronger minimum than usual since its the suit RHO opened|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|me argent: the open and closed rooms are good examples on why to bid agressive slams the opening lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: notice over the nebulous 1@D how Kamil's DBL focuses just on majors|pg||
nt|lml: its probably easiest to do if West is on lead |pg||
nt|lml: the diamond ruff|pg||

nt|reisig: 3@hX is better :)|pg||
nt|me argent: think levin much too strong for his preempt|pg||
nt|me argent: brave 2@S bid by moss|pg||
nt|kit: I have never understood the purpose of overcalling 1@S on a hand like North's.  2@S I can see, but what good can come of 1@S?|pg||
mb|r|nt|lml: so two chances to find the ruff|pg||

nt|me argent: but he must have knowen something i didnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss opened the west hand   Martel obviously likes better 12 counts for unfav 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hampson might try 3 rounds of @C [with finesse]|pg||
nt|lml: good point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Weinstein in 5@D  --  that won't fetch either|pg||
nt|algraves: it really is an " obvious " singleton |pg||
nt|kit: Moss will probably defend with his 4-3-3-3 shape|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: Both pairs miss the good game here.  Not clear anyone did anything terrible though|pg||

pc|d5|nt|algraves: the ectasy and the agony|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|kit: Problem at this table was that Martel could have been real light for the 3rd seat opening, so Stansby felt right to pass 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: final contract is 3@C West -- that should be an interesting race|pg||
nt|robinswr: martel has shown up with 2 aces and is a passed hand so he can't(shouldn't) have the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: or the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D a good contract -- just needs @DJ singleton/doubleton or @HA onside|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: This hand illustrates how powerful aces are in conjunction with long suit for 3NT purposes.  If ace of hearts were KQ, 3NT not so good.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|me argent: NEXT|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|3for3: Perhaps that is the problem with 'real light' 3d seat openings|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2H|an|good !s raise|nt|jlall: 2@H shows a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|jlall: greco didnt open 1N here because they play 15-17 in 4th seat|pg||
nt|robinswr: kamil can double to show 4 hearts and then bid clubs to show 4 hearts and at least four clubs (could be more)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: great bid. playing in clubs when 4hearts could be cold|pg||
nt|passell: better hand to balance on then getting involved at this vulnerability for south  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like they use standard count on lead of ace|pg||
nt|passell: caught his partner with a great hand still going minus|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlall: declarer needs to negotiate a spade ruff here, if they ruff a heart he hopes they do so with a natural club trick (as they do here)|pg||
nt|robinswr: however, make the 7 of spades the 7 of clubs and 4hearts would have made and they would be in 3clubs |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|jlall: 4@H would still need 3-2 hearts with the king on and 2-2 clubs then |pg||
nt|robinswr: kamil had the perfect chance to show both suits. double 2hearts to show hearts and then bid 3clubs over 2spades|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|robinswr: only reason 4hearts doesn't make is because his partner psyched a takeout double|pg||

nt|algraves: so a 2 imp pickup for diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: against my preempts it's right to pass with North hand.   Seems not so vs Levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [not 19-20 bal]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a worthy 12-14|pg||

nt|robinswr: i would have opened but i open some balanced 11's|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: 4@S touc and go|pg||
nt|lml: Hampson cant love the turn this auction has taken... how to get in the minors...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D & @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the problem with DONT is that you don't know the lengths of the two suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 3@Hs = 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|3for3: Perhaps Martel should have competed earlier....maybe via a good bad 2nt|pg||
nt|me argent: will he or wont he?|pg||
nt|3for3: He will I guess|pg||
nt|me argent: i know i couldnt pass|pg||
nt|kit: If he wants to compete, much safer to make immediate takeout double IMO|pg||
nt|kit: Since partner passed hand, partner can't bury you in too deep a grave|pg||
nt|me argent: danger alot less when west has showen a limited fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: dangerous spot for Levin to double but his side can make 2 or 3 spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: kib points out that best def does set the last hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: I disagree -- more danger when opponents have described their hands to each other|pg||
nt|me argent: moss agrees with you kit|pg||
nt|kit: And a potential double part-score swing from South's silence, as 2@S and 3 of something might well be making|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: a good disciplined pass I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: this should go down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: he cant get enough pitches for his hearts without the opposition ruffing|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is the killing lead and North will just play normally , pitch a heart and play spades. He has no reason not to expect 7 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is reluctant to duck first heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Also, immediate takeout double only commits us to 2-level, while delayed double forces to 3-level -- big consideration as far as safety is concerned|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kjadams: sky 1st club and arrange for 2 diamond ruffs with spade as entry.|pg||
nt|me argent: always a mistake to double a partscore when best one can do is beat it 1 wiith perfect defence too many accidents can happen|pg||
nt|me argent: change the blackQs and it would have been double partscore|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kjadams: yes.  I am sure North wanted to bid "undouble"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Weinstein needs an uppercut to get three trumps to go with three aces|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chorush: look like diamond should start with the spade K|pg||
nt|kit: btw I agree with Moss's actions -- just pointing out that it is better to double immediately than to wait|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1N=good 13-16    Martel's NT would be 12-14  will he open 1N or 1@D? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think just coincidence that 2@D bid corresponds to DONT    actually 2minor = minor + unknown major|pg||
nt|robinswr: same principle|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|chorush: If I were Martel, I might think the trick taking potential of this hand is more than 14|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|me argent: east just has given declarer a chance to go down 2|pg||
nt|sharynr: I think he has to go for it|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|sharynr: these opps wil not screw up the trump suit|pg||
nt|me argent: he cant settle for 1 down no profit in that|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|s8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Defense gets diamond ruffs, but unfortunately has to solve declarer's heart guess|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|lml: without a double there is no reason to play for this spade break.  this was all normal|pg||
pc|c6|nt|algraves: the second heart is disappointing|pg||
nt|algraves: to north|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Ira --  K&R says north worth 15.90   http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: hampson follows the rule and ducks the first trump he who has the high trump has an advantage|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|me argent: down 2 as advertised|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: the @S9 is even more disappointing|pg||

nt|jlall: if south ever bids 4N he will be disappointed, but with the @CK on the 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|chorush: wonder if he will bid 1D?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i wonder if 2hearts is a multi-way bid|pg||
nt|jlall: this might be multi-way including strong jump shift in hearts?|pg||
nt|passell: bad vulnerability for ew to get involved|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2spades asks why south bids 2hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: well he certainly has SJS|pg||
nt|jlall: I'm told its invitational in NT or strong jump shift in hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i play it as a mixed raise also 7-9 with 4+ support for partner's minor|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jlall: maybe not|pg||
nt|robinswr: the mixed raise is very hard to show playing standard methods|pg||
nt|chorush: if Hampson leads a club Fleisher has no choice but to shrug his shoulders and finesse|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@S was likely keycard, and 5@C 1 or 4|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4spades keycard|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|robinswr: fleisher could have bid 1diamond (showing hearts) which would have gotten north to play the hand|pg||
nt|chorush: but they might have no way to show what he had then|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess he would never open 1club with no aces|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|chorush: anyway Fleisher happy with the lead. Will wind up making 6 if they dont play spade|pg||
nt|passell: another likely push   players would be surprised to know the score is 2-0 this set  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
mc|11|nt|jlall: when a good player bids keycard and stops, its a safe bet they're off 2 keycards, so greco knew it was very likely he could cash partners spade ace|pg||
nt|passell: his 3heart bid must have been accepting 3nt also|pg||
nt|jlall: also fleisher never has Txx of diamodns on this auction so the DA is very unlikely to cash|pg||
nt|passell: unlikely to be aceless|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss auction    1@C-3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even if north reads the trump -- would need west to follow to 3@C to ditch @H loser|pg||
mb|1C|nt|algraves: yes he played normally with hope for sucess if hearts were 7-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: predict 5@Hs final contract|pg||
nt|kit: 9-bagger, but probably flat board as E-W can't do much do to vulnerbility|pg||
mb|1H|nt|robinswr: hampson has a balanced hand this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a pinochle|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby will double showing diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Having talked a lot with Steve at this tournament, I know that he is a strong proponent of leaving doubles like this one in. It is not the major disaster that 2 of a major would ...|pg||
nt|chorush: be, but a possible adverse swing of 7 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: five+ diamonds and he hopes to bid spades next|pg||
mb|1N|an|usually 4S+bal|nt|lml: or the @S9 was onside|pg||
nt|algraves: so the big clubbers get to practice their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, any shape|pg||
nt|kit: If 4NT is regular Blackwood, that's what I think Moss should have bid|pg||
nt|kit: Even right-sides the contract when partner has 2 aces|pg||
nt|me argent: or 4@Cs regular gerber|pg||
nt|kit: Plus, what fun to say:  Bet you'll never get this good trump support, as he puts down the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2spades probably shows a doubleton spade and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby could have bid 2hearts (Michaels) but he wanted to get his lead director in|pg||
nt|algraves: hello again bridge fans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome canada|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2spades might have been hampsons only superaccept if 2diamonds didn't promise hearts and was a 2-way convention|pg||
mb|3H|an|slamish|nt|3for3: Kit is not a big fan of worrying about 5 level jeopardy, but it seems there should be some way of staying off the 5 level when you have all that bidding space.|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so NS can make 2H|pg||
mb|4C|nt|me argent: should make 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this auction protects against immediate @D attack -- but there is plenty of time|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think that when greco declines the invitation, stansby should bid his spades|pg||
nt|me argent: draw trumps 4 rds of @Ss pitch a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Daimond: Could be 19|pg||
mb|4N|nt|algraves: EW a lot of spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin opened 1N as good 14-17, Weinstein Texas transfers into 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: his partner is marked for values if the opponents don't get to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled and again  North becomes declarer  and both lead @CJ|pg||
nt|kit: Problem with this approach is that partner won't like his potential weak heart holding, so might not cooperate when slam is there|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: slightly conservative rebid and NS will miss the aggressive 4 heart contract that would make on a good day|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: 6@H wouldnt be bad if Hampson just had the @CK instead of the queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: they might make it on this layout depending on the lead|pg||
nt|algraves: meanwhile they can make at 5 @H from south , 4@S from north|pg||
nt|lml: without a diamond lead they can discard diamonds on spades and go about setting up clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is true|pg||
nt|algraves: but they really dont have the stuff to bid too much higher|pg||
nt|lml: no they shouldnt be there for sure|pg||
nt|lml: its just that if they get carried away in the auction they may luck out|pg||
nt|algraves: they might crawl up to 5 but that seems pushy|pg||
nt|algraves: we dont know what there bids mean in any depth, but they do undoubtedly . so all we can do is wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe JoAnna will learn if   a) 1N limits hand beyond 8-11 bal  b) 3@C agree @H|pg||
nt|lml: the thing is that from Greco's point of view 8-11 is enough if its the right cards|pg||
nt|lml: the @CK alone would make it decent add the a major jack and even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Playing a variant of 2 way checkback, 3@H should say 'don't worry about trumps...I am slamming in hearts and just need controls...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have smpathy with giant leap over 1s - not my choice but immediate 4NT could be winner|pg||
nt|kit: difficult to stop when you just want to ask for aces|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves: well he needs some key jacks to make it a good slam|pg||
nt|algraves: and the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: South passed initially and would have opened 1@D with bal 11 so South is limited|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher can kill the whole thing if he leads the @DA if they do get to slam since the @Ck has to score|pg||
nt|algraves: JXX, KJXX, AXX  XXX is a good 6 hearts basically needing 3-2 trump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hard to pass looking at your own hand but once you try any rational reconstruction....|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|algraves: whatever 4@S was Hampson had had enough|pg||
nt|lml: he knew they could safely play in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key for me will be explanation of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: North alerted 4@S,    and South did not alert 4@S     earlier bidding showed exactly 3@S4@H in south|pg||
nt|robinswr: but no redouble|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aha   thanks JoAnna|pg||
nt|algraves: so they had a key card misunderstanding here , Where is Eddie Kantar when they need him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it seems that 3@C was part of the pattern showing to describe 3-4 majors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|algraves: but they come out ok|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps the misunderstanding saved a bunch of imps or vice versa ... we will never know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves: Kamil wants to overtake and play a third round for the over ruff|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|lml: overruff overruffed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|algraves: but that means declarer made a soft play at ttrick one|pg||

nt|robinswr: KQJx/xxx/KQx/Kxx|pg||
mb|1S|nt|passell: yes  very unlucky then|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Fleisher just commented that if Michael had showed 0 or 3, he might have left him in 4N :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: club lead big winner here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: hampson's 3N may seem aggressive but it is their style to be in all 24 HCP 3Ns if they can...they don't miss many games!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|passell: 3 discards will be difficult for Fleisher here|pg||
nt|passell: he will have to pitch a heart and 2 spades to make Greco guess at the end|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you are in notrump and don't need your long suit for entries, usually it's good to run your long suit and make them find discards|pg||
nt|passell: yes  discarding is the toughest part of bridge|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|robinswr: but on the run of the diamonds  north-south can signal in diamonds which would help their partner |pg||
nt|jlall: greco perhaps testing for 98 or Q9 doubleton of spades with north, but the @S4 lead if 4th best marks south with AQ84|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like that play is getting ready to play Fleisher for the heart ace|pg||
nt|passell: but he gives Fleisher an extra chance to give him his 9th trick|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 853 of diamonds are equals so they can be played in any order to show which suit you like|pg||
nt|passell: that is true but on this 1 it would help declarer more|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jlall: might have worked better to strip the diamonds before doing this, but that gives them a chance to signal also, and lets them know you have 5 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|robinswr: north can play the 853 to say he really likes hearts. south can play 69 of diamonds to show clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hT|nt|me argent: EW look to be off the obvious 4 aces|pg||

nt|kit: And far from cold|pg||
nt|me argent: but in practise tough to beat even with declarers help|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has problem here, but will likely go up king.  10@H rusinow, so South should hold queen, and would Gitelman have led from J108xx with partner overcalling spades?|pg||

nt|lml: but they can hold this to 3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: the diamond lead was a good lead and they now need to play trumps|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents work it out|pg||

nt|me argent: now its all over except for the agony|pg||
nt|chorush: declarer flew with the K and Gitleman will not be happy that he led the 10|pg||
nt|chorush: on last hand in 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: the clb 10 return asked for a spade|pg||
nt|robinswr: heart to the 9 was not his best start|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|robinswr: martel should have split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin took much better line  he won @CA and played @H to 8  :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: asking how do hearts break?|pg||
nt|robinswr: lead the queen and when its not covered he doesn't have it|pg||

nt|jlall: sound opener for greco here|pg||
nt|passell: yes  likely|pg||
mb|1D|an|2+|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: hampson has chosen to bypass spades with all the suits double stopped, 4333, and bad spades|pg||
nt|jlall: i like it a lot personally|pg||
pc|h5|nt|passell: a good practical bid he may make this while 4spades was unlikely to make|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall: yes this is a perfect example of why it might be good to do this, if you bid 1@S and offer 3N later partner will go back to spades with 5422 every time, but 3N is better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: probably misguess diamonds trying to keep south off lead|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|passell: he has to get out with a dia or spade now or curtains|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jlall: now if north guessed to play a spade somehow, hampson would always pop king since if south has the ace he is in big trouble anyways with a heart through|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mslair: both tables playing near perfect bridge|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: now dummy will be endplayed|pg||
nt|jlall: i think hampson had to play the ace of clubs before playing the diamond|pg||
nt|jlall: playing for the SA onside|pg||
nt|passell: yes ducking the diamond gave him that chance|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlall: i dont know what kamil is thinking of doing, if partner has the SQ then a club will endplay dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|robinswr: still has to guess the correctly to make|pg||
nt|jlall: so hampson has to guess...he knows theyve made a mistake either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Hampson asking if they play smith -- Answer by Fleisher is no|pg||
nt|jlall: if the spade ace is on his right, he is in trouble anwyays though|pg||
nt|passell: yes  tough to guess what mistake has been made sometimes|pg||
nt|jlall: a heart will come back through|pg||
nt|jlall: then if kamil has QTx of spades hes still down|pg||
nt|robinswr: if north has the queen of spades he knows his partner has the ace|pg||
nt|passell: only Qx |pg||
nt|jlall: so playing the king wins always when kamil has the ace, and only some of the time when kamil has the queen|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|passell: strange not dummy locking declarer|pg||
nt|jlall: so the math play is the king, but of course hampson is going to try to reason out the whole hand and figure out what north has|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Justin predicted if response was 1@S    Stansby pulled 3N to 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might make 4spades though with a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C5|pg||
nt|harmon: Adam go knock geoff on head and sayyy pssst.Justin says king right|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson is asking himself why they played a spade...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: nah, I can't be bothered to get off this stack of chairs|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult to figure out why he wasnt put in the dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: but it is the wrong play whether they have the ace or the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: so i dont think he can read too much into it|pg||
nt|chorush: only way this might not be wrong play is if stiff ace|pg||
nt|jlall: i think he should just go with the math here |pg||
nt|jlall: but i see all the hands |pg||
nt|chorush: rarely get them wrong from up here|pg||
nt|robinswr: its easy to play the king looking at where the ace is|pg||
nt|jlall: geoff might be reading into the fact that they shifted to a club rather than a spade the first time|pg||
nt|passell: also wonder why he wasnt dummy locked now|pg||
nt|jlall: with Axx of spades and Qxx of clubs a spade shift is possible immediately, but with Qx Qxx in the blacks he would always play a club first|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|me argent: nope east is a man wiyh disipline|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin is pondering his options|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a heart lead will beat 3nt  4spades no play|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes.  As Hamman put it after zia underled... He did not want to make a discovery play only to discover he had made the wrong play.|pg||
nt|3for3: Matel will offer choice of games|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby can open 1@D with no rebid problems holding spade suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: any chance Levin PASS?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess so :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I would pass with Levins hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: hampson must have missorted his hand and didn't see that he had 5 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now DBL-P-2@H-2@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|passell: I like 1nt |pg||
nt|passell: more likely dbl rdbl by Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh forgot about RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike -- is determining factor between P and 1N the @DJ?|pg||
nt|3for3: With 4333 it always pays to think about nt|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will pick  4@S with 2 doubletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: yes for me the J of diamonds is a huge card|pg||
nt|chorush: some pairs play that P here is penalties and have to bid if not|pg||
nt|passell: Hate 1nt  it slows down the opponents |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close was Greco to bidding over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: @D bottom of his range so gets too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: north has an uncomfortable lead|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead safest here, and probably best -- he holds all the high cards|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|3for3: Of course low is safer and better than the ace..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfd: for about 2 seconds|pg||
nt|robinswr: i overcall at the one-level if i have a five-card suit and 8 points. the suit must be at least 65432|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no worse|pg||
nt|algraves: when the clubs go bad he is going to need the Ace of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|kit: This is helpful for declarer -- now there is some chance.  On trump lead and heart back, he had no chnce|pg||
nt|3for3: he still will need to guess the @D's.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|passell: he knows partner is bidding on shape from the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what the record is for most RDBL in single auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin has the green card half way to the tray then puts it back...thinking|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chorush: I had one against cohen-berkowitz with 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|passell: I would through away the rdbl card if I got the chance|pg||
nt|chorush: final contract was 3NT undoubled down 1|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps they have their own opinion of what they overcall|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR kamil opened 1nt showing 15 17 pts and partner passed|pg||
nt|kit: I must say I am baffled about the opening lead.  Everything (enemy bidding, his holding all the high cards), seems to indicate a trump lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|passell: maybe platnick is giving his partner a chance to bid with 6dia and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|passell: in case partner was 1363|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think 2S here by Levin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: you certainly guessed the think part right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves: ok|pg||
nt|lml: this hand will not be easy|pg||
nt|algraves: no lots to do|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher's biggest problem is to sort out the spade suit|pg||
nt|algraves: seems natural to just go down |pg||
nt|lml: probably|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|chorush: difficult to see how the play will go but the cards lie splendedly for Diamond|pg||
nt|passell: looks like plus 110|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps he feared dummy tabling with good diamonds, and needing his partner to have @C King|pg||
nt|kit: Now must unblock ace of clubs before playing 2nd trump|pg||
nt|3for3: He knows dummy has 5 diamonds, in all likelihood.  If they were KQxxx he'd need to get aggresive|pg||
nt|kit: but he has 2 entries, declarer balanced for 3NT call, etc.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: might win imps just by playing 2@H regardless of +110/-50|pg||
nt|algraves: anything else is taking a big position|pg||
nt|lml: I cant think of any excuse for playing spades right|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|lml: they took the normal spade play in the other room which is cashing the ace and then leading one up|pg||
nt|robinswr: in this case it even though you can make 4hearts, it probably didn't matter|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: north better cash out here|pg||
nt|3for3: Now a heart through and declarer totally dead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|passell: good point Al he could have been 1354|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless gitelman-moss go minus in 3/4@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: a normal result of one down here too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|lml: but he gets points for making the book play ... no imps just points|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: he had a chance if he had unblocked ace of clubs.  He could then win heart return, cash king of clubs pitching heart, and run 10 of diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|nt|me argent: trump? who needs to lead a trump?|pg||
nt|3for3: If you do lead a trump on hands like this, often declarer will play you for all high cards as well.  Can be a double edged sword|pg||
nt|kit: so we have first real swing of this set|pg||
nt|3for3: New leader now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|robinswr: but if it went 1club - 1heart double 4hearts would they bid 4spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did at the other table|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: When auction calls for trump lead in first place, I don't think you are giving away much info|pg||
mc|9|nt|me argent: but for how long?|pg||

mb|2H|an|good 2!h bid|mb|p|nt|jlall: so his bidding combined with his play won him that swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: NS appear to play strong 2s|pg||
nt|jlall: ;)|pg||
nt|jlall: 9-12 I'm told, with 2@D weak multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yep :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: they play multi for the weaker weak-twos|pg||
nt|passell: have noticed Fleisher seems to bid more with bad hands than good  through out the match|pg||
nt|jlall: greco doubling here because he's worried about just having a vul game on power, hampson could easily have 11-13 with 3 hearts also|pg||
nt|passell: this looks like a winning action though|pg||
nt|jlall: and it might be good just to compete for the partial if partner has a long suit and a weakish hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: It is only the very unfriendly lie of the cards that might defeat 4H|pg||
nt|jlall: fleisher did very well to reopen here|pg||
nt|passell: got 500 here though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|passell: uglier for Greco anywhere else|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this will not end well|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: you're rather have the ace of spades in with the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: greco thought if his partner had a little heart help, 2N might be better|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder of fleisher knows what to lead|pg||
nt|jlall: it looks stupid for greco to run but it sounded like kamil had more spades and less HCP, then running might have been successful|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess 4th best works|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|c5|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s5|nt|jlall: this is a good line, let them run hearts before you've played anything, relieves the pressure from you a bit|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i got one defense right -- will stick to bidding now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: :)|pg||
nt|passell: not leading the K of diamonds off the dummy was his demise|pg||
nt|algraves: majors obviously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby not downgrading the hand - 1@C opened because playing weak nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: since stansby plays 12-13 he opens 1club with 15|pg||

nt|me argent: pass?  thats a suprise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i think we covered THAT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = @H & @S|pg||
nt|3for3: South was able to show a GOOD 2@H bid in other room.  Here, the opening will drive NS into game|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H might not make with everything offside|pg||
nt|me argent: EW playing 2@SX in OR|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2clubs shows both majors (good to play some convention in this situation |pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: good contract that should be down on @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: like cappelletti|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT gets killed on spade lead, but that is unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: I play a similar style and have had very good results with it.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: Speaking of bidding, I really think intermediate jump overcalls are great when vulnerable. I Weinstein were using them he had one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@C was inv+ spades|pg||
nt|me argent: now it should make|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S in Open lost battle but won war.     Would you bid with South after 2S P P ?|pg||
nt|me argent: that is if declarer draws trumps and claims:)|pg||
nt|me argent: 100%|pg||
nt|me argent: NS need to make this to hold thir losses to single digits|pg||
nt|kit: I would have led a diamond with the East hand, hoping for Jxxxx in partner's hand|pg||
nt|me argent: grco in OR has run to the safetyof 2nt doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gitelman: Low card lead means you don't like other suits?..Stansby: It's combination|pg||
nt|3for3: Both halves play NT on same board, not usually a good idea (especially if it is not 1NT)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: meckwell use the but only when vul vs not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show shape as if RHO opened   just don't need points since PARTNER bid first|pg||
nt|robinswr: but double should be penalties|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|algraves: so your routine 18 pt game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein says:  this is a catch-up hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clock shows 56 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence's Overcalls [at least in 1st edition]  had 3 treatments for jump overcalls depending upon vul|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: but he will have to play it well|pg||
nt|kjadams: Seems all the Kibs would bid with South hand after 2S P P.   Fleisher did not bid.   No clue what is right!|pg||
nt|me argent: east wasnt looking for a @S ruff with his @C holding what he didnt know was he needed a @S trick as many spectators have pointed out he could have couvered all possabilities by ...|pg||
nt|me argent: leading @HK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: of course -- thanks for qualifying that Steve|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|algraves: Kamil couldnt read the singleton|pg||
nt|algraves: so 2@H make 2 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|robinswr: i like leading 3rd best from AKQ. when my queen holds i can play suit preferance with the ace or king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW Reg Smith|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|s4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|me argent: even making 3nt wont prevent a double digit loss for @D team|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a good result for N-S as 4@H might not make, but with E-W playing 2@S doubledin other room, it might not be so good.|pg||
nt|3for3: 2NT doubled|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 2NT doubled|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: New edition came out this year but I haven't read it :(|pg||
nt|passell: good to steal this one  Playing such a limited system another dbl might have been called for  since he really didnt show extras the 1st time  just shape|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 5 down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfd: table taking a short break|pg||
nt|chorush: In fact an intermediate jump overcall would work badly here as the opponents can make 3 diamonds and Diamond would double back in|pg||
nt|passell: can make a lot of diamonds|pg||

nt|jlall: although one thing ive learned playing against kamil is that he always has a good hand|pg||
nt|passell: partner could easily have a good bal hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on board 22   Moss in West took Mike's approach and bid 1N -- now in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong -- Moss bid 2@C [garbage stayman]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bobby: Certainly understand your problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: declarer doesnt know its a singelton so might well go wrong|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|algraves: well done by NS |pg||
nt|robinswr: when you're playing a forcing club you can open lighter|pg||
nt|algraves: NS make 3 @D|pg||
nt|kit: not 8 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: he who opens the bidding has an advantage (like the serve in tennis)|pg||
nt|algraves: that would show both minors I  assume|pg||
nt|me argent: good OR result for fleisher|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: EW 3@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe 2spades shows two spades :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the advanced version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Too practical|pg||
nt|algraves: since 1@D precision could be 2@D and more clubs, they  have a lot of comp bids that show both minors so opener can choose|pg||
pc|d6|nt|passell: great spot needs only 3-2 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: South won the points on the last board by balancing with s X after his weak 2 opener- an unusual bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sry now 7|pg||
nt|kit: Passing on South hand with 5-card spade suit would not be a popular choice, but it may well be right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: think platnik could have made a try|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D promises at least 1 4M   3@H=4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you are playing a forcing club you're forced to open 1 grunt (diamond) on balanced hands|pg||
nt|kit: after all, 7 tricks are 1 less than 8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|passell: found the killing heart lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 4@H retransfer|pg||
nt|algraves: so again here EW get a spade contract stolen by light actions|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|me argent: im a 2@S bidder myself|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: guessing   Levin PASS says no @H stop|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is a 9-9 (both sides have 9-card fits) hand so ew violated the law|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|robinswr: by opening that trash hamson stole the hand|pg||
nt|algraves: You are just not used to having 19 pts on this auction ,opening bid and limit raise in minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein pushed to 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves: so each of NS thought the other was lighter and pulled in  a bit because of vulenrability|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: yes, he is saying the contract is better played by Weinstein|pg||
nt|passell: shows a hand he has nothing in hearts he wants lead up to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Weinstein had choice of bidding 4@S or RDBL to retransfer again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: he might do it with AX in hearts in case partner had the queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Mike wouldn't have one of those options -- having discarded his Blue card|pg||
nt|passell: true|pg||
nt|chorush: For those of you who are not familiar with it, 3C asked for 5 card minor; 3D said no 5 card minor, 3H promised 4 spades, then Levin cue bid 4C|pg||
nt|chorush: major not minor|pg||
nt|passell: I dont mind having it  just hate my opponents to have it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|algraves: NS are threatening 5 trricks before west can get nine|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|algraves: now he is home, well done|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|algraves: These aggressive limited openings can be effective when they find an early fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the only thing that hand had going for it was the vulnerability|pg||
nt|kit: Keep in mind that for spades to be superior to NT at IMPs, spades has to take 2 more tricks than NT|pg||
nt|3for3: I always transfer with 5, myself|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont|pg||
nt|kit: I think one should use judgment|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: one twist Ira -- their 3@D promises 4@H and/or 4@S  some  pairs [meckwell] say it just denies 5@H/@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|algraves: North is peering through the looking glass but no Alice|pg||
nt|algraves: the Chesire cat sits west|pg||
nt|3for3: It does enable you to back into your major with 4441 hands, and partner knows you don't have 5 of em|pg||
nt|me argent: im a 2 way stayman man myself transfers over 1nt too complicated|pg||

nt|passell: hard to pick against L-W  hottest pair on this side of Norway|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nobody plays natural systems like you do Steve|pg||
nt|passell: yes Steve still opens 1heart on 65432 of hearts and 8 solid clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|jlall: we know both pairs really want it, I feel like Greco-Hampson and Levin-Weinstein especially have been top pairs in the country for a really long time and not gotten a shot at a ...|pg||
nt|jlall: bermuda bowl/olympiad becuase Nickell kept winning |pg||
nt|chorush: well the fleisher team are certainly the relative naturalists vs the diamond scientists|pg||
nt|robinswr: can't wait for that hand to be dealt to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 7@c plays quite well here :)|pg||
nt|passell: 7 clubs is a good spot here interesting hand|pg||
nt|jlall: getting to clubs might be hard|pg||
nt|jlall: usually getting to the 4th suit can be difficult, ehre spades, hearts, and diamonds will be bid first|pg||
nt|jlall: but im sure they'll work it out|pg||
nt|passell: easier in standard  |pg||
nt|chorush: yes much easier in standard|pg||
nt|henryb:  and discovering that the @dQ is a better card than the @sQ may also be hard|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1heart 1sp 2cl 2di 3clu|pg||
nt|passell: especially with some of your aggressive partners who would bid 1h 1sp 3clubs|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson trying to remember the bids here maybe, they only recently switched to MAFIA stuff in these auctions (2@C=hearts)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Martel-Stansby in 7@c in the CR|pg||
nt|chorush: 1H-1S-3C likely to reach grand|pg||
nt|jlall: they got there after a 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|caitlin: no lead yet in CR|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|passell: yes had a natural auction with west showing a gf and raising clubs after they were rebid  |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: some really great bridge this quarter|pg||
nt|jlall: hampsons next bid will be 4@C|pg||
nt|caitlin: lead in CR a spade|pg||
nt|henryb:  Both teams are really playing quite well|pg||
nt|jlall: greco might be considering bidding 3@S to show his doubleton, but he'd prefer Qx of spades for that|pg||
nt|robinswr: greco has bid clubs 3 times maybe after the 4th club bid he'll get supported (isn't supporting clubs against the rules)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|passell: yes an occassional slip is only human especially in a long match against great opposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: this might turn hampson off|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: they may have problems with time... only have about 25 minutes left for this and 5 more boards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jlall: but he has a lot of extras, must bid 4@C|pg||
nt|passell: yes  even Justin when all else fails raises his partner|pg||
nt|jlall: only after exhausting all other options!|pg||
nt|henryb:  under proteat of course|pg||
nt|passell: ha ha|pg||
nt|chorush: but he usually needs 5 trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: so greco knows hampson is 553, probably with extras|pg||
mb|4D|an|RKC - !C|mb|p|nt|passell: time for someone to bring out blackwood|pg||
mb|5C|an|2 with the Queen|nt|jlall: 4@D RKC for clubs |pg||
nt|robinswr: 1spade showed a good positive|pg||
nt|jlall: 5@C 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|chorush: looks from the bidding that 4D was RKC|pg||
nt|henryb:  does he know 5-5-3, or could Hampson be 5=1=5=2 with @cQ and primes?|pg||
nt|jlall: i dont think hampson would raise with Qx|pg||
nt|passell: hampson will bid 7 over anything other than a signoff|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: i think over 5@D he will bid 5N showing the @DK|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Greco has no idea that @dQ is a good card|pg||
mb|5N|nt|chorush: he will when he reasks and gets the diamnd king|pg||
nt|passell: I expect 7clubs now|pg||
nt|jlall: now greco knows @DQ is gold|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he'll know 5nt shows the diamond king|pg||
nt|jlall: and can bid 7 |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  play should be faster than bidding, after long though before opening lead|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson to me has shown his whole hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually lead a trump against 7|pg||
nt|jlall: 5053 with SA, DAK, CQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: even opposite Qx 7 might make|pg||
nt|chorush: with trump lead playing for 7 club tricks and 6 top tricks is simplest, but is it best?|pg||
nt|henryb:  @sA, @dQ, @hAK,@dA|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes I would expect @C lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|jlall: greco knowing hampsons hand might not bid 7|pg||
nt|jlall: its not that great|pg||
nt|passell: he might think he is 5152 on the auction|pg||
nt|jlall: but hampson could have the @DJ|pg||
nt|passell: still might make it though|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: phew!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: very nice auction i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: nicely done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|robinswr: well done|pg||
nt|passell: very|pg||
nt|jlall: the way it timed out for them made it pretty hard to bid|pg||
nt|passell: there were a lot of potential swings this set score 14-13 is amazing|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't think in this match that they would take away boards|pg||
nt|chorush: and the 14 came on one board|pg||
nt|chorush: the other table is going almost as slowly. Lots of problems|pg||
nt|jlall: taking away boards at this stage of the event would be terrible, just let them play|pg||
nt|passell: and 10 the other way could easily have been avoided|pg||
nt|passell: could easily be 3-0|pg||
nt|robinswr: as long as they finish in time to go to New Orleans every thing will be OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I have a plane to catch tomorrow|pg||
nt|passell: he is trying to find a line that doesnt require 4-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, only the relatively unusal 2 bids that Fleisher uses created the 14 imp swing|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|passell: he doesnt know trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|jlall: if kamil has 2 diamonds, and hearts are 4-4 he would still make|pg||
nt|robinswr: in this case a spade lead might have been better|pg||
nt|passell: was lead at the other table  just made the oplay faster|pg||
nt|jlall: i dont see how he can cater to 4-4 hearts with fleisher having a doubleton diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: well a well earned partscore swing for Diamond|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves: Greco is thinking that better spades would have been even more helpful|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt in my opinon was very vewry wet|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|4th suit|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: makes up for systemic loses from their nebulous @D opener prevening effective competition|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that was last set|pg||
mb|2C|nt|algraves: oh yes no free lunch in bridge|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is a bidders game|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually there was a free lunch between the 2nd and 3rd quarter|pg||
nt|algraves: well you have so many more bids in your box than passes you pretty much have to start bidding eventually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S raise guarantees 4  [support dbl situation]|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: something of a difference in evaluation|pg||
nt|me argent: another slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: agree.   Not that the 2D bid created worries where the other table was silent.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Not = Note  :-)|pg||
nt|me argent: true norths 1nt opening showed 13 15 points in this room and 15 17 points in other room but still south could have tried|pg||
nt|me argent: of course transfers must be played over 2NT and many analgous situations|pg||
mb|2D|an|4th suit|nt|algraves: in the other room south passed 2@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: since their 1diamond is limited they can make preemptive bids here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever run out of pass cards Allan?|pg||
nt|algraves: I am not sure Martel would bid normally with that hand., but he is probably getting a little tired of being pushed around|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss'  3N on 22  -200   |pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually 7 can be made with the @dK onside and the miracle diamond spots|pg||
nt|jilllevin: 3n might have been interested opp max but no more- 4c is st c no shortness|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|algraves: well that is an interesting lead, he is afraid that South has running diamonds for his bid as he knows he has spade fit|pg||
nt|algraves: not sure I mean|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree about the 2heart bid|pg||
nt|kit: Martel can now bid 4@C to set trumps, and then we will see what happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss also bid 2@H  but playing standard Weinstein could only bid 2@S and there it ended|pg||
nt|algraves: well they have all their assets working for them. and the suits break|pg||
nt|algraves: somehow EW have to get a force going on dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an effective lead as it establishes the @d trick before declarer can take a pitch|pg||
nt|robinswr: they have four top losers |pg||
nt|kjadams: possible Beer hand  (Diamond 7 takes last trick in 6H)|pg||
mb|4D|an|RKC|nt|algraves: no spade fit|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby knows his partner has a game force, and some support|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D perhaps RKC for clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=transfer  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Responder showed club invite, nothing about spades|pg||
nt|me argent: so far the different nt ranges have lead to @D team losing 18 imps on 2 bds this session|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: immediate 2@S would show 9-11 2@S but no other feature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thx JoAnna -- that is better than my just saying 2@H was trf|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess there wasn't much of a difference after all - you pass 2@s and you go down one, or you bid 3NT and you go down one|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C 2 with queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: well 2@S went one down|pg||
mb|5D|an|alerted|nt|kit: Now if he asks for specific kings and finds king of diamonds, can reasonably bid the grand|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: bds 67 and 69|pg||
mb|5N|an|DK|nt|algraves: East can ruff the third heart killing the pitch |pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  now it is cold|pg||
nt|robinswr: ew is going to have to play clubs soon in order to beat this|pg||
nt|kit: 5NT shows king of diamonds (5 of major would show king of that major)|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it could have been hand with 2@S and less than 9 points|pg||
nt|me argent: very suprising result from OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no. they can win the @s and play two clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Very well bid IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: good biddings|pg||
nt|me argent: only thing left to do is win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: And with things splitting should make -- 2 ruffs in dummy get him to 7 trump tricks, 3 diamonds, 2 hearts, 1 spade = 13|pg||
nt|me argent: on a @S lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss considering S lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|algraves: yes back to having tto force the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see that spade lead does any damage|pg||
nt|me argent: he is still cold but its more of a challenge|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|robinswr: now is the crucial play|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|dburn: sure - the defenders had three trump tricks and three aces|pg||

nt|algraves: 3NT , 2S all the same to these guys|pg||

nt|henryb:  big swing: 16 imps between beating and making|pg||
nt|algraves: are the diamonds really 3-2 he thinks?|pg||
nt|algraves: if they are they let me make an unmakeable game|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can lead the ace of diamonds and see if diamonds split|pg||
nt|robinswr: prabably can't make if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Steve said -- Stansby knew Martel had @CK -- wonder why not immediate low from @CAce|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is a good idea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Allan - i missed your covering that :(|pg||

mb|2H|nt|me argent: oui|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: another potential slam|pg||

nt|algraves: 3 down|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chorush: so fleisher plus at both tables most likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so after 4 pushes could be 4 straight pickups for Fleisher|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: it was the best he could do as opponents were going to make at least 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|me argent: 6@Ss good spot|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Gitelman was in 2@H for a while but now Moss playing 2N west|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he has to give up a trick|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jlall: greco is bidding blackwood with a void|pg||
nt|jlall: he can do this because his partner didnt cue diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chorush: yes, but he knows no diamond ace|pg||
nt|jlall: so he knows his partner doesnt have the diamond ace|pg||

nt|robinswr: good 6spades looking at the ew cards|pg||
nt|me argent: maybe he was afraid of overstating his high card values kit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Good 4 spade contract here for EW. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to say  over 1@S will be interesting if Diamond tries a Negative Free Bid 2@H  [if available in their partnership]|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: in the other room they bid 7 when east bid 5NT over the Q ask |pg||
nt|dburn: ...maybe Kamil could have done what they did at the other table, whcih was to bid 5NT over the ask for the queen of spades|pg||
nt|algraves: and they then bid onemore|pg||
nt|kit: I think he was more afraid of missing 3NT when it was only game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves: 2NT a limit raise in spades type hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still and all, at the other table they bid only three spades - at this one, East bid four|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does west look too strong for 2@S to anyone else?|pg||
nt|passell: when he wins dia gets uppercut|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes that is a good point , perhaps west passed to quickly|pg||
nt|me argent: the Great Shuffler has decided to give these boys another chance|pg||
nt|kit: Drury here I think|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted |nt|algraves: 4@H makes|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S down one with best defense|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it does, but at the moment the other side is trying for game|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby decided to treat his hand as a strong notrump|pg||
nt|algraves: yes lots of handling with the bad breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see 2@S can include what many call a strong NT opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not convinced he treated it as a strong NT as much as he doesn't have any rebid problems|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play strong notrump vul in 3rd seat only|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreed, but there is no guarantee that rebidding 1@s is 15-17 right?|pg||
nt|algraves: really there is no way to make 6@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless he gets a club lead he'll go down in 6spades|pg||
nt|algraves: maybe double dummy |pg||
nt|algraves: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has to lose a heart and can't set up the clubs without drawing trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: X? whatever that means?|pg||
nt|me argent: by south|pg||
nt|me argent: or 3@Cs|pg||
nt|me argent: but that might be GF|pg||
mb|3H|an|natural, slam try|nt|robinswr: 2spades showed values for a strong notrump|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby can just about bid the slam himself if he knows his partner has good spades -- will be at worst on heart finesse from his point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  or 2N?|pg||
nt|me argent: how does south express his hand?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|robinswr: they probably can raise on 3 so 2nt asks if he has four spades |pg||
nt|robinswr: 4clubs shows four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: A lot of spots this hand.   with good guessing, can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|me argent: looks like this is noy a discussed auction by NS|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a big if in there, especially since he doesn't know his partner has FOUR spades.|pg||
nt|3for3: Two way drury might have helped with that, of course|pg||
nt|kit: right -- would have been good hand for 2-way Drury, where 2@D shows 4|pg||
nt|me argent: exactly danny|pg||
nt|3for3: I recall Hampson doesn't like 2way either...|pg||
nt|me argent: no hand is good for 2 way drury kit|pg||
nt|kit: It is going to be difficult for Martel to get excited about his junky collection, so Stansby will have to do a lot himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3H explained Natural/slam try|pg||
nt|me argent: its a poopy convention|pg||
mb|4C|nt|me argent: KOSCH where are you?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and maybe balance hand?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: they made this at the other table?|pg||

nt|robinswr: 0-3 keycards|pg||
nt|algraves: it would be surprising if this wasnt a push, down 1 at both tables|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you're unclear whether it's 0 or 3 bid 5spades. partner passes with 0 bids with 3 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel should bid 4@H here -- the king of hearts may be what Stansby needs (as it is)|pg||
nt|3for3: Why, Joey?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|algraves: yes sounds like zero key cards to me|pg||
nt|algraves: well he will like dummy for awhile|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is not the lead clubs against slam deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wouldn't that give him the worlds worse 11 count?|pg||
nt|me argent: it tells the opponents too much|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|passell: equal vulnerability it seems like a good bid|pg||
nt|passell: normal weak 2 bid  hands fit well|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems normal to guess diamonds wrong to keep west off lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|algraves: but gradually he will become disgruntled|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he was a bit better than Weinstein might have expected but it is the interior cards of his hand that make 4 spades worthwhile. That spade 10 and club 109 are vital|pg||
nt|3for3: If Martel had appreciated and shown his @H King, things would be different|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|nt|algraves: at the Bridge Gods|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S -100 is much better score than 6@C -100|pg||
nt|me argent: and is not necessary|pg||
mc|12|nt|robinswr: here its obvious that he has 3 there are some hands where its not obvious|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: yes he really did win trick one with the ace of clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HK useless  so  2N probably gets more credit than 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room -- very different auctions|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 aces and 3rd seat = upgrade to 2N opener|pg||
nt|kit: After running 4 diamonds, Gitelman will have to find club shift|pg||
nt|me argent: seems to me if lew disliked his hand so much it might have been better to for go drury on his junkpile and raise partner directly to 2@Ss|pg||
nt|3for3: On 87, Grampson will open a big @C, and responder has a +, so slam is very likely there|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: doesn't @CK mean down 2?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|chorush: although this defense is gong to pinpoint the KQ of clubs in Levins hand, the practical effect might be to enable declarer to go set 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college days, that [down 1] was definition of good bridge  |pg||
nt|passell: yes winning the club K might have worked  |pg||
nt|chorush: Levin is likely to play the spade J if trumps are led from south|pg||
nt|passell: it would have shown up later anyway though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin leans back in his chair to consider the position here|pg||
nt|passell: a diamond now and a club back would lead to an interesting end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anybody know if Weinstein ever opens 3rd seat 1@H with only 4? |pg||
nt|passell: if Steve had the KJ of dia instead of the ace and declare had 4 clubs it would be neccessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably unlikely with Platnick 4@S call regardless|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 very likely result from here|pg||

nt|robinswr: don't know what i would do and thats why opponents preempt|pg||
nt|algraves: well NS cant make much|pg||
nt|kjadams: :-) Exactly!|pg||
nt|me argent: that was scary says platnik|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bobby: u had Clubs if I pitch a S|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the more they preempt the more guesses you have to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  was wondering if that would be 3@S bid [asking for @S stop]|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|algraves: maybe that induced the spade misguess|pg||
nt|algraves: so 6NT a good contract |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really?|pg||
nt|algraves: as it has 12 top tricks |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like 2spades - 3spades as michaels|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: that way you can play 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just weaker than leaping michaels?|pg||
nt|algraves: 3 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C|pg||
nt|algraves: and 2@D|pg||
nt|algraves: no finesses, no breaks required|pg||
nt|algraves: bon pa bon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21  @D suit worth AT least one more point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, wasn't counting on 4@s|pg||
nt|robinswr: since stansby will not find an 8-card fit, he'll be conservative|pg||
mb|1H|nt|passell: that was down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will correct it, thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: if the play went as shown|pg||
nt|passell: 2clubs 2 dia 1 heart if reported correctly|pg||
nt|algraves: so a good play from that regard|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|me argent: maybe i am old fashioned but that south hand is not my idea of a 13 15 nt|pg||
nt|kjadams: Brian gets a breather here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: ty, adjusted now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, players have 200 on their score cards|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|passell: nice defense|pg||
nt|chorush: tough to know to lead the suit you bid with this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: n-s lead 4th best|pg||
nt|algraves: well you can if you like because after you lose to the Q all of yours are high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||
nt|kjadams: me either.   the big flaw for me is the doubleton heart.   Partner might want to play 2H when we belong in Spades.|pg||
nt|me argent: but no harm no foul|pg||
mb|2S|an|artificial|mb|p|nt|passell: he will have a chance to shift unless declarer sneaks in a spade|pg||
nt|passell: will be impossible though|pg||
nt|robinswr: smolen|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3hearts shows five spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: allows opener to play the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: you don't play garbage stayman over 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: 4,5 honour count and huge suit. almost 2@C then 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: Some danger of getting too high here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|algraves: but you can only upgrade so much|pg||
nt|robinswr: pick a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 4@C now any 54(40)?   [where 4@D needed to show 4@S 6@H]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll bid 6diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i don't think stansby will pass this|pg||
nt|algraves: Stansby will pull this I bet|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT jump shows extras, but Stansby has his minimum|pg||
nt|me argent: suprised lew didnt bid 3@Ds over 2@DS|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S I'm not sure of -- some kind of artificial call|pg||
nt|kit: I think 3@D would show 4|pg||
nt|kit: they have some artificial methods here, but I don't know them all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: i would almost never have 4@Ds on this auction|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: if bidding correct -- on 27 where we talked about Levin overcall of 2@S -- Brad Moss bid 3@S   raised to game by Fred|pg||
nt|passell: the 1 problem with the nebulous dia it is hard to compete on hands like this|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|algraves: My first really good bet in a long time|pg||
nt|gambit: what should N lead?|pg||
nt|robinswr: looking at all the hands you can take them all|pg||
nt|algraves: well he should lead the unbid suit|pg||
nt|3for3: So with 4045, you open 1@D?|pg||
nt|me argent: playing many years with the KOACH does that to you|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves: it is simpler|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5nt is pick a slam|pg||
nt|algraves: see|pg||
nt|algraves: Dr Martel will count his tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: and lose a @S|pg||
nt|robinswr: that takes the entry out for 7 but he'ss play safe for 6 by setting up four spade tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: hampson wil falsecard|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed danny|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: Brad must have an inkling that this set is not going well but 3S seems really out there|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|passell: the set seems pretty tame  it is sort of his style|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5nt is pick a small slam|pg||
nt|3for3: I don't get that, you have no rebid problems with 1@C.  With 0445 I can see the point|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: segment 7 of 8 scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|passell: wow another slam on these randomly generated hands|pg||
nt|jlall: last board of the set...end with a bang|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jlall: moss-gitelman stopped in 6|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 3 clubs was bid not 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: 6 clubs in other room|pg||
nt|jlall: 2@S?|pg||
nt|chorush: no, I think it went 3C 4C|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: wonder what 3clubs means|pg||
nt|chorush: that seems unlikely unless they need a HUGE hand t bid 3C|pg||
nt|jlall: is this really the auction|pg||
nt|jlall: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: no, it was not, lol|pg||
nt|jlall: this one i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: apparently I saw something different than what actually happened :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: What wld 5@d be here?|pg||
nt|chorush: Adam Kaplan, our viewgraph operator's first mistake of the set|pg||
nt|jlall: if they play kickback south cannot bid 4@D|pg||
nt|passell: send us some of what you are smoking|pg||
nt|jlall: in that case he can bid 4N diamond cue and no heart control|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jlall: i think thats what happened|pg||
nt|jlall: good bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: nah, it's all for me, Mike.. muahahaha|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: This is the last board of this set... will be back at 3:45PM Central time for the 7th of 8 segments :)|pg||
nt|jlall: now kamil should try for 7|pg||
nt|robinswr: i detest cuebidding voids unless you've shown shortness |pg||
nt|poohbear: Thats in about one hour|pg||
nt|jlall: well if he has 5 spades and 5 clubs and no heart control (2+ hearts) hes known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: Kamil has to be thinking about 7 with all the aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: well this is not good, I might be here all through my lunch break :)|pg||
nt|jlall: he really has no other option but to drive to slam opposite no known heart control|pg||
nt|chorush: 7 clubs need a bit of good fortune; clubs 2-2 or spade J dropping|pg||
nt|robinswr: why can't he have 2diamonds and 1heart|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jlall: because with a stiff heart he would cuebid hearts?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: or 5224 with a very good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 4N is a @d cue according to Marty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jlall: the main message of 4N is "I have no heart control but a strong enough hand to try for slam"|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jlall: i think kamil should have tried but he hated his bad trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jlall: this is the type of hand where you start cuebidding and then get to slam off a trump honor|pg||
nt|jlall: grand*|pg||
pc|cK|nt|passell: when you have 3 bullets you must try in my opinion|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah i agree|pg||
nt|jlall: sometimes partner just has solid blacks, as here|pg||
nt|chorush: is there a case for Marty kicking it in once pard jumps to 6 with no club higher thanthe 10?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|passell: partner could have spade J|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|robinswr: if partner's making a slam try off three aces he must have good black cards|pg||
nt|passell: see you later  be ready for some hard ball tonight|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board for the day    4 15-board sets tomorrow to determine USA1 for 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3rd of 8  15-board segments scheduled to begin in about 1 hour 15 minues|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 determined by 2011 Trials|pg||
nt|me argent: EW finally gets a turn with the bidding boxes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Levin may pass a double with Ax|pg||
nt|passell: yes then he might try to cash diamonds for pitches in clubs and have the 3rd 1 ruffed|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson is enjoying this|pg||
nt|robinswr: 10:00 cst |pg||
nt|kit: When South bids and rebid clubs, North can take over with RKC and bid the grand I think|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|robinswr: see what preempts get you|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs great spot|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|algraves: so this is 17-18|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final set of the day [but 60 boards tomorrow] sheduled to begin in 20 min|pg||
nt|kit: North might temporarize with 3@H|pg||
nt|me argent: dont see why|pg||
nt|me argent: set trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C certainly reasonable also, although oddly enough it may now be more difficult to get to the grand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robinswr: easy to find diamond fit if no preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room bidding not over -- currently at 7@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|Vugraphzfd: redouble explained as wants partner to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Diamond finally got off the set 'schneid'|pg||
nt|passell: I am always happy when Bobby is dummy no matter who he is playing with|pg||
nt|chorush: I wonder how redbl differs from P. Maybe better hand?|pg||
nt|passell: rdbl shows ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play   PASS when Texas doubled says "interest in competing"|pg||
nt|passell: great match between 2 great teams  the US will be well represented either way|pg||
nt|algraves: well they got pre emptedout of good 6 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: this will make 5|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt also makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: yes good 9 of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: now this 5@C call is very poor -- his hand is much too strong for that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: winner of this match will be USA1 in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|hA|nt|me argent: the curse of scotland assures the making of 3nt vs any def|pg||
nt|passell: makes it safe to play on hearts|pg||
nt|kit: everybody asks what I would suggest instead of 5@C.  My answer is:  Anything but 5@C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: with 3 aces north might have done more also|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: USA2 will be determined by the 2011 Trials|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he took the straight forward approach saved an undertrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2010 world championship events in Philadelphia are NOT country-specific|pg||
nt|passell: need ax or stiff Q onside|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: JoAnna -- thanks for the great work   and please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|algraves: thanks to Johanna |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@D it is|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Allan -- the NT ranges all move up 1 point  3rd seat vul and 4th seat|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he didn't want to cue his void in partner's suit.  Perhaps 5@C showed good trumps.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: 5@C is his weakest bid -- anything else would show he had some extra strength.  Doesn't matter what he Q-bids, but he must Q-bid something|pg||
pc|h7|nt|me argent: safety 1st|pg||
pc|c4|nt|me argent: 3@Cs did show a big hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: why was that a safety play?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|nt|algraves: oops Moss and Gitelman in 7@D|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|me argent: didnt think much about the hand mike just figured if levin played the hand that way he must be right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|robinswr: on previous hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|3for3: See you for the next set....thanks all|pg||
