mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|flash: Nickell rally in last segment (46-8) fell short|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to George Mittelman|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|flash: final was 244 - 231|pg||
nt|algraves: 12 great players , 6 great pairs, this will be an excellent 120 board match. All are very hungry since usually to play for USA you have to go through Nickellville which is a pretty ...|pg||
nt|algraves: rough town|pg||
nt|flash: 8 segments of 15 boards each; 4 today and 4 tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|algraves: however, Fleisher beat them in semis. so now the winner of this is off to the Bermuda Bowl next year as usa 1|pg||
nt|algraves: West going slamming first board. |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|bigtrain: 4@S looks to  be RKC|pg||

nt|passell: trump lead here is killer|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Mike Passell|pg||
nt|algraves: it has some play|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the translation of "some play" means not 2 fast osers  :)|pg||
nt|algraves: @S A onside and @C 3-3 is helpful|pg||
nt|bigtrain: losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves: yes , not down on the go = " some play"|pg||
nt|algraves: good lead by North|pg||
nt|algraves: he knows the opps are light in High cards so trump lead may be needed, and he doesnt really want to start any other suit, so a touch of passivity as well|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard to see where 12 tricks are going to come from|pg||
nt|algraves: he will be able to come in and play a second trump as well on some variations so it is hard to see where 12 tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|flash: to update our report of the mix-up in the European Championships yesterday, Sweden and England were allowed to replay their match today|pg||
nt|flash: Sweden took a 17-13 decision in Round 9X|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: well he wasnt down 5 but he was certainly down|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|algraves: so a touchdown, convert and 2 safeties on first hand for Fleisher|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H is a random positive -- 8 to 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: our operator for this segment is Bryan Delfs|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|algraves: Hamson Greco play the hyper aggressive precision style that is all the rage |pg||
nt|bigtrain: the rest of the auction should be fairly natural from here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|algraves: so very geneerally the big club systems consider limiting hands more important first step than naming suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|algraves: Natural systems more to naming suits first then limiting hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|algraves: neither method works perfectly so you pick a style and enjoy it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think 2N showed a 3fit in some 4432|pg||
nt|algraves: So E will think he has some work to do, but the friendly clubs will allow all rational lines to suceed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes, 3NT would be more comfortable but either game should make eventually|pg||
nt|algraves: Natural would go 1@H  2@H  4@H|pg||
nt|flash: possibly, as in the Closed Room, East would value the hand as worth a Drury call|pg||
nt|kit: unlucky system quirk has the weak hand declaring -- fortunately, only an overtrick at most is at stake|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|flash: and an overtrick IMP to Fleisher (as Kit mentioned, playing it from West was advantageous)|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S down 1 or 2 with minor suit lead|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is the winning spot here, but it will be hard to negotiate that|pg||
nt|flash: an 'upgrade' |pg||
nt|bigtrain: not sure that hand qualifies as a good 14|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR says 12.70|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@H a make|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps NV he liked the tactical advantage of pre empting with 1NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|algraves: maybe 4@H hard to play with @S lead|pg||
nt|kit: however, 3NT goes down on jack of diamonds lead -- finable only if East overcalls (which he probably will)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR is a hand evaluation program that helps to assess the specific adjusted value of a hand |pg||
nt|algraves: Seems very hard to bid to 3NT single dummy|pg||
nt|algraves: Double dummy means you see ALL the cards. |pg||
nt|algraves: single dummy just your own miserable 13|pg||
nt|kit: likely Levin will transfer -- whether to 2 or 4-level will depend on their methods|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|5D|nt|algraves: so we do well to remember that the players are playing single dummy|pg||
nt|algraves: this is one down with the winning @D view|pg||
nt|kit: unlucky decision to bid 5@D, but admittedly it could be right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|flash: this is not a forcing pass situation, since N-S are not vulnerable?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Levin should certainly double|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves: yes it is hard to pass when you could be cold for game or push them up or even a 1 down save|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|kit: even if it were a forcing pass situation, South's pass looks right with no diamond wastage and spade support|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will have to choice but to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|algraves: Forcing pass means that , " we both know it is our hand so they wont play this undoubled. I am interested in going on if you are, so you decide|pg||
nt|algraves: double by South is a definite opinion about bidding on|pg||
nt|flash: and, just to complicate a situation which already leads to significant mix-ups, the latest style is PDI|pg||
nt|flash: Pass-Double Interchange, which reverses the meanings|pg||
nt|algraves: The issue is the first part, " We both know it is our hard in high cards and defense so we can utilize this agreement )|pg||
nt|algraves: This is where the mix ups occur. |pg||
nt|algraves: Kit has written some good articles on forcing pass situations if you want to bone up|pg||
nt|kit: Since the 4-level transfer could be quite weak, I don't see why a force should be created here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|algraves: it is an invaluable tool for competitive bidding but requires some work and discussion with partner|pg||
pc|s8|nt|algraves: so that is a good point.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|algraves: I dont either|pg||
nt|flash: East's choice of card, when playing to trick one, isn't trivial|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein worked out that his heart tricks couldn't be going anywhere -- declarer does have to have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bigtrain: whenever one partner just bids game (via transfer or othewise) it should not constitute a forcing pass situation...  FP should cover hands where a low level game force has already ...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: been established (and maybe a few closely defined exceptions)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|algraves: So while we wait , this was not a forcing pass situation becuase there is no guarantee that it is our hand defensively|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Although perhaps he should have cashed the second heart.  What if declarer's hand is: --, Jx, AKxxxxxx, AJx -- then he might get squeeze-endplayed if he doesn't cash second heart.|pg||
nt|algraves: no reason to think East cannot make 5@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|algraves: QT dblt in opener ? or Ten doublton in opener|pg||
nt|algraves: is his decision|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 10 doubleton twice as likely|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like Levin should cover -- he knows declarer has AK of diamonds, but could his partner have 10xx?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|kit: However, if declarer plays for Q10 doubleton, his duck will have gained|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|passell: yes but could be a double game swing|pg||
nt|passell: I confess I would have bid also|pg||
nt|henryb:  or, as here, a double phantom swing|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|passell: its why we all love this game|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer can hold it to down 1 by guessing trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it appears to have no cost to do so|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|passell: he probably will  running the J only loses if south has the Q 10 doublrton|pg||
nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|henryb:  he just did. guess trump that is|pg||
nt|passell: that is hard to understand|pg||
nt|stewball: cant see any rational for this|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: so they are slamming here, 3NT encouraging slam try|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|flash: 4@S RKCB for @Hs?|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is a pretty fair slam , lots of chances in 6@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was just thinking that it;s a borderline slam...  hard to figure out exactly how good|pg||
nt|flash: but, if it were, we'd expect a faster bid from Levin?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S showed 5+ @S|pg||
nt|algraves: as NS play flannery|pg||
nt|bigtrain: as they play F******y|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S is probably RKC|pg||
nt|algraves: ie 2@D opener = 11-15 4 @S and 5@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually by agreement i think it's 5+@H allan|pg||
nt|algraves: so responder can skip over spades with 4 and opener can revers into spades with 16 plus|pg||
nt|mildredb: if it is ckbk, why hasn't Levin responded?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: good point Mildred, so maybe it is just  Q-bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: It is not a sleeping vugraph op, I'll tell you that|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kit: Well, that is the right response to RKC, so we still don't know|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bigtrain: caffine wired are we?  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Bids are starting to fall off the board|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: seems unlikely that 5@H call catered to North have 0 key cards (given the 3NT call), so we're a bit deep in their play book|pg||
nt|kit: One of them bid RKC, but not clear which one as auction is consistent with both|pg||
nt|algraves: There is a tray they slide back and forth under the screen that can only accomodate a certain number of bids. Like the human brain |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 4NT was blackwood|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Bryan|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Happy to clarify|pg||
nt|kit: I guess from the followup that 4@S was a Q, and 4NT was RKC, with 5@S showing all the keycards and asking for specific kings|pg||
nt|flash: so, the 4-level calls were all control bids|pg||
nt|algraves: for sure they know what all this means|pg||

nt|flash: (a direct 4@H call would be weaker)|pg||
nt|algraves: but sometimes it takes just a bit to get fully comfortable in a big match|pg||
nt|flash: US teams are notorious for detesting morning sessions...   |pg||
nt|flash: maybe there's good cause for that|pg||
nt|algraves: I see, well the only reall time is the present|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|kit: At the other table North wasn't selling to anything, so bid up to 6@H, and East wasn't brilliant enough to find the club lead so doubled slam make|pg||
nt|kit: Here the scientific 5@C call was doubled for the lead, so it looks like Diamond is going to win a lot of IMPs whatever happens|pg||
nt|flash: the Closed Room is playing at a pace consistent with the time limit; this room is 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|algraves: There is no free lunch in bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|algraves: every approach has plus and minus components|pg||

nt|algraves: the scientists want accuracy|pg||
nt|algraves: you pick your poison|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|6S|nt|kit: hard to imagine Levin isn't bidding 6@H now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|algraves: North didnt pick that hand up to be on defense|pg||
nt|kit: Neither did East|pg||
nt|algraves: well said|pg||
nt|flash: the vulnerability strongly suggested that East not risk defending?|pg||
nt|kit: Levin still thinking, but seems like enough is enough|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only 2 IMPs at risk... but he doesn't know that |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: so 16 to diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Going back to previous board -- what happened?  I think declarer decided that if the spade finesse was off his best chance was to set up the spades.  When it won, he failed to ...|pg||
nt|kit: readjust his trick count, and continued with that plan.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves: So without being critical was this a case of East taking insurance against a vulnerable @H slam?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c6|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: right.  If East knew for certain that 6@S was down then he probably shouldn't bid it, since 6@H might well be down and his partner knows more about the hand.|pg||

nt|me argent: who do i pay?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not really|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT depends outright on club finesse (or 6-3 spades).  5@C has chances if club finesse off, but also might go down if club finesse on.  So not obvious which is better.|pg||
nt|algraves: yes , not as clear as I made out on this hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've found most BAL 12 don't give much of a play for 3N opposite an agressive 1@D bid...  so we play 2N as 12+ to 13-|pg||
