mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands -- attacking @C would have let contract make - but i think playing @H gave better chance of going down ONLY 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and no reason @HKx couldn't be in west|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: another [ugly?] upgrade to 14|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: many pointing out  low @C [not cashing Ace] before @H finesse better -- works in actual case and @H finesse still available if @C not good|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lml: they will end in 4@S whatever north opened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: K&R  thinks north is worth all of 12.30    http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|lml: dies it count the nice 10's|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|lml: hi Allan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- K&R looks at 10s -- but really doesn't like Queens|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  I mean the team names. Both of you have them backward|pg||
nt|lml: well they go better with the 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in combination|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: they don't want to get too high here but I don't imagine they will|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S = safe but 5@S = not safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could be "Baze"  @S raise, unspecified shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 & 9 card suits have not been all that rare this week|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then 4@C=1@C  [3N would be some void]|pg||
nt|lml: whatever they are doing they doing have the tickets for a slam|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS using udca|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfd: as to the team names on the green vugraph bars:  yes the names are entered there reversed|pg||
nt|lml: 6 imps to Diamond when Greco-Hampson got a plus in a partscore on the previous deal|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco has to guess the trump jack|pg||
nt|lml: yes he does but Kamil was less likely to lead a singleton with good trump so I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein flew @HA then dropped @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: thats the easy way!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more info at other table where opening lead was dummy's suit.   Here Fleisher's non-double of 3@H lulled declarer into playing low|pg||

nt|robinswr: or the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

nt|gavin:  basically saying to partner (bid 3nt when you have 18-19 balanced)|pg||
nt|passell: players are realizing preemptive raises are losing action|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D & @H/@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|robinswr: the problem with DONT is that you don't know the lengths of the two suits|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chorush: dangerous spot for Levin to double but his side can make 2 or 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: a good disciplined pass I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: this should go down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: he cant get enough pitches for his hearts without the opposition ruffing|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is the killing lead and North will just play normally , pitch a heart and play spades. He has no reason not to expect 7 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is reluctant to duck first heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Weinstein needs an uppercut to get three trumps to go with three aces|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|chorush: look like diamond should start with the spade K|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1N=good 13-16    Martel's NT would be 12-14  will he open 1N or 1@D? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think just coincidence that 2@D bid corresponds to DONT    actually 2minor = minor + unknown major|pg||
nt|robinswr: same principle|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chorush: If I were Martel, I might think the trick taking potential of this hand is more than 14|pg||

nt|passell: yes  a good hand for michaels  especially being a passed hand|pg||

nt|3for3: south passed so as to play it from north's side|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  Maybe east was hoping his opponents would redouble and play it there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: rdbl by S = force partner to declare,    pass says:   interest in competing further|pg||
nt|3for3: that's a sore spot|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|flash: down 2 on a black-suit lead|pg||
nt|passell: the weak nt players would suffer on this one as the opponents would get in the auction|pg||
nt|gavin:  :) i bet he and his screenmate had a smile about it|pg||
nt|me argent: always a possability gavin or so i have heard|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman-Moss auction    1@C-3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even if north reads the trump -- would need west to follow to 3@C to ditch @H loser|pg||
mb|1N|nt|algraves: yes he played normally with hope for sucess if hearts were 7-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|robinswr: hampson has a balanced hand this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a pinochle|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby will double showing diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: Having talked a lot with Steve at this tournament, I know that he is a strong proponent of leaving doubles like this one in. It is not the major disaster that 2 of a major would ...|pg||
nt|chorush: be, but a possible adverse swing of 7 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: five+ diamonds and he hopes to bid spades next|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lml: or the @S9 was onside|pg||
nt|algraves: so the big clubbers get to practice their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, any shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2spades probably shows a doubleton spade and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby could have bid 2hearts (Michaels) but he wanted to get his lead director in|pg||
nt|algraves: hello again bridge fans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome canada|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2spades might have been hampsons only superaccept if 2diamonds didn't promise hearts and was a 2-way convention|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|algraves: so NS can make 2H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this auction protects against immediate @D attack -- but there is plenty of time|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think that when greco declines the invitation, stansby should bid his spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|algraves: EW a lot of spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin opened 1N as good 14-17, Weinstein Texas transfers into 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: his partner is marked for values if the opponents don't get to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled and again  North becomes declarer  and both lead @CJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chorush: slightly conservative rebid and NS will miss the aggressive 4 heart contract that would make on a good day|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: 6@H wouldnt be bad if Hampson just had the @CK instead of the queen|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|lml: they might make it on this layout depending on the lead|pg||
nt|algraves: meanwhile they can make at 5 @H from south , 4@S from north|pg||
nt|lml: without a diamond lead they can discard diamonds on spades and go about setting up clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is true|pg||
nt|algraves: but they really dont have the stuff to bid too much higher|pg||
nt|lml: no they shouldnt be there for sure|pg||
nt|lml: its just that if they get carried away in the auction they may luck out|pg||
nt|algraves: they might crawl up to 5 but that seems pushy|pg||
nt|algraves: we dont know what there bids mean in any depth, but they do undoubtedly . so all we can do is wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe JoAnna will learn if   a) 1N limits hand beyond 8-11 bal  b) 3@C agree @H|pg||
nt|lml: the thing is that from Greco's point of view 8-11 is enough if its the right cards|pg||
nt|lml: the @CK alone would make it decent add the a major jack and even better|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|algraves: well he needs some key jacks to make it a good slam|pg||
nt|algraves: and the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: South passed initially and would have opened 1@D with bal 11 so South is limited|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher can kill the whole thing if he leads the @DA if they do get to slam since the @Ck has to score|pg||
nt|algraves: JXX, KJXX, AXX  XXX is a good 6 hearts basically needing 3-2 trump|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|algraves: whatever 4@S was Hampson had had enough|pg||
nt|lml: he knew they could safely play in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key for me will be explanation of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: North alerted 4@S,    and South did not alert 4@S     earlier bidding showed exactly 3@S4@H in south|pg||
nt|robinswr: but no redouble|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aha   thanks JoAnna|pg||
nt|algraves: so they had a key card misunderstanding here , Where is Eddie Kantar when they need him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it seems that 3@C was part of the pattern showing to describe 3-4 majors|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|algraves: but they come out ok|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfd: table taking a short break|pg||
nt|chorush: In fact an intermediate jump overcall would work badly here as the opponents can make 3 diamonds and Diamond would double back in|pg||
nt|passell: can make a lot of diamonds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on board 22   Moss in West took Mike's approach and bid 1N -- now in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong -- Moss bid 2@C [garbage stayman]|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|algraves: well done by NS |pg||
nt|robinswr: when you're playing a forcing club you can open lighter|pg||
nt|algraves: NS make 3 @D|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|robinswr: he who opens the bidding has an advantage (like the serve in tennis)|pg||
nt|algraves: that would show both minors I  assume|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves: EW 3@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe 2spades shows two spades :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the advanced version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Too practical|pg||
nt|algraves: since 1@D precision could be 2@D and more clubs, they  have a lot of comp bids that show both minors so opener can choose|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|robinswr: by opening that trash hamson stole the hand|pg||
nt|algraves: You are just not used to having 19 pts on this auction ,opening bid and limit raise in minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein pushed to 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves: so each of NS thought the other was lighter and pulled in  a bit because of vulenrability|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chorush: yes, he is saying the contract is better played by Weinstein|pg||
nt|passell: shows a hand he has nothing in hearts he wants lead up to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Weinstein had choice of bidding 4@S or RDBL to retransfer again|pg||
pc|d6|nt|passell: he might do it with AX in hearts in case partner had the queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Mike wouldn't have one of those options -- having discarded his Blue card|pg||
nt|passell: true|pg||
nt|chorush: For those of you who are not familiar with it, 3C asked for 5 card minor; 3D said no 5 card minor, 3H promised 4 spades, then Levin cue bid 4C|pg||
nt|chorush: major not minor|pg||

nt|robinswr: this is a bidders game|pg||

nt|algraves: well you have so many more bids in your box than passes you pretty much have to start bidding eventually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S raise guarantees 4  [support dbl situation]|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: something of a difference in evaluation|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: in the other room south passed 2@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: since their 1diamond is limited they can make preemptive bids here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever run out of pass cards Allan?|pg||
nt|algraves: I am not sure Martel would bid normally with that hand., but he is probably getting a little tired of being pushed around|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Moss'  3N on 22  -200   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: well that is an interesting lead, he is afraid that South has running diamonds for his bid as he knows he has spade fit|pg||
nt|algraves: not sure I mean|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree about the 2heart bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Moss also bid 2@H  but playing standard Weinstein could only bid 2@S and there it ended|pg||
nt|algraves: well they have all their assets working for them. and the suits break|pg||
nt|algraves: somehow EW have to get a force going on dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an effective lead as it establishes the @d trick before declarer can take a pitch|pg||
nt|robinswr: they have four top losers |pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves: no spade fit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=transfer  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Responder showed club invite, nothing about spades|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2@S would show 9-11 2@S but no other feature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thx JoAnna -- that is better than my just saying 2@H was trf|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess there wasn't much of a difference after all - you pass 2@s and you go down one, or you bid 3NT and you go down one|pg||

nt|algraves: are the diamonds really 3-2 he thinks?|pg||
nt|algraves: if they are they let me make an unmakeable game|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can lead the ace of diamonds and see if diamonds split|pg||
nt|robinswr: prabably can't make if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Steve said -- Stansby knew Martel had @CK -- wonder why not immediate low from @CAce|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is a good idea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Allan - i missed your covering that :(|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: agreed, but there is no guarantee that rebidding 1@s is 15-17 right?|pg||
nt|algraves: really there is no way to make 6@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless he gets a club lead he'll go down in 6spades|pg||
nt|algraves: maybe double dummy |pg||
nt|algraves: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has to lose a heart and can't set up the clubs without drawing trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|robinswr: 2spades showed values for a strong notrump|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|robinswr: they probably can raise on 3 so 2nt asks if he has four spades |pg||
nt|robinswr: 4clubs shows four spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and maybe balance hand?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dburn: they made this at the other table?|pg||
nt|algraves: well west judged to lead the Ace of @C|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0-3 keycards|pg||
nt|algraves: it would be surprising if this wasnt a push, down 1 at both tables|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you're unclear whether it's 0 or 3 bid 5spades. partner passes with 0 bids with 3 |pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: yes sounds like zero key cards to me|pg||
nt|algraves: well he will like dummy for awhile|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is not the lead clubs against slam deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wouldn't that give him the worlds worse 11 count?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|passell: equal vulnerability it seems like a good bid|pg||
nt|passell: normal weak 2 bid  hands fit well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves: but gradually he will become disgruntled|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|chorush: I think he was a bit better than Weinstein might have expected but it is the interior cards of his hand that make 4 spades worthwhile. That spade 10 and club 109 are vital|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|algraves: at the Bridge Gods|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 6@S -100 is much better score than 6@C -100|pg||
pc|s6|nt|robinswr: here its obvious that he has 3 there are some hands where its not obvious|pg||
nt|algraves: and then realize it is surely a push|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|robinswr: you hope its a push. sometimes opponents miss good slams  that go down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's some UNDO JoAnna |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes he really did win trick one with the ace of clubs|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 4diamonds would show 5-5 or more in the red suits|pg||
nt|robinswr: hampson can be saving or bidding to make greco has to guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N  LR in @S [i bet]|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: wow that is a lot to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, and he will duly go set at least one|pg||
nt|passell: Levin did well not to lead the K of clubs it would have given away the club suit and the whole hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK useless  so  2N probably gets more credit than 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room -- very different auctions|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: this is friendly for NS|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, after the king of club lead declared might wellguess both the diamond and spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes up for last hand being friendly for NS   [sarcasm]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he's going to be happy at the location of the trumps|pg||
nt|algraves: yes and the diamond offside so no slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|passell: a game try seems to be in order|pg||
nt|algraves: smooth duck by Fleisher , Hampson has good feel in those situations|pg||
nt|algraves: kamil is thinking he could tap dummy and guaranette trump tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: trick|pg||
nt|algraves: regardless he has no losing option now after the spade misguess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: doesn't @CK mean down 2?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chorush: although this defense is gong to pinpoint the KQ of clubs in Levins hand, the practical effect might be to enable declarer to go set 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college days, that [down 1] was definition of good bridge  |pg||
nt|passell: yes winning the club K might have worked  |pg||
nt|chorush: Levin is likely to play the spade J if trumps are led from south|pg||
nt|passell: it would have shown up later anyway though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin leans back in his chair to consider the position here|pg||
nt|passell: a diamond now and a club back would lead to an interesting end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anybody know if Weinstein ever opens 3rd seat 1@H with only 4? |pg||
nt|passell: if Steve had the KJ of dia instead of the ace and declare had 4 clubs it would be neccessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably unlikely with Platnick 4@S call regardless|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 very likely result from here|pg||
nt|chorush: Im certain he does although more and more people are using a jump to 3 here as mixed instead of preemptive. Don't know if Levin and Weinstein are part of that group|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|robinswr: you're more likely in this situation to have two suits and not know which to play in then have one suit and play good bad 4nt|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he had four hearts and diamonds, he could bid 4nt and correct clubs to diamonds showing the red suits |pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: maybe, but so does this - I think he's down two anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve would you bid North hand differently if exchange @DQ was @HQ [still 2623]|pg||
mc|11|nt|algraves: did he really win trick one with club ace?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|flash: thnx to Fred and the crew at BBO for giving us this great viewing platform|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: and to our commentators, for guiding us through the boards|pg||
nt|gavin:  3@H showed 5@S and 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gavin:  3NT said no fit, 4@C was natural|pg||
nt|3for3: if you could see all the cards....7nt can be made|pg||
nt|gavin:  moss decided spades would be  a reasonable place t play|pg||
nt|gavin:  4@D by moss would say he has a good hand for @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  because gitelman has highlighted his short @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  there wouldnt be any need for 4@D to be natural|pg||
nt|3for3: Ah, yes, the club lead would cut the transportation for an unlikely 7nt|pg||
nt|gavin:  club looks like his most likely lead|pg||
nt|gavin:  will not want to lead a @D through south |pg||
nt|gavin:  and leading from a major suit honor seems like a bad plan|pg||
nt|gavin:  though a spade lead is unlikely to cost (opponents seem like they are 2-5 )|pg||
nt|gavin:  wouldnt be suprised if fred drives to 7 of something given his high card strength|pg||
nt|ritong: he will certainly at least suggest grand|pg||
nt|flash: Martel-Stansby have settled in 6NT|pg||
nt|ritong: moss should decline, considering the dubious @d values|pg||
nt|gavin:  if he had the Jack of clubs he would really like to play in 7@C|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east |pg||
mb|7C|nt|gavin:  or if he knew his partner had KJx of @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: needs a @d lead now|pg||
nt|ritong: and some good guessing|pg||
nt|3for3: brad knows fred is 5404|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: both North and East start laughing when they see the tray come back 7@D|pg||
nt|gavin:  7@D is a scary bid|pg||
nt|ritong: "yourse pard"|pg||
nt|gavin:  looks like solid @D to me|pg||
nt|gavin:  if brad had AKQJxx of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: the tempo of the bid suggests "not solid" @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  this is how he bid|pg||
nt|gavin:  and then they definitely want to play in @D to ruff out the @S|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd think je might have bid @D's over 4@C, say 5@D with solid ones|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|flash: 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|me argent: this way they go down faster saving everyone alot of agony|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: agree with kibs:   entire auction by west says "not solid" for a number of reasons|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin:  still i think if brad wanted to play in either major, he could bid 7@H, he already chose @S earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: and none has anything to do with "tempo", imho|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|robinswr: the more they preempt the more guesses you have to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  was wondering if that would be 3@S bid [asking for @S stop]|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|algraves: maybe that induced the spade misguess|pg||
nt|algraves: so 6NT a good contract |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really?|pg||
nt|algraves: as it has 12 top tricks |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like 2spades - 3spades as michaels|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: that way you can play 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just weaker than leaping michaels?|pg||

nt|algraves: no finesses, no breaks required|pg||
nt|algraves: bon pa bon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21  @D suit worth AT least one more point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, wasn't counting on 4@s|pg||
nt|robinswr: since stansby will not find an 8-card fit, he'll be conservative|pg||
mb|3C|nt|passell: that was down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will correct it, thanks|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|passell: he will have a chance to shift unless declarer sneaks in a spade|pg||

nt|robinswr: smolen|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3hearts shows five spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: allows opener to play the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: you don't play garbage stayman over 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: 4,5 honour count and huge suit. almost 2@C then 2nt|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|algraves: but you can only upgrade so much|pg||
nt|robinswr: pick a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 4@C now any 54(40)?   [where 4@D needed to show 4@S 6@H]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll bid 6diamonds|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i don't think stansby will pass this|pg||
nt|algraves: Stansby will pull this I bet|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if bidding correct -- on 27 where we talked about Levin overcall of 2@S -- Brad Moss bid 3@S   raised to game by Fred|pg||
nt|passell: the 1 problem with the nebulous dia it is hard to compete on hands like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: My first really good bet in a long time|pg||
nt|gambit: what should N lead?|pg||
nt|robinswr: looking at all the hands you can take them all|pg||

pc|c5|nt|algraves: it is simpler|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5nt is pick a slam|pg||
nt|algraves: see|pg||
nt|algraves: Dr Martel will count his tricks|pg||
