mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzfk: welcome Ira :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: the response is routine at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: are you surprised Levin didnt bid 2hearts earlier?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chorush: NS are close to making 5D, EW maybe 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 5@d can make on the lie of the cards I believe -- ruffing @c finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this might get them to 5diamonds if Steve raises hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I am a little surprised he didnt bid 2 hearts. I wouldn't have been surprised to see the bidding box ome back to me with the oppents in 3 clubs|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: surprised Nick didnt bid 3clubs|pg||
nt|passell: the club spots allow 5 dia to make|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|warrens:  even on a spade lead, Mike?|pg||
nt|passell: as long as he plays a heart early|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein's subpar response probably helped keep the opponents low; I think I would have tried 3 clubs over 2 heaarts though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfk: I think so, but might be 1 trump short|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bbramley: hello everybody|pg||
nt|jlall: hi bart|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that the players are seated differently|pg||
nt|flash: there we go   :)|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Walter Johnson, our resident expert on RM Precision|pg||
nt|flash: and to Barnet Shenkin|pg||
mb|r|nt|jlall: i dont know their system here, this might be their forcing raise or bob might be making a strong jumpshift|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: i think this is hamman's toy showing 5@Ss and 3@Hs with a game force|pg||
nt|jlall: ok|pg||
nt|flash: the forcing NT has been known to cover a wide range?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1N was semi-forcing|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth chooses to make a tactical 1NT response -- he is protected by his partner being limited, so Rodwell can't be jumping to 3NT.|pg||
nt|flash: and welcome back to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX was penalty suggest re:cards|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|flash: morning, all...    welcome (back) to the semi-finals of the Open Trials to select USA 1 for the Bermuda Bowl in the Netherlands next year|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: and 3@H 5-4-2-2 maybe|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jlall: should be an easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N-S 4th best, udca|pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: fair warning - the play has been 'most thoughtful' throughout|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|flash: everything sits wrong for declarer here, but there are no ruffs threatened, so 10 tricks should be available|pg||
nt|lml: if everything had been right they would have been able to make slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|caitlin: hi all :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|flash: for those just joining us, the web site for the event is  www.usbf.org|pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: you'll find Daily Bulletins, System Summary Forms and convention cards there|pg||
nt|kit: The redouble told Stansby that his side was unlikely to have a game -- without that, he might have bid more.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|flash: this is a semi-final match; winner of the event will be USA 1 for Bermuda Bowl in Holland next year|pg||
nt|flash: N-S are K-Sish:  12-14 NT in most positions; 5-card majors; 2/1; Flannery|pg||
nt|kit: Martel plays the heart before cashing the king of diamonds so he will have the quick entries to his hand for 2 club ruffs if the diamonds don't split.|pg||
nt|flash: a separate Trials will be held next year to determine USA 2|pg||
nt|flash: as well as Women's and Senior Trials to pick 2 teams each|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric asks to close screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and asking Lew some q-s|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: if the clubs had worked declarer might well have made 6@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bbramley: even on a passive lead declarer would have been able to cash 2 high trumps and run enough @Ss to throw a club before north could ruff in|pg||
nt|flash: we'll keep half an eye on the other semi-final; the margin is 71, so it might not go the distance|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: your operator is Serge Bondar|pg||
nt|flash: welcome back, Serge  :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|lml: the Diamond team had one big set that accounted for almost all the difference|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: Rodwell will have to ruff this to stop an extra overtrick -- not obvious at all to do that|pg||
pc|dQ|mc|10|nt|caitlin: Hi Jim and Kit and Walter|pg||
nt|barnets: here the club position allows 5@D to make had they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: If he doesn't ruff, Martel can take marked ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||

nt|chorush: I expect a partscore pickup for Fleisher here|pg||
nt|passell: wrong again  N passed but got to 5clubs|pg||
nt|passell: cold |pg||
nt|chorush: Mike would you pass 2H when it came back to you or would you double 2H with Nickell's hand. I would do both|pg||
nt|passell: with diamonds 3-3 not even a trump lead would beat it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|passell: yes both and I would open Nicks hand|pg||

nt|jlall: i think bob will not open 1N here, too strong|pg||
nt|jlall: especially since they open a lot of 14s|pg||
nt|bbramley: no jacks, and a decent 5-card suit - but only 1 ace|pg||
nt|jlall: i know you hate upgrading bart :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we have just reconnected|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: www.usbf.org for daily bulletins, details of this year's competition, System Summary Forms and convention cards|pg||

mb|1H|nt|chorush: hi everyone. I am Ira Chorush |pg||
mb|2C|nt|flash: welcome, Ira|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jlall: i think their range does not include ave + 17s though|pg||
nt|flash: bloodied, but unbowed, we assume...|pg||
nt|chorush: I had the dubious pleasure of losing to the Nickell team in the round of 8|pg||
nt|chorush: but I will try. try again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: your operator for closed room is Serge Bondar|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has a pretty good hand, and is hearing a lot of bidding from the others|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jillan:  Hi all, guess I have nothing better to do on a Swedish Midsummer's Eve then to watch rama. Hope this set produces more interesting hands....|pg||
mb|p|an|alert|nt|me argent: is 3nt inevitable?|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C looks a lot more likely -- Stansby can now project the stiff heart in Martel's hand|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|flash: welcome, Serge|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: an extra card for the weak 2@D opener, but too much defense for 3@D in 1st chair...|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric said that pass of3@h is lead directing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlall: what would you lead here bart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N-S attitude leads vs NT, Smith Echo, udca|pg||
nt|jlall: @SQ seems pretty tempting but im a sucker for 3 card sequences|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Double would say doNOT lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X would say he wanted another leafd|pg||
nt|flash: Board 76 in as a push...   15-board segments|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bbramley: @SQ, in a photo with a heart - i have not problem with leading from ace-fourth|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer will test diamonds and then set up his hearts losing 3 tricks here|pg||
nt|jlall: for now he has to consider whether he will duck the lead or not, if he does hes vulnerable to a club shift but the defense has to find it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|barnets: in other room e/w allowed to play 2@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||

pc|sA|nt|barnets: n/s did not enter the auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: and Nickell will survive the 'violation' of the idea that a pre-empter doesn't take another call|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bbramley: i know N/S play udca, so stansby @H plays may be smith|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: after east opened 2@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|flash: overtrick IMP on 61|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: For whatever reason, the Nickell team has a history of losing its first stanza of the day. Today, they can ill afford it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 2@D pass 2@H passed oot|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bbramley: delay of game|pg||
nt|barnets: Katz never bid his club suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bbramley: that's better|pg||
nt|kit: A trump lead would have prevented the complete crossruff, and might well have been found -- but the AJ of spades would produce a second spade trick so would get up to 11 anyway|pg||

mb|3H|an|splinter|mb|p|nt|chorush: this is destined for 3NT, which may make becasue of hearts 4-4 and favorable situations n the minors|pg||
nt|passell: this auction will pin point the killing heart lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|passell: this mus be a mis print|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: unless I'm hallucinating, this is the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: not sure what 4@c is, hopefully will find out shortly|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|passell: he must think 3hearts is natural and is making a good raise to 4hearts |pg||
nt|harmon: 4c says i dont have a serious 3n maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: several people have suggested Nickell thinks 3@H is natural, and is making a last train type bid|pg||
nt|passell: if he thought 3 hearts was short he would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|chorush: This misunderstanding is going to cost Nickell dearly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: seems like the most plausable explaination at this point|pg||
nt|passell: perhaps thinking about last board|pg||
nt|harmon: coach says Mike is right but Icant remember Mike ever being wrong tho  was 1967 I think|pg||
mb|7H|mb|d|nt|passell: I dont remember being right since then actually|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  did Levin really pass over 7@S?|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz might get out for 500 here. I think the other room will score 400 in 3NT. If I am right this will be 14 imps to fleischer|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: that was merciful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yes, apparently afraid of pushing them to 7N|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|warrens:  in case partner was doubling 7@H with a club void?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|passell: this cant be true|pg||

nt|jlall: bob might just open 2@S here r/w|pg||
nt|bbramley: not a fan|pg||
nt|jlall: he is pretty conservative at this vul|pg||
nt|barnets: swing for fleisher|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: 3@S for me, or just pass if my suit is weaker|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jlall: i like stansbys X|pg||
nt|bbramley: three hearts will deter some people|pg||
nt|jlall: at the 1 or 2 level you should overcall your 5 card suit, but at a higher level it's better to keep everything in play|pg||
nt|jlall: imo|pg||
nt|bbramley: i agree|pg||
nt|kit: apparently their 2@C doesn't have to be clubs, or maybe Martel is just trying to avoid a club lead|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jlall: by everything in play I mean, clubs, diamonds, or a penalty pass from partner|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jlall: stansby is not showign a massive hand here, because martel showed values with his 3@D bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: clear 3@H call after partner shows values|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe diamonds shows 5 cards per system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: with a bad hand he would have bid 2N, lebensohl|pg||
nt|flash: 5@D in the Open Room on 62, so 5 more IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: quite possibly|pg||
nt|flash: appears that Martel-Stansby have added 2@C as a game force, not necessarily showing @Cs (red suit 2/1 requires 5-card length)|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder if 2@C needs alerted|pg||
nt|barnets: if it may be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|kit: I still think he might have simply been making a tactical call.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@h was alerted|pg||
nt|flash: 3@H showed shortness (in support of @Cs)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but I cannot read the notes|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C is balanced GF or clubs, 2@D would have shown 5 -- I get from valid source|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Serge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: tx , Jim|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now I read the shortness|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric: given the 10@d in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 9@d is from 9xx, J9xx, or A9xx|pg||
nt|kit: With ace of hearts off and West having both spade honors, this has problems -- although can make by leading up to 10 of diamonds, getting 3 diamonds, 4 clubs, 1 heart, 1 spade|pg||
nt|flash: fair warning:  the play tends to be most 'thoughtful' - we hope you'll have the patience to stick with us|pg||
nt|barnets: On a heart lead dec could still make by playing @DA  and one towards the 10 here essentially he has the same guess|pg||
nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: But I think he will go down, going after spades instead|pg||
nt|barnets: whether west has !Q sing or !QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: @DQ |pg||
nt|barnets: if he reads the Q as a true card he is home|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jlall: 3N looks like a make|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein had a way to show a singleton spade but felt his hand was not good enough. If his spade Q had been elsewhere. he would have bid different;y|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlall: since you can shut hamman out|pg||
nt|bbramley: lucky make when spades go 7-2 instead of 6-3, AND east has all of the other relevant high cards|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: if spades are 7-2, then hamman probably has nothing else|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding and leads, obvious shift|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: not clear -- he doesn't know yet he has 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: now he will make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but he needs an entry to the @D...  thus needs J or Jx in @C|pg||
nt|barnets: he knows east has the @D8|pg||
nt|kit: so he may think the third diamond trick might not be enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: if Meckstroth is able to duck quickly declarer would have a problem, but ducking is far from obvious|pg||
nt|barnets: why problem? @D8 must be with east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck is thinking...|pg||
nt|barnets: so he can play the 7|pg||
nt|kit: true|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and why a problem at all...  any @D play works|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bbramley: the lead (when north has the 9) and east's failure to raise both suggest the 7-2 split|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and smith echo, high from either side says likes the suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: Meckwell are playing 4@D, after they got Xd in 3NT|pg||
nt|jlall: hi mildred|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi, everyone :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if i were playing all four positions the contract would be 5@D:  3@S-P-4@S-DBL-P-5@D|pg||
nt|jlall: full disclosure... all commentators here are texan so bob hamman is our god ;)|pg||
nt|bbramley: hi mildred|pg||
nt|bbramley: as well as my boss|pg||
nt|jlall: wow bart, if it went 3S X 4S X p i would pass and lead my stiff heart and expect to get a huge number|pg||
nt|jlall: no wonder you bid so much, you dont X yourself :P|pg||
nt|jlall: it was a good double by steve in the other room, i wonder if he did it to get them to run|pg||
nt|bbramley: this time you would, but next time south will have VOID-KQxxx-KQxx-Axxx and west will be void in diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: weinstein is very successful/famous in the poker world, so whenever he Xs a 3N and they run and it's cold I think he played poker|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's a good ploy to double 3NT when you have no idea if they can make it|pg||
nt|bbramley: if they sit you hope to beat it, and if they run to 4 of a minor you'll be happy regardless|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i agree, it ups the stakes tremendously for them and only a little bit for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hamman still thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm a little surprised that meck ran - he plays a little poker himself|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman knows its right to shift since he has no entry to his suit, unfortunately it looks like there is no promising shift|pg||
nt|jlall: sometimes in this situation its right to just set up your suit as a bluff like you have an entry, but here it is futile|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - every shift helps declarer - even a diamond creates an extra entry in diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: still surprising line of play, as he doesn't know he will have an entry to the diamond (after heart shift)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mildredb: need to do that quicker ;)|pg||
nt|barnets: he could play the 7 even had east held the Q the suit was sure for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: the J I meant|pg||
nt|kit: there is going to be a BIG swing on this hand, and Nickell-Katz are having a mixup and are in a grand slam!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck saying sorry... for a long pause|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have a disaster on this board in open rooom bidding 7@S!!|pg||
nt|barnets: undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: amzingly|pg||
nt|barnets: t|pg||
nt|barnets: north responded 2@D to 1@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and after that they were on an unstoppable train|pg||
nt|barnets: but west did not x 7@S|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure why|pg||
nt|kit: What happened I believe is that South bid 3@h splinter, and North thought it was natural|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|barnets: levin said i thought they may run to 7N|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: West didn't double 7@S was afraid of run to 7NT|pg||
nt|barnets: weinstein had already x 7@H|pg||
nt|barnets: so he might have taken a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Martel doesn't know that he is home now, but will soon find out -- what can he do but play a club?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|bbramley: he couldn't afford to guard against KJx with east - no reentry|pg||

nt|bigtrain: riasing @C with values?|pg||

nt|kit: what if he just wanted to play in clubs?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mildredb: what is the alert of 3@S?|pg||
nt|gavin:  my guess is they play it a little stronger than most people|pg||
nt|jlall: they play weak NT so this is strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2nd and 4th leads. Zia might lead low from doubleton, per CC|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: ugly 2NT for Nick|pg||

nt|flash: 28-38 segment score; those rally caps seem to be working!!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|alert|nt|flash: some might be reluctant to value QJ tight as 3 HCP?|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mittmouse: again a lot of tricks in the closed room |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: through 85 boards, Diamond +95|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chorush: seems like it might have gone diamond honor covered and ducked, then a shift|pg||
nt|flash: rather unbelievably, Zia cover the the @DQ at trick 2 (essentially same lead)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lead are attitude, said Steve|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jlall: on best defense this is 2 down|pg||
nt|jlall: if south gets his ruff, and north can get 2 ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: could be essential to cover the diamond|pg||
nt|kit: from declarer's point of view this hand is not cold -- spades could be 5-2 with king of diamonds off|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he should play the j and not the q because he has to cover the j|pg||
nt|kit: very good point George -- quite subtle|pg||
nt|kit: but not sure applicable here -- covering with Kxx won't work anyway|pg||
nt|chorush: He cant afford to duck the J; Really can't duck the Q either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: looks like martel gave suit preference for spades, strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: partner might have Jx|pg||
nt|kit: and his partner might have stiff queen.  But it is a nice theme to remember|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Close 4@H here -- declarer has serious entry problems to his hand, and will not be able to establish and run diamonds I don't think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chorush: so now we will have a push if levin doesnt cash|pg||
nt|flash: so now, either the @SA gets cashed or the trick goes away|pg||
nt|flash: what can i say?  the extra comma took valuable time...|pg||
nt|chorush: levin has hope that his partner has Jx of diamonds and that declarer will misguess|pg||
nt|kit: Levin will be hoping declarer doesn't have jack of diamonds and needs to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: so he won't cash -- in fact, he'll probably play back a diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: the cashout might make that holding irrelevant letting declarer have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: this is on the @S position?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mittmouse: i dont think he should cover the q because if declarer needs 5 tricks in the suit ducking will cover all  situatios|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: sme contract and opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: signal is u/d|pg||
nt|kit: but he can take 3 club ruffs, and with a good spade guess emerge with 6 trump tricks, 1 diamond, 2 spades, and 1 club|pg||
nt|flash: loser-on-loser in @Cs??|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|s4|nt|kit: and if South had KJx of diamonds, presumably he would never cover the queen|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|flash: this doesn't appear to work (on a trump shift)|pg||
nt|kit: this is another possibility -- gets him a club winner, but not a spade winner, so still needs 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff is holding @h5|pg||
nt|kit: trump shift looks pretty easy to find from East's point of view I think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: Now will have to set up the diamonds -- are the entries there?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe they are -- ace of hearts, 10 of clubs, spade to ace, diamond ...|pg||
nt|barnets: so 4@H made inopen|pg||
nt|kit: East wins, trump, king of hearts, king of diamonds, spade ruff, diamond ruff, spade ruff, good diamond -- yes, it works|pg||
nt|kit: specs say I misanalyzed -- let's see what I have wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open room where meck played  trump weinstein played a club|pg||
nt|barnets: at trick 3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe if East doesn't continue trumps|pg||
nt|flash: @C now|pg||
nt|kit: yes, East plays club, West pitches diamond|pg||
nt|flash: takes away the late entry|pg||
nt|barnets: yes club now|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth has to work this out -- the trump continuation seems like the reflex play|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|barnets: makes on trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|flash: well done by the defense|pg||
nt|kit: yes, so important on defense to work the full hand out rather than making a reflex play|pg||
nt|flash: 10 IMPs and right back where we started the segment|pg||
nt|barnets: now when north trumps a @D in dummy west can overuff and play trump|pg||
nt|kit: And 4 boards ago it looked like the match might be over -- amazing how quickly the imps can fly|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice defense|pg||
nt|barnets: dec plays @DK @S ruff @D ruff overuufed and trump back|pg||
nt|barnets: leaves him a spade loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip is thinking, Jeff is looking at the score card|pg||
nt|barnets: or he may try the @H finesse without success|pg||
nt|vbman: T|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to the defense is west discard of a diamond on the club|pg||
nt|kit: at other table play started the same, but Weinstein failed to find initial trump shift and then there were enough trumps to make.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip call for @sq|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Thankx to Jeff to correct|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

mb|d|nt|passell: great job Adam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: I will be doing the 7th segment, and will have off for the final segment -- maybe commentating as mtvesuvius :)|pg||

nt|chorush: this last seems very flat. Both declaers will do a lot of worrying about bad splits in the major and beathe a sig of relief when all is well|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: last board in this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will resumed in 5-7 mins|pg||
nt|flash: also, the European Championships are in full swing|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for events and local times|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bigtrain: meck likes the spots|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: Light opening bids on hands like South has are often effective, but this time will get them overboard as in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: good choice on this hand as game has lots of play|pg||
nt|kit: should be easy 4@H or 4@S contract here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  what an ugly hand to lead from |pg||
nt|gavin:  complete guesswork|pg||
nt|kit: wow -- 4@H went down in other room -- that's a surprise|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gavin:  good choice|pg||
nt|mildredb: great lead|pg||
nt|jlall: usually a major is good here, but usually Jxx is terrible|pg||
nt|jlall: so that was his problem heh|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S may not make either -- probably will go wrong in spades, so may have to guess jack of hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein might consider passing 3@D.  The problem is that his 2@C is game-forcing, so he partner could have a really strong hand and not need to jump|pg||
nt|kit: but on this lead, it will make, as will pitch club on good diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: that will be 13imps|pg||
nt|kit: so will probably unblock diamonds, ace of spades, spade to king, king of diamonds, making 5 or 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric is asking about @d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gavin:  the Q@S was a better technical play by stansby|pg||
nt|gavin:  need to keep the communication in the spade suit open|pg||
nt|chorush: will Katz eschew his diamonds for the unbid suit?|pg||
nt|flash: don't wander too far, folks; apparently a good chance to start again in advance of scheduled time...|pg||
nt|chorush: obviously i had no idea who was on lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, not making that much, as king of diamonds ruffed, but still will make|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|scotty: If Stansby flies with the second black ace.....|pg||
nt|mildredb: does N get squeezed in minors?|pg||
nt|gavin:  NS play attitude leads|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like one of those unfortunate 3NT hands where declarer is shut out of both his hand and dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: I think ace of spades, spade to king is right -- if South is 2-2 in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: But Rodwell was worried about possible 4-1 spade split -- maybe he is right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|passell: down 2 is good bridge for declarer|pg||
nt|chorush: if Nick can find a duck here they might beat it more than 2|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gavin:  so south needed to be a little concerned that his partner may have Jxxxx and that declarer has stiff K|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Nickell is afraid that if he ducks declarer can switch to clubs and have enough tricks with the spade trick stolen|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|passell: he took the cinch|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin:  this line of play didndt work out well for hamman|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't see a way that a club pitch would cost|pg||
nt|bbramley: i thought of one - if south has @CKx and @DQ, then a club pitch allows the 4th club to set up|pg||
nt|gavin:  for news and articles abt the trials and europeans and other bridge stuff pls chk out my website www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|curtis: looks like brad moss was the only one to make 3n on this board|pg||
nt|bbramley: many kibs argue that south must have @CA, else he's have played @SQ at trick one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|chorush: as would I|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: so he will make 10 tricks now, 12 IMP pickup|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets: so nickell recover39 imps in last few boards|pg||
nt|kit: odd he didn't hook Noth for jack of hearts, as no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you back here in 55 minutes and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|barnets: 49 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: actually|pg||
nt|barnets: now trail by only 20|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: He said if @hJ drops, I made 5|pg||
nt|barnets: remarkable|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein has picked up a couple of late swings to reduce the margin to 74; might have another segment there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Thx everybody for watching|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we will re-start the broadcast at 3:45CST|pg||
