mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|the saint: 2@S correct rebid with minimum hand - worth one more bid, so show support rather than the clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|sharynr: North has a good-bad hand, good @s,@C and singleton @D|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharynr: Bad = wasted @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|sharynr: So rather iffy to bid a non-vul game, especially when South makes tries with 9|pg||
nt|the saint: EW playing Ice relay precision|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sharyn|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi there :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|the saint: That is a style thing for pairs to sort out - aggressive tries or aggressive accepts. Can't really do both|pg||
nt|lestergold: Father and son partnership for Wales|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharynr: Yes, we can see that he would have been much placed to play a low trump off the dummy at trick 2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot understand either the 3c game try or the 4s aceptance with min 12 count and only 3 spades|pg||
nt|sharynr: and to have played clubs by cashing the ace first later on|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eweber: hi all|pg||

nt|peachy: Tha hacketts play 4-card majors, light style. The Godeds play Transfer Walsh with 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be easy to reach 4@h....cards aren't so well-placed|pg||

pc|s5|nt|yuval10: they might play it from S in the OR|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|the saint: 4333 just to bid 3N?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|the saint: Effectively what the Icemen did next door|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well alan mould would not approve of this sequence|pg||
nt|the saint: A puppet stayman sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: just had a debate in the ebu mag about using stayman on 4333 hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: its ok if it turns out if one of the hands is unbalanced here it is a disaster|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharynr: Partners who open 2NT are not always 4-3-3-3, so could easily be right to play in spades...however maybe not on this hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: even with dim lead and tne spades pick upable has to lose a dim a club and 2 hearts unlessw defence slips up|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well Frances hinden would agree with u she spoke for that view against alan mouid quite an interesting debate|pg||
nt|sharynr: but one has to decide whether to always bid 3NT with these hands, and not zig and zag in decision making|pg||

nt|lestergold: i tink north was wrong here because qith only an ace and a q it looks like a 9 tricks the limit hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: what if partner had 5@S? even more reason to play @S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|sharynr: no doubleton KQ @H, unfortunately|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|mc|9|nt|lestergold: its a question of what you think is with the odss does ur experience tell you that you are more likely to gain bidding 3n or stayman|pg||

nt|ziff:  Relaxed start...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Odd - looked like 8 tricks with the @D finesse?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eleni: @h@h Kalimera se olous|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: quite rare to see 2@c serving as "inverted"|pg||

mb|p|nt|collins64: good morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?26046.0 post_26060|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa likely to pass this as S could not open|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everyone passes the s hand even with the poor @S structure.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|star6ija: 1N all pass|pg||
nt|haans: gadgets|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did not feel for it|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're due for some interesting matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
pc|d9|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  solved|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|rigas_karo: kalimera se olous|pg||
nt|star6ija: J@h was better continuation|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||
nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: +1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Operator, a couple of typos in North's name   Haraldsson|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|nt|eweber: as I just see Russia is playing with Khiuppenen-Kholomeev in the closed room, NL with Wijs-Muller|pg||
pc|s3|nt|aldek: you could play for @CK in north|pg||
nt|mamos: David prederving that 1D2|pg||
nt|mamos: @d2|pg||
nt|cameron_1: thinking followed by going down most likely :(|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT much better contract than 4@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but with both hand's 4-3-3-3 both of thy would rather stand in 3nt|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SJT9632HKQDJ32C95,SQ7H76DAT854CAK84,SAK8HAJ84DQ7CQT32,S54HT9532DK96CJ76|sv|e|nt|lestergold: need to run a few million deals thru a computer to settle this|pg||
nt|sharynr: i personally never get those right :(|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: thats bwhy you and i are commentating and not playing .... lol...|pg||
nt|sharynr: true true|pg||
nt|the saint: North's ibd depends on his expectations of a 1st NV Weak 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not an unreasonable 2@s but may be hard to stay out of 4@s funnily enuf 3n makews|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharynr: if this is some kind of suit quality/hcp showing thing they may stay out|pg||
nt|the saint: CC not completely clear|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@d probably says bad suit and minimum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|the saint: Seems likely|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharynr: so now a matter of losing an imp or pushing the board|pg||
nt|lestergold: north corrwectly treats his two Q doubletomns as if they were low doubletons whioch opp a weak 2 they are de facto equivalent to|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

nt|boyklas: hi all, elinescu-wladow play precision right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes interesting. No slam makes from S, but 6@D makes from N|pg||
nt|haans: been there|pg||
nt|mamos: ??|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ziff:  Strong club|pg||
nt|motu: 6@C from N is cold, because of  6-1 @H |pg||
nt|lmeili: yes 6@c by N always cold, W has no @h to cash when wins @c K|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly play fast!!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt here|pg||
nt|shevek: both pairs play 2/1 GF ; cc at: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
mb|2N|nt|star6ija: something like 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a heart pip shourt of a good slam here   can make by dropping A@H doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|star6ija: do they change the systems?|pg||
nt|haans: all you need for slam is no clubs lead :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i dotn think j@c was played|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|eweber: unluckily we still don't have running scores from group B in the Open|pg||
nt|motu: DBL is 6-8|pg||
nt|boyklas: 1@h is a transfer to @ss|pg||
nt|lmeili: easy 3N for EW|pg||
nt|boyklas: nvul, would you have bid 3@s now?|pg||
nt|motu: not my style|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam 6@C is the best spot    6@H down quickly on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but slam is a little far fetched if you ask me|pg||
nt|davidb: N practically looks at 8HCP|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT on the same|pg||
nt|star6ija: and to guess heart position of course|pg||
nt|aldek: operator, what has happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again 3nt is better then 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s = 6 cards, Max|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hello Murat|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Murat|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:   Haraldsson got scared?|pg||
nt|shevek: well stopped|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if 3@s shows max, then north must go 4@s no?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, I see now it shows 6@s and minimum|pg||
pc|c7|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||
nt|shevek: with Max he'd bid 3 in a new suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makes sense then|pg||
nt|Walddk12: We'll have the name corrected soon. I asked our coordinator to go to the room|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Some operators don't look at their screen|pg||
nt|andreasw:  let's say Magnusson had show,n max would u bid 4@s or 3nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s for me|pg||

nt|andreasw:  u dont really have ace's and king's and the minor suit's is not wery good in 4@s i think i would bid 3nt and let p decide|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Name corrected|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|bagman: 5@C is a good bet|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Where are we going now? is 4@S Keycard?|pg||
nt|haans: nope cue no dim con|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a hand for topping up the caffeine|pg||
nt|shevek: Iceland lost their 1st match vs Italy (14-16) and then went on winning the next 10|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe they shouldn't be so keen not vul|pg||
pc|s2|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|yuval10: good def. so far|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see what line declarer will take....|pg||

nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||
nt|star6ija: some prospects for making|pg||
nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||
mb|2N|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: S has good values with A@c and K@h but can she ask about N's distribution|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt force?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||

nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andersk: agree|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|haans: @DK must be cover both other suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now take @d finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andersk: finally|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can't hurt|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|peachy: best to get a diam out now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not abt @c count|pg||
nt|haans: most swedes 8 = odd |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 2 (the mirror hand) Iceland gained 12 imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: if declarer has 2 clubs always makes|pg||
nt|haans: no a copunt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: Now the endplay in spades for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Obviously listening to you Anders :)|pg||
nt|andersk: abot time:)|pg||
nt|andersk: about|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then declarer wld be a @h less and a @c more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c K favorably placed always makes, west doesn't need to care signals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just count it out more and make fine judgement|pg||
nt|andreasw:  claim|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|haans: are they claiming?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very careless play by the declarer and very nice defence by West|pg||

nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||

nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: any explanation of the 2@C bid operator|pg||
nt|the saint: Many pairs still have methods to show both majors after 1C-1D (Precision)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|sharynr: They bid @S and @C and he leads hearts...having a tough time with this one|pg||
nt|the saint: South may think the methods apply over 1C-1D|pg||
nt|the saint: NS play a CRO defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: Jones senior ignoring spade bid and finding winning lead here|pg||
nt|the saint: So South was looking for a minor fit perhaps (1S = two of same rank)|pg||

nt|athene: 7@H here - let's see if they find it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he had 11 trick's|pg||
mb|1C|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
mb|d|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
pc|h7|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||
nt|motu: vul 1nt is 18-19 non vul 20-21|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: @H 9 for @D switch|pg||
nt|haans: Q and J for @D switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hQ for @s switch|pg||
nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||

nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||

pc|s3|pc|hJ|nt|andersk: understand|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
nt|fokal: some kind of transfer ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes'|pg||
mb|3C|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||

nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||

pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||

nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
pc|cK|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
pc|h6|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||

nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||

nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||

nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the 5-5 minor gadget worked for the wales pair|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could well go down on spade lead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||

nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||

nt|athene: ok :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||

nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||

nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||

nt|roswolf: a real solo flight of fancy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT???|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-3 spade fit and both hands unbalanced|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer could be in difficulties if trumps were 4-1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: my guess is 3nt was "serious" and also "seriously misunderstood"|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: just 2 aces  in a spades contract|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt is makeable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm a 4 card major opening|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcarroll: seems to be turning into a rout. 57 imps in the bag and probably another 11 from board 10, so68-0 at half-time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 58 excuse me|pg||
nt|haans: we must assume pen dbl not possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: lebensohl now, i persume|pg||
nt|star6ija: partscore board again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at this point, iceland and italy are the runaway leaders of the group|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: at the OR 2H is playing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@s looks a possible spot here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hre we are - allez les bleus|pg||
nt|athene: some people think the double jump after t/o double should be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: others play it as limit bid; i.e. better than single jump|pg||
nt|athene: clearly Mari is in the second camp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by EW?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks possible at any lead, I think - taking for given, that the @D-finesse is working |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 22VP ahead of the 3rd ranked france|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andersk: 2@HX is probably -2|pg||

nt|haans: good body everywere|pg||
nt|shevek: 4NT two places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2NT from S most likely would've make her declarer, as N would've bided 3NT anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 5@d = @d + @h|pg||
nt|shevek: a bit high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: at least 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do we agree with the double of 4@s?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rigas_karo: this will be down 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a perfect fit here|pg||
nt|star6ija: and 3@d|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Is it true?:)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of work|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG will need to guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|mamos: that lead directing opening has resulted in the best lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With the clubs 3-3 there is no obvious defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: have no idea why did not touch spades before diamonds|pg||

nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me to|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: claim soon|pg||
nt|star6ija: trump lead is the best for EW|pg||

nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||

nt|pitiful:  still at least we are better than them at football|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: Trump continuing the good work|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next question. do you agree with 4nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with 4-4=|pg||

mb|1H|nt|the saint: If he is, how many is he taking out of 4S?|pg||

nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ady: last hand with the diamonds well hand South might have ducked the first spade  and if spades continued  north night have played the 10 on the 2nd round as a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s shows?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a normal weak 2?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in my book it would be to strong for a weak bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: On the other hand, that was an awfully quacky hand, even with 15 "Pearson Points" (hcp + number of @ss.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a knowledgeable spec tells me: maybe invitational (or almost) with spades|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vasmar: 2 diamonds and one heart for a routine 620|pg||

nt|tomi2:  he will be rewarded with friendly breaks all around except of hearts - the best knws he can get. but Smirnov made 4@H so there will ne no huge swing|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: but 10-13 look solid Dutch results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S|pg||

nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||

nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||

mb|5C|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||

nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||

nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||

nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||

nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||

mb|1S|nt|haans: 1@H correct?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry I have to leave   thanks all  England 5 imps   the fight back begins|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unlucky 13 for the dutch?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: 4@H and still no suits have been shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: For minors-non vul against vul.|pg||

nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not if @h AJx sit's by west and @s K on east:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|collins64: it looks like it was a quick pass from North|pg||

nt|andreasw:  then again east could have dbl 1@h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for the lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: would that just ask for a lead or show a real suit?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well done!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||

nt|paulg:  hi Paul, everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2:  board 12 German open pair bid 7@H missing !AS and Qxx-x in their sidesuit...|pg||
nt|yuval10: yesterday there was something similer to NS in the OR here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2210|pg||
nt|yuval10: they bided to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: vs Belgium|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they didn't make :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow always makes his grands|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: a routine 3NT now|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, not much here|pg||
nt|vasmar: good board for Austria in order to hold the difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: litle reak in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: break I mean|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx operator|pg||
nt|vasmar: but boards 14 and 15 are good for Germany|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably they will take the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will west pre-empt with 4 cards in other major?|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-0 to much|pg||
nt|shevek: this 6@s is claimable at trick 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes and should be reach easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: who would have guessed 210 wins |pg||
nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||
nt|ady: should be a lot of bidding here |pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: that result doesn't seem likely, unless he played it the same way as he bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Hi Paul|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this could now be very feisty|pg||
nt|star6ija: more undos|pg||

nt|haans: N 3@D????|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 170 will be flat|pg||
nt|motu: now 3@D would show 4441|pg||
nt|motu: there it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think e/w may well declare a heart contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: level is questionable though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt seems a stretch.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a difficult rebid the way the auction went|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt seems a bit of an underbid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: J@D lead beats 5@C would have tht west might have gone straight to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i guess it will be difficult to stay low here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow has some ideas on working / not working finesses in Grand Slams depending on vulnerbility and board number|pg||
nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry for the shouting|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the pass by east|pg||
nt|andreasw:  strong @c?|pg||
nt|shevek: no|pg||
nt|shevek: 2+|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C is rkcb and 4NT 2+@SQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am told 1 unfortunate south played in 6@s doubled on the previous board|pg||
nt|dburn: did he make it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well you might have made it David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but I think he went 1 off|pg||
nt|shevek: wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what about @h?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
mb|4N|nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 14-16|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
mb|6S|nt|tomi2:  voila|pg||
nt|lmeili: wow!|pg||
nt|ziff:  Seems to be the right board number|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you could probably write a very long article or even a book on just that board, where is David Bird|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|dK|nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||

nt|barbyh: since 1 d is artificial how wd he know it isnt a real d suit|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1 problem with passing of course, is that North might sacrifice in 5@D later on, assuming reds|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
nt|shevek: sry andreas but they are 47imps behind with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u must have a note on yr cigarette package|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@S here depend on heart play after a club lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so no beer,s:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: smoking makes you miscount the trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: he did say he doesn't want to get old :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
nt|shevek: aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: If they bid 4, defence always take their 4 minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: maybe :)|pg||
nt|haans: xx standard here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 3@s assuming south does not try to cash @c ace|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andreasw:  should make here unless N-S will find the @c switch|pg||
nt|shevek: they're busy playing @ss though|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sK|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for providing this service to bridge lovers worldwide.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently only 14 tables on vg. http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like one too many|pg||
nt|haans: 23.45 central time next session|pg||
nt|haans: 13.45 |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
nt|shevek: here....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: 5@D made so 9 to Neth.|pg||
nt|shevek: done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: well done|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: when in hand @CQ and !K@C to force W to play Ace @C|pg||
nt|vasmar: unmakeable|pg||
nt|vasmar: only Kx in hearts onside|pg||
nt|drkvas: v well done|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: small @c now can could could problems|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: *could create some problems|pg||
nt|star6ija: now we have position for endplay|pg||
pc|h6|nt|star6ija: if S refuse to play @hs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|ady: good defence by north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish team playing same contract with same spade but at trick 3 a club switch same|pg||

nt|sharynr: at this point I would go to the washroom|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: Some explanations here between EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharynr: I dont know if they were damaged because operator did not "alert" 1@H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sharynr: 1NT was not forcing in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: I'm operating from the VU graph room, don't get the alert information every time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: 2NT may or may not be an underbid according to some|pg||
nt|sharynr: ok no prob JJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|sharynr: when he knows that his partner has 9 cards in @H and @C, perhaps it is better to take the non-forcing route|pg||

nt|roswolf: thanks to J-J our operator - great job|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session     thx all|pg||
nt|roswolf: and to my fellow commentators the 2 Davids|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm is the tourny web-site.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unusual to say the least?|pg||
nt|shevek: another 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vasmar: this is tha last board|pg||
nt|haans: he had very little to go on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  will guessthem appear again?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  excllent 6@h here|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: did I say a few?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|reisig: A great comeback by Germany!|pg||

nt|pitiful:  save|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a great board to finish the match|pg||
nt|mamos: even at this vul?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if e-w do get pushed to 7@h will he make it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 back to England on 17 |pg||
nt|pitiful:  south wisely did not overcall |pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|santyclz: 2@d or a @c splinter?|pg||
nt|cumino: bilanciatone senza cuori|pg||
nt|rialc2: secondo te non ha tentato il fit a @H?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and e-w did well to bid and make 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cumino: sry|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||

nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||
nt|aldek: till next time|pg||
nt|nyg8:  5HX was striptail monkey - i.e. stop then from gettnig to 6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North might well have bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok andreas we analyze that board and send you the results by a sealed envelope|pg||
