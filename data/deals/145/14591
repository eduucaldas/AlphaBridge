nt|Vugraphzfj: Oftentimes very difficult for begging players to diagnose misfit hands, oftentimes the best strategy is to get out as low as possible, don't dig the hole any deeper|pg||
nt|dredog03: Good morning!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|caitlin: what are 2@D and 2N?|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: This is especially true of younger players---do not mean to be stereotypical or biased here:) But based on my yrs of working w/the Jnrs I have notiiced this running theme|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Raina needs to be bidding,   I would prefer 2@S last round but certainly she needs to bid 2@S now|pg||
nt|harlan: using "loser trick count" it is only a 7 loser hand.  using rule of 20 it makes it.  SO, I would open it only one 1H, myself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: counting high card points when you are 6-6 is a trap:   you can make lots of tricks in your long suit|pg||
nt|harlan: actaully, expecting the opps to bid @Ds, 3C seems like the better bid last round, planning to bid 3D over 3D|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Rizzo nibbling away at the lead here towards the end :)|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: That's what I meant|pg||
nt|dude2010: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Ricoh alerted as promising 5@h|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So it is incumbenton West to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|dredog03: so the face that the alert says 5-4, they might be playing 2@h here as invitational..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a true garbage stayman would pass 2@d|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vdoubleu: OK, if that is hteir agreement--OK--but not standard|pg||
