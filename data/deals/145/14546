mb|3S|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
mb|6D|nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
pc|d2|nt|antoniz: bilans sto³u zosta³ zgubiony,trudno|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy|pg||
nt|pasker: Yes always relieving to see game going down as well if you are not doubled|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: S needs to shift to @H else @S finesse will protect @HK and will make|pg||

nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||

nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||

nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||

nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||

nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: problems|pg||

pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: wg mnie to spory blad powiedziec 1 ba - E po 2 treflach opsa da kontre T.o a spasuje na 2kier, 2 karo |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||

nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: well 3N was stiff? Only from North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great Dane you mean?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: 1@s alerted as it may be canape (Walsh)|pg||
nt|atabey: it was the first blood indeed. only the other side :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, they said 10 first then 11... :(|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: minors break badly tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6N is a decent spot. Without a diamond lead its wash, and otherwise you have to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|rodvenn: was 1 sp alerted?|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did find Madala with two beautiful cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, it mustn't have registered on BBO|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||

nt|andyv:  for betting people, for far this match you needed to bet on the unders|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can's beat 6NT on any lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  true, but 5@d the practical call|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe South might have done well to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S shows 0-3 cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: np Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Damn bridge players, the world would be better off without us :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot bid inverted 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but no reason to stay out of the game|pg||
nt|rodvenn: did now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bas!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: if South could find 3NT on Jx .. it makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pointing to 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W did miss a chance to really muddle things up by not bidding 3@h on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like North took 4NT as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 3@s was the ideal bid|pg||
nt|pasker: Do people agree with dble from N?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  and my apologies... She missed a chance:)|pg||

nt|jtr: for those that are interested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also available for those who are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have a Bocchi0Duboin convention card up and 1@S shows diamonds for that partnership. Cannot find one for this partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told this gives the scores:  for running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking probably not a winner but Madala is unaware of the bad splits|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||

nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||

nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|an|*|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||

nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||

nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||

nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
pc|h7|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no risks|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was all the more reason for North to lead a heart, looking for a ruff, because the Italian auction had been confident - including some cue bids.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: that is the result announced by the players|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tez: right yalcin..it was 10 trick|pg||
nt|bagman: As Lauria had safe 10 tricks he did not risk the contract by trying for an overtrick by leaving a lurker trump at large|pg||
nt|andyv:  was it really safe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  could S have had a high @D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Panayiotou called the TD because Lauria claimed to fast and didn't show his cards, he feels|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: too fast even|pg||
nt|bagman: IMO, yes 3 spades, 1 club 1 ruff ad 5 trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Lauria can ruff a diamond and discard one on the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: then give away AQ of clubs|pg||

nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|hedyg: 5@ds, 4@s and 1@c|pg||

nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||

nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||

nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||

nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||

nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||

nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||

pc|h8|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||

nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||
mc|10|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||

nt|jtr: As i said, in keeping with transfer responses|pg||
nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||

nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||
nt|daman: now a @S game for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: while the Italians stop playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||
nt|snetram:  kara trzeba grac na impas|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a 13?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@H showed a real suit|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kierowym bedzie trochê k³opotów|pg||
nt|antoniz: nie da siê komunikacyjnie po kierowym|pg||
nt|snetram:  tylko impas karo moze daÄ dodatkowÄ lewÄ|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie na 2 stronne przebitki ma 12 lew|pg||
nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
nt|xenya: over the double|pg||
nt|bogier: na przebitki jest 12|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the redbl may have been too expensive for him if they made it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, this contract isn't all that elegant|pg||
nt|lesniak: 8 atutow ak kier +2 asy|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: i already had my money on England...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As long as he has the play to back it up :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if 2 @h showed a heart suit a pass is surely ok - a redbl often used after an x to make prd bid his major|pg||
nt|antoniz: pisa³em o 13-tu|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I am told that Iceland has extended its lead by 7 IMPs and 1 IMP on boards 8 and 9.|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 tricks off the top and a 6th if they don't squander their @d communications|pg||
nt|andyv:  N on lead so trot out his AK@h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: If NS are happy with their methods, I see no reason why we should judge them|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: At least you qualified, unlike Sweden and Norway, who have been strong in the past.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Regarding England, The Times headline said that is one spill the US won't object to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @S8|pg||
nt|mbruun: Seems like three spade losers if he covers the Sp 8|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|pasker: S should be able to give suit preference on the 2nd @H|pg||

pc|dK|nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
nt|snetram:  ma jeszcze czas przez dwie lewy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was told 11, but corrected to 10 now|pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||

nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||

nt|andy_h: Bas, did South ask West of his preempting styles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not Madala's set, 30 of the 31 IMPs were caused by wrong decisions |pg||

nt|Walddk2: either way, we have a close match now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very intgeresting deals in this set|pg||

nt|coolvijay: seems a routine spade game for N-S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  i guess they were thinking more of Meckwell than Scotland|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||

nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||

nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: South can place declarer with a double stopper in clubs and is considering if he can cast his net elsewhere.|pg||

nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||

nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||

nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had five double-figure swings to Italy on the first six boards. Since then only a dribble of IMPs. A margin 51 or more is needed for a maximum win in VPs.   |pg||

nt|mdgraham: spad to the six?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: not sure South does either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||
nt|mbruun: Its almost impossible for him after East has shown 5cH|pg||

nt|bagman: The auction might get repeated here|pg||
nt|mbruun: Grand on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 Sp will be reached|pg||

nt|brgpro: that's why i stay in the PABF zone:)|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Orange (Dutch team's nickname) played badly as well, but at least we got out with 1-0 and 2-0 victories :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1level Italian overcalls can be very weak|pg||
nt|othered1: they feel strongly about getting in at the 1-level.  Failure to do so is meaningful.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: (Obviously I didn't disturb Versace during play btw)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR seems to be playing in 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I am a Dry Stone Waller, all day long I Dry Stone Wall. Of all appalling callings, Dry Stone Walling's worst of all (Pam Ayres)|pg||

nt|othered1: This is a coffee hand, but better brew it quickly.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||
nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphznk: Sport, Spanning und Sensation!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to make 7 tricks here for -100|pg||
nt|bagman: This is more like no limit poker :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Who's got the biggest balls|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble, says North!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h weak looks ok to me as a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to know?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: When I played bridge with my mother Sunday she just hoped and dumped me in 7NT=|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Finesse onside|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: so should lose two spades and a heart from here, for a boring 110|pg||
nt|andy_h: The cc only says 2@C is stayman, not sure what 3@C is|pg||
nt|brolucius: An exciting auction!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: It shouldnt be all that weak when the opposition dont seem to be coming into the auction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: yes   sigh|pg||
nt|snetram:  albo canape, albo kanapa po polsku|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR has finished|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is in the nice position that it doesn't matter how many tricks he makes as long as he makes at least 6|pg||
nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for shape  3@D  3343 or 3334  3@H asking  3NT  3334   If Bocchi had four diamonds, Madala might have been interested in slam|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Still plenty of vugraph today. The Swiss Cup Jean Besse from Geneva just started. 48 boards to be played there|pg||
nt|brgpro: in talking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, China women lost to Singapore|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland will Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
nt|bagman: West had a very marginal T/O X by passed hand. With the @DQ changed to @HQ, he would have doubled, I think|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|capercliff: play to drop QJ stiff before trying for 3@s tricks|pg||

nt|capercliff: so it looks to me that either hand can have lenght in @s's|pg||
nt|capercliff: this could be important in terms of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might consider playing the K@d then 4 rounds of @c's, but that doesnt really help him here|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|brolucius: The deals have been strangely subdued, in all three sessions that I have watched from this event. (No bonus should be paid to the provider of the auto-dealer).|pg||

nt|andyv:  S likes his 10hcp and dbl @h stopper|pg||
nt|pasker: W might also be thinking about whether to compete|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W is done|pg||
nt|pasker: likely to have a fit in 1 of the minors but is difficult to get to p to chose the right one|pg||
nt|andyv:  marginal hand and void in pd's suit doen not make that a good offensive hand.|pg||
nt|pasker: and a void @H is an obvious downside|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He played partner's pass to be for penalties|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Typo :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: 430|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Excellent - the Lithuanians bid the spade slam  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a great rule I can recommend for working out whether partner has passed a redouble for penalties|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf nat or balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy slam in a black suit here if East can showing his singleton heart|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jtr: Is this the right board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent bridge, many redoubles|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would want to bid one of my majors here but seems to be a mix up?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c may show extras?|pg||
nt|jbgood: actually a di ruff can always be administered in a heart contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H by East can also be defeated if you are psychic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and want to be in the newspapers and magazines|pg||
nt|rodvenn: already well done. but impossible to reach 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running EC scores|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: This is likely to go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c overcall by W might not be a favorite by all|pg||
nt|bagman: Requires something like @DA and diamond and then heart finesse to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have this hand to discuss at length later as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is exactly 5-4 with 15 hcps|pg||
nt|bagman: With xxx in diamonds, N expects fit to some suit as S probably has at most xx in diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D are makeble, 3@h no|pg||
nt|bagman: With a higher spot than @H7, South might get an idea (I know N is passed)|pg||
nt|pasker: S may even be able to promote the @H7 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|bagman: if he had 3 trump tricks and the defensive values in the minors, X might net sometimes 300, which is 5IMPs better than 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: other room found 4@S, to their regret as cards lie.|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder what 3@s means?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S= short in @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided to stay one level lower - not making pref to @C|pg||
nt|bagman: 3@C would have been an easier make I guess (needing 4 club tricks)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|daman: transportation is an issue on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 @S may turn out ok as well|pg||
nt|bagman: The spades are nicely but the clubs need to be worked on|pg||
nt|bagman: More chances to go wrong in 2 spades. In 3@C the line of play is sortof forced|pg||
nt|bagman: and if you double only contracts which go down, you double too seldom|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's interesting how aggressive NS have been in the bidding but not in the doubling.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: ah 2NT opened|pg||
nt|brgpro: everyday i learn something new.....what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: and what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c KC?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s 2 without?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now it is completely dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double is Lightner, asking for an unusual lead, normally dummy's suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule to "pass" is frequently a good rule :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's always nice when you get to ruff with your singleton trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = "Partner, I have a void, your job to figure out where"|pg||
nt|xenya: might go 2 off -- not that it matters much|pg||
nt|bagman: defense is often the hard part of the game and to make marginal doubles one has to rely on good defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
nt|antoniz: poziom operatorów jest pora¿aj¹cy|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Pekka - 3@C more of a "coffee" hand|pg||
nt|bagman: now N has quite clearcut AK clubs |pg||
pc|cK|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
nt|bogier: a u nas juz trenuje ekipa operatorów na przysz³oroczne ME w Poznaniu :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ju¿ zaczêli trykaæ,tak trzymaæ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: shud make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 2x diamonds, @CT and club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump promotion.|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: ruff!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: game over|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|d6|nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Rare misdefense by Sementa|pg||
nt|bagman: he probably did not believe that the declarer would take that line with that hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: and their auction is what we'd see from many standard system players.  Some weak NTers might get to 3N after 3@S by east, but from the other side.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he would have lost three trumps tricks when trumps were breaking very favourably for him.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Scoring up: "We have 430" .... "How did you make an overtrick in 3NT"?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as 1@c can be a balanced 19-23, I reckon South thought that that was what North had, and that he would bid with any other type|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I believe it can be passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With long @Ds only, I take it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fun contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|bagman: He was right; there was no legitimate chance to make it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Guaranteed make, pretty much|pg||
nt|mbruun: He will get the diamonds right and make it for sure |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Have to bid it first, though|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 14 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And 2 without @S cue? 5NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have only 7 tricks in diamonds because of the bad diamond break|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should allow W to come in|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 4@H, cue in @H maybe in @s as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he does|pg||
mb|d|an|!H|nt|atabey: and some luck too :) anyways they are far the best in europe|pg||

nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||

nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||

pc|d6|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: These people must've played with Joey "NEXT!" Silver :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That really shouldn't have happened.  South's discard on the second diamond MUST tell a story|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, she should discourage hearts ... maybe she did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: third hand for NS to have a little chat about....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Chat?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe shell shocked after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are they married?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 6@S was not such a wonderful slam as I thought at first. Various things could go wrong, but still pretty good.|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo nasi:)|pg||
nt|pasker: a bit of a careless claim there, not checking to see if the @HJ comes down|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: perhaps surprised neither room made any attempt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  ill fitting hands|pg||

nt|bjacobs: If so, forget the chat - go straight to the lawyers|pg||
nt|andy_h: Ah ok. In the passout seat they play DONT|pg||
nt|andy_h: So 2@C was @C's and a higher suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You get the kids - I'll take the house, etc etc|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mdgraham: almost certainly. The prefix "iene" means "wife of", so Petryliene=wife of Petryla|pg||

nt|rodvenn: a good fit and many top controls but few tricks|pg||
nt|pasker: likely to @S game i think andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe not|pg||
nt|bagman: Might be a spade game on @HK lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think you are right:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 3N?|pg||

nt|antoniz: studiowa³em Twoje ksi¹¿ki, bardzo starannie:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S are possible also without K@H lead, if South don't play @h but @D|pg||
nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3Nt is the best spot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||
nt|snetram:  szlemik w karo nie jest Åatwy do licytacji|pg||
nt|antoniz: po tym 1pik chyba niemo¿liwe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: 10/19 leads so far were @C leads, that's funny|pg||

nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think North should have bid 3@h on the last one, though|pg||

nt|sharkey: West opened 1@H canape OR so East was out unless wanted introduce @D suit Vul...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D sets spades as I think 4@C would be needed to confirm that 2@C was based on a natural club suit|pg||

nt|andyv:  W should pass this but hard to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It does|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bagman: South has two chances to play hearts before the elimination postion develops|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes and Fantoni made a killing at a NABC tourney in the US by playing 5 3N contracts holding 5-4 major suit fits... it was right every time!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pasker: safe lead from N|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "No bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was when Bas had written 12-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he corrected that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very poor slam; too much wasted in hearts|pg||

nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||

nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Next round in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Slovakia|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebanon v France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's not the best possible start...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snetram:  Moim zdaniem E powinien walczyc - 4NT|pg||
nt|bogier: Polki przegra³y Francuzkom 5 pik X w tym rozdaniu|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|antoniz: czemu nie przez kiery?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: running scores Group A    http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pasker: maybe versace could have chosen to play in @Ds instead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andy_h: In the Open Room, the Norwegian N/S pair had an uncontested auction to 3NT after North decided to reverse with 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make if guess @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, be back later, good night Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 70-68 isner|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bagman: Well guessed|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he makes for 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how he could do it|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|jtr: A close well-fought match|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: OMG!|pg||
nt|hedyg: will they ever stop?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: its over|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ryskiel_: Panie niestety poleg³y z frnacuskimi Madame narazie jest minus 20|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: still cant handle it all |pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer can get two diamonds the tricks he makes from trumps|pg||
nt|pasker: it is difficult to know when you don't know what 2m would have been over 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: In the end N might get endplayed but the contact is probably down at that time|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: ciao all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks, be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The TD's here now|pg||
nt|antoniz: a my 11 lew|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
nt|andyv:  When E denied @hs, maybe he shoudl have pulled 1N to 2@d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: I had to get a hyphen in during the session just to please DB|pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't notice it. Where?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks everyone|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: and a tie score 2nd half|pg||
nt|brolucius: A classy plus score by the Italians to end the session. |pg||
nt|bagman: It's seldom that at this level a pair stops in 3@H in an invitational sequence when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa played the "played card game" again|pg||
nt|sharkey: I understand Bas and the Dutch play Slovakia next game in football - so good luck to both teams :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D by Versace seam more effective after 1nt by Lauria|pg||
nt|pasker: W likely to make 3 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|bagman: A game should be bid  if its 33% or better|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s8|nt|andyv:  don't bet on those things!|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
