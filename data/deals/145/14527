mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|migry: Hi all :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|flash: we're in the Chicago suburbs for the last segment of the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|migry: this may be a small swing to welland if they get too high in the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team was originally seeded 20th out of 23 entering teams, a remarkable feat to be 15 boards away from the semis|pg||
nt|flash: the Weinstein team is certainly the surprise of the tournament|pg||
nt|migry: 1NT - 2@d - 2@h -2NT - whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hold shirts all,  N/S names will be entered when Matt has a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there they are |pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: ok im here everyone behave|pg||
nt|harmon: specially jacki|pg||
nt|Jacki: Ok then if I have to behave, I'm not doing this|pg||
nt|harmon: oh darn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: should be a quick 10 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Good Morning everyone from Chicago :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|flash: Weinstein-Garner (for Welland) vs Etter Kolesnik in the other room this segment|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely making 4 unless Sher does something silly  (which I doubt) |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back Phil, thanks for joining us|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Phil,  welcome |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|harmon: chance for a pickup 3n very lucky make|pg||
nt|harmon: as kib pointed out even 4s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|flash: we had 3 Weinsteins in play at this tournament|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: I think Fred will cash ak |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hello everyone, will try to get soem commentators asap, untill then, i will try and fill in the gaps|pg||
nt|joest:  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: good morning jack! welcome.|pg||
nt|joest:  these boards begn the second half of a 120 board two-day match in Chicago|pg||
nt|joest:  I just got here so will hold off commenting until the next hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sounds good jack :) thx|pg||
nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Etter in the tank on this one, Good morning Linda|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of those hand where you can make 6 on a good day so 4 is pretty safe even with a poor lie of the cards|pg||
nt|lml: he has to lead a club now and give up the @CQ|pg||
nt|lml: keeping a club|pg||
nt|lml: then if they take dummy in diamonds he ruffs high draws trump and has a club to get there|pg||
pc|cT|nt|phil: missed most of the last segment, but in the 2nd the wheels came off for Weinstein|pg||
nt|phil: hey SHirley|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: so he is going to make 4 in a jiffy|pg||
nt|lml: well a long jiffy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Seems etter was simply being extra thurough, don't want to start out the day going down in a cold one|pg||
nt|lml: absolutely|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: they (Weinstein)  made up some at the end |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Steadied the ship in the previous, picked up an imp on the total, now need to start makin some real headway|pg||
nt|sybarra: not impossible but difficult score |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: you want to make sure you have thought of everything|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|flash: we'll keep an eye on the 'run rate...'    Welland needs 17 IMPs in 15 boards|pg||
nt|lml: he can now ruff a heart for +1 |pg||
nt|lml: but that could be down 1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back everyone for the third segment :) will try and put on a good show here |pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: good morning Matt, Linda|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|lml: good morning|pg||
mc|10|nt|lml: so Etter took the safe path to make it|pg||
nt|lml: and ignored the overtrick|pg||

nt|phil: yes I had to leave with about 3 left in the 2nd - it was getting really ugly for them|pg||
nt|phil: working hard on the first few boards is a positive thing - I truly believe the brain needs to 'warm up' |pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+ !d 11-15|nt|lml: my own failing is the very last board ... I think I have mentally left most of the time by then|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: hiya Harmon, Weinstein had the wheels come off a bit last segment, this will be a key test to see if they can restore some momentum|pg||
nt|harmon: looks like|pg||
nt|harmon: it|pg||
nt|phil: also true|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: we had lots of slam hands in the previous set - this is the first one here|pg||
nt|harmon: lotsa bds left|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose that East has 11|pg||
nt|phil: liberally counted :)|pg||
mb|3S|an|Pre-emptive|mb|p|nt|Jacki: Welcome to our commentator Phil Clayton everyone :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Good morning Phil :)|pg||
nt|lml: but in their system it has not really promised diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: with 70 left, I wouldn't say 60 IMPs is nothing, but it is against a good team playing well, that had the benefits of rest|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|phil: Sher called it a 3@d opener|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobh1: dont think there's any way to make 7|pg||
nt|flash: for security reasons, each match has its own set of hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstien will need some hands to break their way and to "swing" on |pg||
nt|lml: that was an action double... I used to call it a responsible double|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: that doesn't allow for comparisons across matches, but avoids many and severe headaches...|pg||
nt|lml: I am doubling and you are responsible partner|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hi Jacki :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very odd to see that J weinstein Passed with 12 HCP and 5@h on the first board, led to them ending up in 4@s -1, not a dream start|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Moss upgrades a lot, but many would agree with not calling this a "17"|pg||
nt|phil: cant imagine anything but 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|phil: aka "Spike Lee" double (Do The Right Thing)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: roy thought 4n was quantitative|pg||
nt|bobh1: is that what chris intended?|pg||
nt|migry: it is quantitative|pg||
nt|lml: I guess if you open them that light you have to be prepared to play partscore with an opening bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: that would be the 'std' interpretation|pg||
nt|migry: they play 14-16 NT |pg||
nt|lml: opposite it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil: Im pretty sure what everyone plays, but I'll look up their cc's to make sure |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|migry: so 17 (even prime 17) is not enough to DRIVE to slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok forgot about their slightly lighter range|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: I don't think man would pass 4@D with the West hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: Gitelman / Moss cc: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=700&pid=223|pg||

nt|lml: I apologize now and in advance for typo's man=many in previous sentence|pg||
nt|phil: I thought it had some deep philosophical meaning.....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: 1@d = always unbalanced |pg||
nt|migry: so EW will open 1@C with balanced hands that contain a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not to mention light|pg||
nt|migry: this is sort of a normal opening|pg||
nt|phil: true; but the defense could have taken the club earlier and achieved that, but the position is murky to South at T3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|migry: and you want to get that suit in|pg||
nt|bobh1: for them you mean right?|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't be too happy if the opponents bid 1NT-3NT and take the first 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: this isnt right|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Usually at imps, you will be play safely for your contract - unless very sure it wil be ok to do otherwise|pg||
nt|phil: or maybe it is....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: for some reason people this week are questioning my input more than usual :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes,  4 @S might not be everyones bid|pg||
nt|phil: bonanza available in 4@s x'd here|pg||
nt|lml: the result should match the OR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|migry: i would be happy to open that one even when playing "semi solid" openings|pg||
nt|migry: 1@h= S|pg||
nt|migry: not sure Roy saw the double by North|pg||
nt|bobh1: what would 1@s by roy show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I think Diamond decided to use the favorable vulnerability to try and make life tough for N-S|pg||
nt|phil: hi Mini  :) |pg||
mb|4H|nt|migry: his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N bids and he did |pg||
nt|lml: years ago it used to be a debate about whether to open 1NT with a good 5 card major.  Now the debate is over |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
nt|phil: 2N feels like an underbid|pg||
nt|phil: 5@d looks normal, but with 2 big cards, and a stiff, isnt a pass tempting? |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: no high cards but his partner is bidding his head off|pg||
nt|scotty: N might have tried 3N there - but it's definitely tougher than if Diamond had passed and left N-S to bid their 26 HCP to 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be indeed |pg||
nt|phil: and the group that opened with the 5cM won|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: they have to guess the right lead here|pg||
nt|migry: good pass |pg||
nt|migry: east may try the KS and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|migry: A@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they will get it right but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he leads the @s A Roy will be able to give suit pref|pg||
nt|migry: i bet on the AS lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: how much pressure was pard under?  |pg||
nt|lml: more people have incorporate ways to find a 5 card major into their system and other dont care|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|scotty: There is a lot of risk and randomness associated with Diamond's action there - but here he must be credited with generating a swing out of nothing|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|phil: yes, playing various kinds of puppet stayman is sometimes used|pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: very costly at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: this was one no one was guessing he would lead|pg||
nt|phil: answer = not very when we are w/r|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|phil: a rare misstep for NS - they have been very strong for Weinstein|pg||
pc|h4|nt|phil: Im kind of surprised Platnick didnt raise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: the stranger notrump opening are with singletons|pg||
nt|lml: I am not used to that yet|pg||
nt|lml: and I think a void is right out|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: it is true that one triple four hands can be tough to bid though|pg||
nt|lml: there really is nothing much to think about on this hand.  You take a diamond play and make 4 or 5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|scotty: Well partner could have the same hand with a king less - and then game rates to be poor|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: he might have talked himself into 4 here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|scotty: Sorry - was thinking Platnick was South...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: now we are back at taking the diamond play... yawn for 5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cherilou: Hi all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|scotty: Platnick didn't raise because 1@d can be 2.  So with 3-cards in their suit, passing looks sensible - partner can reopen with short clubs|pg||
nt|phil: my point is sometimes the 1@d opener actually has diamonds, and from East's standpoint, 5@d may be cheap vs 4@s|pg||

nt|lml: you can see how east-west wind upin the spade game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 3 tables so far, all -1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: North responds light, so as not to give E-W a free run|pg||
nt|phil: I know Josh Sher very well, and this comment doesnt surprise me - he instantly takes the charge which keeps the esprit d' corps intact|pg||
nt|phil: unlucky - no 8 card fit for EW|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Lebensohl|nt|phil: vulnerabilty and position ripe for stealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I like to play redeouble here as "competitive values, with doubleton in your suit"|pg||
nt|phil: any explanation on the xx? just cards? |pg||
nt|phil: good agreement to have|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|scotty: E might bid 3@d now and West....?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i believe written as doubleton heart but writting is microscopic|pg||
nt|phil: pass by Sher would also reveal a good hand, right? |pg||
nt|lml: Hampson bid 3@H which got rid of the science|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the quick claim overwrote the lead here - it was a trump...|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h is Smolen|pg||
mb|3S!|an|Inv. w/ 4 spades|nt|lml: Diamond might get a plus ... wow|pg||
nt|phil: 3@s is probably invitational with 4 as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I would actually play that 2@s is a better hand for spades - but that is not "standard"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and smolen is 5 @s/4 @H  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: gotcha|pg||
nt|scotty: I'll be very impressed if Platnick passes here|pg||
nt|cherilou: E might sit for this|pg||
nt|phil: Michael, would you take the xx as a force beyond 2@s? |pg||
nt|scotty: Very difficult to "get" the opponents at the 2-level when they open and you are 3-3 in their suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: (pard bids his 4 card suit to get the 5 card suit played the nt hand if it can be played|pg||
nt|sybarra: one more try with 4 @D or 4 @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Not a force in any way|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: then I think Platnick's pass of 2@s is dangerous - now he has to play catch up|pg||
nt|phil: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: "on the way" |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I wonder if 3N was available as some sort of slam try - either serious or non-serious|pg||
nt|lml: I guess Platnick has too much to play the partscore vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no way for brian to pass 3@s with a 17 count, despite only having Q10x in @s for the double|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: I wouldnt have thought so |pg||
nt|lml: maybe Diamond can make it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil: by Moss|pg||
nt|lml: things are actually fairly friendly|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: Nickell now +76 vs Harris...   |pg||
nt|migry: "steaming"|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe not the best idea|pg||
nt|scotty: I wonder if Diamond was sure 4@d was natural?|pg||
nt|cherilou: what else would it be?|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't know, but he didn't raise.  He hadsn't shown any diamonds, and he (apparently) had shown a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|phil: like the last hand - a little NV action makes life tough for the pair with the cards |pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he thought it was a splinter - or was at least a little worried|pg||
nt|cherilou: perhaps it was just a @H honor|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the N-S NT range?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Fred saying,  thx but no thanks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe not good enough for Serious 3 nt |pg||
nt|phil: rightly or wrongly I believe that if you are staring at the @sAK and partner tries for slam, you have an obligation to reciprocate|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jfeld: Hello|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi jason|pg||
nt|jfeld: Does double imply a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|migry: certainly not a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i dont think its lead directing at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||
nt|jfeld: with every suit stopped, actually pretty reasonable, especially as he knows he needs to generate a swing|pg||
nt|phil: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i just looked at pad, i can confirm it showed 2 @H|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks Matt|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can make here, by eloping with club ruffs.  But this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: but what do you bid Phil?|pg||
nt|phil: or they might not play it when one partner opens NT|pg||
nt|phil: dunno; 5@c or 5@s has appeal|pg||
nt|phil: or 4@h as last train if available|pg||
nt|lml: lets say he plays three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|lml: now north south may cash their hearts|pg||
nt|lml: he is going to have to ruff the third heart high and run the @s10|pg||
nt|lml: probably that doesnt work|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: feels like -1, the @cJ should help control the tap|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: everything is right on this hand, but etter doesn't know it, considering various options as he can't afford to lose a trick in hearts|pg||
nt|harmon: probably still his best option|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: with spades 3-3 and diamonds 4-3, he can afford to knock out the A@c and bank on spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hedge his bet, etter is asking about carding methods to try and smith etc. to try and get a read|pg||
pc|s3|nt|harmon: yes but it looks like d's 5-2 with erics false card|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is last train,  but frankly I perfer something like jx for that |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: I meant 4 @H IF last train|pg||
pc|s4|nt|scotty: He doesn't rate to guess spades - N is almost a 2-1 favorite to hold the J|pg||
pc|sA|nt|phil: Ive never heard a good definition of it, but in this context it must mean, "I have the club control you are worried about, and I like my hand, but I can't move by myself"|pg||
nt|sybarra: best definition I ever heard |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|pc|sT|nt|scotty: S has an easy trump return - staying passive|pg||
nt|lml: this is obviously not going to work|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: does he need to guess spades, after A@h, @h? |pg||
pc|d4|nt|migry: i think it's very reasonable, knowing the suits don't break well for declarer|pg||
nt|jfeld: I'm getting many votes for both I've got everything sewn up, don't give anything away, and also lead a @h|pg||
nt|migry: i believe tha the double should ask for a @h here|pg||
nt|migry: north either has 3 hearts or 4 horrible ones- for me always 3|pg||
nt|jfeld: 3 for me too|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes most people rebid 2 @h with 6-4 even with a bad hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|scotty: S can be endplayed in trump to solve one problem - but tough to get everything right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|nt|scotty: He needs to lose no trick to @sJ OR @dQ - tough|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|phil: dummy is feeling the pinch a little too|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: making use of every entry to E hand|pg||

nt|flash: the difference when @Hs is the 2nd suit is that you may reach 4@H instead of stopping in 2@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you say the players are "arguing" about this Matt?|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks like a spade to the Q was an error, resulting in down - instead of a heart to endplay S|pg||
nt|lml: that seems to me to be a pretty normal result|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfj: roy felt misinformed in regards to his lead, feeling like if opps had a specific agreement that it showed 3@h|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|jfeld: and fortunately for Chris and Roy no overtricks, which is less likely after the invitational sequence, and his hand.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well we don't know who informed whom of what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: b4 the lead franco asked johnathan if that shows a 3 card accept with hearts, which was confimred, but, as 3nt would make anyway, they had no recourse|pg||
nt|scotty: Fair slam here for E-W - after the overcall, @sA is very likely onside, so you just need to find @dQ - about 57.5% a priori|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: agrressive bid by geoff at these colors|pg||
nt|phil: the even segments seem to be bad luck for Weinstein|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cherilou: not a good slam here but it happens to make with that old adage 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|harmon: eric expecting more|pg||
nt|phil: think Brad just blasts here with the double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In practice for an expert the odds in 6N are usually even better - you may get information to guide you when you play out the hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d is natual here, not a raise - as if West opened another suit (since 1@d can be short)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I am not sure he knows clubs "fit" yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: If E bids KC at some point, West COULD decide to show the trump Q - the fourth @d is big - he knows his partner is 5.  but it is a big risk|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: but looks like you are right |pg||
nt|phil: well, double is 'relative' :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5/5's are powerful |pg||
nt|phil: as long as 1@c isnt short, it represents a trick source|pg||
nt|phil: so Greco - Hamspon able to stop in 1N with 12 + 12 - not always an easy thing to do|pg||
nt|lml: 12-12 often makes game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jfeld: Interesting hand here with the bad breaks|pg||
nt|bobh1: entry management|pg||
nt|migry: i would call it a little ugly hand |pg||
nt|bobh1: it seems the defense can set up @hs|pg||
nt|migry: or i might call it interesting if i were English|pg||
nt|jfeld: don't see this making|pg||
nt|flash: interesting to defend; ugly to declare??|pg||
nt|migry: sounds more accurate|pg||
nt|phil: this smells like a stiff|pg||
nt|lml: and Etter thought the AQxx of diamonds was an upgrade (foolishly)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|harmon: good lie this makes too|pg||
pc|d7|nt|phil: ducking will lead to defeat with a diamond back though, but that may not be obvious either|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|phil: no weakness in any suit, but no big trick source either|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfj: 6@C -6 at the other table, wow.|pg||
nt|scotty: W was worried he had 3 losers and was willing to stop below game.  E figured that if his partner could do no more than 4@d, slam could not be that good|pg||
nt|phil: Kolesnik should bid 1N with a lot of balanced hands here, regardless of his diamond stop|pg||
pc|hT|nt|migry: although the defense is routine - establish your long suit, don't pitch winners|pg||
nt|flash: now, it's plug ugly...|pg||
nt|flash: rise and start @Cs to escape for down 2?|pg||
nt|migry: sounds like the best plan|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: yes but the diamond bid suggested to Etter that his AQ was worth AK|pg||
nt|lml: but since partner is already counting the K it wasnt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: a club back looks normal|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|phil: this looks like a smart line|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|phil: well game just needs a little luck in hearts and one of the black suits, and there are endgame positions too|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobh1: he heard you Jim|pg||
nt|scotty: With the result in the other room, slam is a REALLY bad proposition|pg||
nt|phil: draw trump and play a spade up - you just need one entry to lead toward the clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|flash: the defense has given up the @H suit on this line, but declarer still has no tricks|pg||
nt|jfeld: all roads lead to down 2 from here|pg||
nt|migry: the only problem is that they are slow roads|pg||
nt|flash: must be the flagman up by the construction area...|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they were vulnerable it would be even slower|pg||
nt|migry: anyway, i can se the time to give u a very useful advice|pg||
nt|jfeld: :)|pg||
nt|migry: do NOT eat chinese while you commentate|pg||
nt|migry: or anything with sauce/rice|pg||
nt|migry: i guess pizza would be best|pg||
nt|migry: however slow play is great for making coffee|pg||
nt|jfeld: I have to go, but enjoy and be sure to check out our new website: www.bridgewinners.com for regular updates and a convention card editor|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like the luck is with east west this is very close to making but doesnt quite|pg||
nt|lml: Diamond does have to hold onto clubs though but the opening bid should help|pg||
mc|9|nt|lml: you don't often see a hand where the @C is a key card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: kolesnik just made a false claimwhich they accepted|pg||
nt|lml: @c5|pg||
nt|phil: well thats interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: before starting the next board however, Brian was like, hey wait a minute...|pg||

nt|scotty: You might think E was crazy to pass 6@c in the other room after W opened 1@d, but I think not|pg||
nt|phil: some interesting hands this set|pg||
nt|lml: so they figured it out|pg||
nt|phil: no director call Matt? |pg||
nt|lml: its scored as down 1 |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|lml: on BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no, kolesnik realized he only had 8 tricks, so accepted the contest from platnick|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+ !d 11-15|nt|flash: 10 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: E was thinking his partner was 4-4 in minors, and could discard a heart loser on the 5th @d if he played in the 4-4 club fit|pg||
nt|cherilou: opening 4@H would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 48  3nt for n/s in the other room |pg||
nt|phil: 6@c looks like a peeler, but theyll get plenty of action along the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1@c= either natural or balanced|pg||
nt|scotty: W was a little sleepy when he bid 6@c, I think.  Not sure what he was thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team began play last Friday, and it seems Baseggio and Wesintein play a majority of the boards, fatigue certainly an issue with the grueling schedule|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Fred will bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|phil: I suppose but 2@h didn't help his hand one iota|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the X by N (should included spades)  will he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards always do the same thing |pg||
nt|phil: peeler - cold, icy - as is 7@c as was just pointed out to me (correctly)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: 1@d= heart|pg||
nt|scotty: now there is an interesting question of 5@h or pass then 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: bid my singletons or void |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S going slowing,  can S bid 3 @S?|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h might be clearer |pg||
nt|phil: 4@s indelicate, but reaching this slam is tricky after the 1@d opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but its hard to say how good this is|pg||
mb|4N|nt|scotty: Of course here, S will bid 5@h if N passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if N puts in a 4 @C bid,  I think they n/s are off to the races,  as S will cue bid spades |pg||
nt|phil: personally, I think you need to keep a 2@d overcall as natural, and use something else (like 2@h) as Michaels|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobh1: presumably 1@s would imply better @cs|pg||
nt|migry: west could have bid 1@s to show 4-4 or 5-4 - 1@h shows a balanced minumum|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|sybarra: 4 @C by South  (I am going to quick guessing soon)  ..|pg||
nt|phil: well, credit the 2@s call for a lot of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the lead gives Roy a chance?   @C lead into the opening bid too tough??|pg||
nt|phil: Sher is looking at a few spade losers and a club suit he doesnt know is running|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: well done|pg||
nt|lml: it was easy it seems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: 1@s just shows an unbalanced hand - nothing about club quality|pg||
nt|sybarra: and credit is due to 2 @S |pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: Etter perhaps expected one more spade but the @dQJ make up for it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: but needed to play @Ss to take a couple pitches??|pg||
nt|flash: North back to same position as opening lead - @C or @HK to get rich; pointed suit no good|pg||
nt|phil: Kolesnik would like to claim, but can't - a@d void isn't likely but you never know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interestingly, in the Nickell match, on the previous board, Ralph Katz was in 6@d with north having bid a pre-emptive 2@s and thus misguessed the diamond suit for -1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|mc|12|nt|scotty: who was North?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a 23 imp swing, chip martel |pg||

nt|bobh1: i think their system hurt them|pg||

nt|sybarra: not being critical, but somehow,  just doesnt make much sense |pg||
nt|sybarra: however its a push!!|pg||
nt|phil: well you can construct South hands with the @cK, and six diamonds, where high levels are in danger I guess|pg||
nt|phil: but when clubs arent running|pg||
nt|phil: at the other table, Hampson was able to overcall 2@d, and Greco jumped to 3@s|pg||
nt|phil: maybe 2@s wasn't forcing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: N-S would like to reach 3N here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i would say likely yes|pg||
nt|phil: you shrug, put the hands back and have a friendly discussion in the bar later|pg||
mb|2N|nt|scotty: They have a big club fit, and each has some worries - S about spades, and N about both red suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, very likely will make 4@s on 18 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if W had just rebid 1n E would pass|pg||
nt|flash: Nickell by 76 with 8 boards left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: conservative pass by etter over 2@s, can't imagine he feels too comfortable, altho not the best hand in the world|pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: not everyone's style, but I like a 2@s opener as dealer w/r|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT will mostly likely be the spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bobh1: the other room was 2@d -1|pg||
nt|lml: in 4 bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: x= 4 or more spades 1S=3 cards|pg||
nt|scotty: I think Diamond should risk 2@s there.  He has a powerful playing hand, and might have game even facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: needs a trump lead to set it it looks like|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think south can envision a hand with few or no hts with N,  and S has no @S's,  doesnt a trump contract make sense?|pg||
nt|phil: modern treatment - a forcing 2@s call|pg||
mb|3N|nt|migry: yeah sry was lookig  at this one|pg||
nt|scotty: when you have a void, especially in their suit, you need to be much more aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: looks like Nickell - Fleisher in one semi-final|pg||
nt|phil: no argument from me on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but he's aceless and Hamman's rule beckons|pg||
nt|sybarra: again, not a criticism or resulting (I hope)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: interestingly, in this hand 2@s might have allowed josh to bid 2nt which jackson would surely raise? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffing hearts seems safer than trying to work on the diamond suit, but he has a few options here|pg||
nt|phil: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agree with you last comment Phil |pg||
pc|c4|nt|scotty: Seems asif N should do more here.  Partner's 2@s showed a maximum with shape, and he rates to have a stiff heart (even though he doesn't here)|pg||
nt|phil: 2N might be some kind of asking bid to clarify 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Hamman's rule= if you can play 3 nt do so |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|phil: but @hKTx is certainly a deterrent, and the @sA is a defensive card too|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Greco led a club honor to maximize the overtricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond jokingly plays the six :x |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: I am told that Meckwel bit the slam on bd 51|pg||

nt|sybarra: :)  and you had to remind us?|pg||
nt|phil: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: Moss hiding the ball a little with the @c8|pg||
nt|lml: which if it holds will give Weinstein their first imp|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: but with the 4-1 trump split those losers arent hiding anywhere|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: indeed, the agressive 2@s overcall seems to have paid off, max pressure on the opponents|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|scotty: I'm not sure what the continuations are, but 2N looks wrong with no red suit cards and no tenace - unless there was no other choice.  3@s showing @s value would have been ideal |pg||

nt|sybarra: there are 12 imps for Weinstein |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can n/s make 3 nt, or will the ht lead kill it ? |pg||
mb|2C!|an|6+ !c 11-15|nt|bobh1: this is not a 1n opening?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yea, seems odd to inquire w/ an inv ranged hand, and simply give up when u find no heart fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|phil: so the club lead did let in 4@h at the other table |pg||
nt|phil: as it should I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry for the mistype, my keyboard is playing tricks :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting alert,  I thought is looked like a "mulit" type 2 @D |pg||
nt|phil: another liberal 11, but Platnick is in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|migry: 1NT = 14-16 , probably east decided to upgrade|pg||
nt|bobh1: upgraded maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get to 3 nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D is multi-type|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yes, that is correct, i believe sher elected not to make a systematic bid|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C would have been okay too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: N pay bid it now |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: showing 6-7 w/ an x|pg||
nt|phil: reasonable game at IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: vulnerable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Because W happens to have ALL the @d honors, you end up being safe in 4@s from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 9 toppers here on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: yes I think Brad and Fred play a sort of 'Woolsey' over a strong club|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see ak of hts and a ht  cashed here|pg||
nt|phil: 2M - that and a minor, 2@c = majors, etc..|pg||
nt|ritong: i strongly suggest you don t ask them " do you play woolsey?", phil|pg||
nt|phil: this feels like a really good stop|pg||
nt|phil: BJ Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: hi:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Henri @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfj: K@h w/ the opening bidder, not too bad at all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|flash: who, if anyone, was supposed to X?|pg||
nt|migry: nobody|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: may see ace and a spade now |pg||
nt|phil: well, 3-1 trump might create an issue, so I dont think its quite that good|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: well this will work alo |pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|scotty: You can kind of play either opponent for @dA to be secure.  But if W had @dA and E has QJ, you could not|pg||
nt|scotty: After eliminating black suits, I mean, of course|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mslair: 5d was inspired  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|flash: another contribution from Bartlett's   :)|pg||
nt|phil: small point - if anyone has @cJxxx its West - he probably wouldnt lead a trump with a stiff @c|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|scotty: still, W is more likely than E to hold @dA - he might have led a @d from QJ9x(x)|pg||
nt|phil: oh my|pg||
nt|scotty: good point, phil|pg||
nt|cherilou: they're fine with just the 2 of them|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|phil: so a mombine of 2-2 trump +K on side or 3-3 hearts and K on, plus a few crumbs for JT doubleton, or something else weird|pg||
nt|phil: (combine)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: yea. various goodies to hope for :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil: and obviously with an opening "bid" on your right its better than 50%|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|phil: the K on|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: its pretty close but thins are not going the Weinstein way|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: the 2@C bid may suggest too that things are breaking all that well|pg||
pc|d4|mc|9|nt|phil: Fred has a Hobsons choice - set up the diamond or break clubs|pg||
nt|lml: down 1 and a more imps for Diamond who have been on the right side of all these game choices|pg||

nt|phil: when it rains it pours|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht lead was really no threat as pointed out by kibbers|pg||
nt|phil: and we are back to an even set just like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Weinstein continues creeping back |pg||
nt|sybarra: evan split for this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: or segment|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: I guess I dont understand the rush in trying to guess hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: inspired or not it could be a swing for welland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: Meckstroth also went down in 4@s playing a diamond up b4 eliminating clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: He took a 75 % play - but @d to K was about 81% - that small added chance of W having @dAQJ came home|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost want to get in early with the S hand |pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein needs to make some action smehow if they are to get back into this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @H probably some stayman treatment |pg||
nt|phil: fearless 1@s r/w in 3rd|pg||
nt|sybarra: but better judgement prevailed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: yeah vulnerability is great for a preempt, but suit quality and 2nd seat are not|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 12 IMPs on 112...   46 IMPs with 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|mslair: and will be|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they are running out of room|pg||
nt|phil: bridge in the 21st century - you hold 22 real and the bidding starts 1@h - pass - 1N in front of you|pg||
nt|scotty: Eric Greco just pointed out, quite correctly, I think that I was wrong this whole time....|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Declarer's play also succeeds if West has both high hearts - so only THREE finesses losing is fatal - and that's 87.5%|pg||
nt|phil: he told me that too - so I am ready to take my foot out of my mouth - or at least consider it more :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|phil: lebensohl (or variant) probably|pg||
nt|phil: 86 down with 51 boards left  |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|scotty: Diamond could have doubled there to say "don't lead my suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is easy |pg||
nt|phil: 4-5 back to Weinstein Im guessing|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|scotty: With his spade holding, he is not that interested in a club ruff|pg||
nt|scotty: This is a pretty good but unlucky slam|pg||
nt|lml: these deals have not been helpful if you want to catch up... not many swings to work with|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfj: Willenken "allright roy, u better play the ____ out of this"|pg||
nt|bobh1: chris accepts with all of his extra values|pg||
nt|migry: 3NT is a "state of the match" bid |pg||
nt|bobh1: well he has 3 tens|pg||
nt|migry: you can't win when u r down 50 with 5 boards to go by playing 2S |pg||
nt|flash: with the location of the @S honors, it's also probably a last gasp...|pg||
nt|scotty: N may feel @dA is enough to bid slam here|pg||
nt|lml: and its hard to win imps by not bidding games|pg||
pc|c7|nt|migry: and i'm sure chris knows he's not winning this match|pg||
nt|scotty: And then Diamond will make a lighner double - against SLAM he definitely wants a club lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: caught|pg||
nt|phil: sort of like a poker player with 20-25 big blinds - not desperate, but you need to start mixing things up some|pg||
pc|cK|nt|migry: unless they pick up some (a lot) of imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond actually thought about doubling five spades, unfortunately for sher, he could not see that due to the screens|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 of hts next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry 10 of @D I meant|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|scotty: It's nice to sometimes be able to think without giving away info to an opponent - screens do that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|scotty: Platnick was all set to lead his stiff in partner's suit - now he's thinking|pg||
nt|scotty: He may figure that, even if club void is more likely, if partner's void is in clubs his club holding might help beat slam even if he leads a @d.  Whereas if partner's void is in ...|pg||
nt|scotty: @d, not leading one is very likely fatal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: otherwise, time quickly becomes your enemy|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ritong: either he hops @c ace and a trump trick disappears, or he does not and a @s trick disappears|pg||
nt|phil: or he could place a low @d on the table and hope|pg||
nt|ritong: although the second trump trick was not official|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|scotty: Disappointment for Diamond - but relief when he sees @sA in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at those club spots!!!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|flash: Diamond awaits the winner; same schedule from here on out...   4 segments per day; 120-board matches|pg||
nt|scotty: This will be 17 more to Diamond team - and an astonishing 64-0 over 5 boards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobh1: the inspired 5@d bid picked up 12 or so imps|pg||
nt|mslair: minus 690?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 8 against the result in the other room but 4@s wasn't doubled there|pg||
nt|mslair: 450  can't get dbled after the strong 1n.t opening |pg||
nt|phil: other than Linda and Ray Lees blogs :), here is an excellent one: http://thegargoylechronicles.blogspot.com/ written by Philip Martin|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: and N is endplayed already |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|phil: a few months ago he went through a match and switched places so he had to recover a lot of IMPs against Jack, a computer bridge player|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|phil: he had this advice when behind - take reasonable, but "different" views than the other table|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure if we pick that one up|pg||
nt|lml: I will check it later.  We pick up a lot of blog feeds|pg||

nt|ritong: this one is favorable|pg||
nt|migry: they can make a 19 pts 4@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew have a thin game here|pg||
nt|bobh1: and they're vulnerable|pg||
nt|phil: well a good surge, but at this rate they will catch Diamond - by Wednesday of next week|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so some imps could swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: qx was the key,  but how did he know  (so much easier for us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will not help Weinstein |pg||
nt|phil: lots of people dont even know about these resources - but Im happy to help spread the word|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfj: not sure of NS 2nt range, but if 20-21 worth an upgrade?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: probably ns will compete to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe see a 4 @H bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: although it goes down |pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: 3@c = lead director / fit? |pg||
nt|phil: never mind ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: would be nice "on the way bid" |pg||
nt|phil: except for the opening bid ;)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but on the way to what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will sound like a "cue fit"|pg||
nt|phil: well you dont know what is lurking on your left |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: exactly - should be a value raise to 3@d|pg||
nt|lml: yes it takes a village|pg||
nt|phil: sure|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know if that means anything but it sounds good|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps here's an example|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In the other room, East could have made life more difficult for N-S by overcalling 3@s.  His 2@s gave them no problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: over a strong 1@c in the other match, and a 3@s overcall, the bidding proceeded double, p 3nt, p 5nt, p 7nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: so yea, 2@s often does nothing it seems :)|pg||
nt|scotty: So they solved the problem, but I doubt if they were as secure as Fred and Brad, who got to KC and find out his partner had 3KC + @dK |pg||
nt|phil: which isnt too far off, but isnt showing clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pard should hit the deck in 3 @D |pg||
nt|phil: many play 2@d as 'wide ranging' after pard has passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: good agreements are useful here - I think its fine to play transfers over 3@s|pg||
nt|phil: 3N looks 'obvious'|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: tsk tsk|pg||
nt|bobh1: or then again...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|phil: I think Josh will try for 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: sher took him seriously |pg||
pc|s6|nt|flash: seems as though the towel has been tossed into the ring...|pg||
nt|migry: yep|pg||
nt|flash: so, before everyone disappears...    thnx to Matt Meckstroth, our operator, for a great job|pg||
nt|phil: but if you are trying to create a little action, wouldnt you like pard to play it, or look into 5 of a minor, etc.?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|flash: and to our commentators for guiding us through the set|pg||
nt|sybarra: some suggest S bid 4 @d  "on the way"|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobh1: great job matt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: at least one too high |pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil: I think it makes on a club led|pg||
nt|phil: never mind|pg||
nt|phil: I must be tired, sorry|pg||
nt|phil: I think it does|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it makes on a @c lead, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i think our favorite club players might try and set up two pitches on the clubs even :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: I like the bid better if Partner is limited|pg||

nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for events and local times|pg||
nt|flash: we hope to see you again tomorrow and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The further the Weinstein team advances, the better i feel, they were the only team we beat in the round robin phase :)|pg||
nt|scotty: It is often profitable to preempt against strong artificial openings - opponents have less room to determine their fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand |pg||
nt|lml: yes I dont like that bid much|pg||
nt|phil: I even play it as a preemptive diamond raise with one pard that doesnt want to bypass 3N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 8 imps per board is not impossible if you get swingy hands|pg||
nt|phil: a tough game..cruel too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe n/w should be pards,  and e/s |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that's right you called it tough |pg||
nt|phil: a lot of 4333's this set|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: doesnt 4 @S look makeble here for e/w |pg||
nt|lml: there is an argument for open the South hand and I think most players would have done it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the @D's flop nicely for  e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: you also need a fighting spirit which apparently is not junior's currently|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @H's sit well,  |pg||
nt|phil: so, is double here support? |pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: Nickell +73 with 5 boards left|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@d probably "at least 1 4-card M"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely 3 nt here |pg||
nt|phil: I vote its off over natural 1N overcalls, but on elsewise|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I look maybe it doesnt \|pg||
nt|phil: whatever your runout structure is, it should probably apply here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: alot of illegible writting, so something other then supp|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I vaguely remember a Spingold match at Chicago in 05 (?) where a team was down by about 80 after 32, but lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does 6 @D make"|pg||
nt|sybarra: if I know these players, they not only write small, they write with light pencils, so you can barely see it |pg||
mb|3C|nt|migry: 6@d is interesting and makeable if you get the spades right|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have thought 4@c was gerber|pg||
nt|bobh1: for me it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only with the right view on spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: Matt,  what do you think,,  maybe e/w cant handle it all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, on an 8 card fit, it's possible i suppose :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: looks like 5 realistically|pg||
nt|sybarra: (at leas that was what I remember as operator)|pg||
nt|phil: Linda, what do you think the modern range is for a 4th seat weak 2? I've heard two different answers and both were adamant|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mslair: 4h must be last train|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that if east declares @ss, the @d singleton leads is disastrous for NS|pg||
nt|phil: Hampson / Greco got to 4@c but it required Hamspon to wade out to the 4 level over a 3@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as cards sit  3 nt probably better but E knows he is getting a club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: greco was not happy with his pass "Hope ur not too good pard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: not sure how they play it - i think it's just a normal splinter|pg||
nt|phil: I confess I'd probably pass South, but two aces sway me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and worried about the enties maybe to W hand|pg||
nt|lml: I like to have 6 tricks at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lml: I would pass east's hand|pg||
nt|phil: range? |pg||
nt|lml: if my suit was good say 9 AKQ10xx or something|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|scotty: Having escaped a heart lead, declarer must still worry about losing 3 spades, a diamond, and a club|pg||
nt|phil: yes, I think I'd pass too, especially with a pard that loves to open light|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: but Greco knew that Hampson had the rounded suits|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: I would like a touch of shape but up to a weak opener|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: so try to avoid diamonds into South - and hope the @hA is there too? |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: wow... :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfj: specifically a void splinter explained|pg||
nt|passell: yes surprised Willenken didnt get in with 2 hearts last hand  especially behind |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: that should cause roy to devalue his max|pg||
nt|ritong: or reopen|pg||
nt|passell: 6dia  was the spot here with 2 hearts unable to be cashed|pg||
nt|migry: not quite|pg||
nt|mslair: would have to guess the spade|pg||
nt|migry: u need to finesse the spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: a strange play|pg||

nt|phil: the other match is tied 46-46|pg||
nt|phil: looks like 7 back to Diamond|pg||

nt|phil: this is one of the biggest 15 board segments I ever remember|pg||
nt|scotty: I was once down 117 to Brachman after the first day, and we got it back to single digits - but we still lost|pg||
nt|phil: both erred|pg||
nt|lml: I called losing concentration|pg||
nt|lml: you have to stay focused the whole match|pg||
nt|lml: when I play a match like this when I leave the room I am completely wiped.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: This team has played in an underdog role for 7 days now, very exhausting, understandable fatigue is setting in|pg||
nt|lml: if you arent you are not concentrating enough|pg||
nt|phil: very difficult to when down a bunch to a great team|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong 16+ Artificial|nt|Vugraphzfj: :) i try not to voice my predictions too much, otherwise i'd owe too many free cokes|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt made on bd 39 in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  |pg||
nt|lml: yes they have done awesome|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but that is what you have to do to win... you have to find it|pg||
nt|lml: you have to bring it as they say|pg||
mb|1S!|an|5+ !s GF|nt|sybarra: late here for cokes.  think I will take the cocktails|pg||
nt|phil: yes, obviously this team has over-achieved - I doubt you can find many examples of a greater run by a team that came in seeded so low|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: how did you get it back? steady bridge or taking reasonable, but slightly different positions? |pg||
mb|1N|an|!|nt|sybarra: 3 @H a spade raise,  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry everyone, internet gave out, back live |pg||
nt|sybarra: re Matt |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: They were the better team against two powerhouses Meltzer and Welland, earned their victories without a doubt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|!|nt|Vugraphzfj: On any given sunday* :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|!|mb|p|nt|phil: Sher and Greco essentially had the same decision over the 1N rebid|pg||
mb|3D|an|!|nt|phil: I have been a victim of this thinking myself, but there's a certain sense of "wow, we have really come far, we have exceeded our goals and then some" and then start to play sloppy ...|pg||
nt|phil: bridge|pg||
nt|phil: but the mistakes you make in a match like this will haunt you for months - or longer|pg||
nt|lml: they will do better next time.  they will know they can do it|pg||
nt|lml: I hope they can playing and build on this|pg||
nt|phil: yes they will be brimming with confidence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this layout is not great for declarer |pg||
mb|3H|an|!|nt|sybarra: does Brad lead the pedestrian ht |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Sher bidding the total tricks, but it looks pushy with a defensive 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Looks like no way to avoid losing 2 @d and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer likely to play 6 @D,  hiding his low cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 |pg||
nt|ritong: we all would be happy to be in 4@s i guess|pg||
nt|lml: they did get the worse of the luck this set|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|passell: got the wrong hand on lead  when it rains it pours|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: NV? no thanks|pg||
nt|phil: in fairness they did|pg||
mb|4C|nt|phil: this example included, although this is exactly the time to bid a slam needing a finesse (and a little more)|pg||
nt|lml: do you understand this auction.  After the forcing club and the positive spade they are doing some relaying |pg||
nt|phil: honestly I don't |pg||
nt|lml: well no doubt have found the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this slam is actually less than 50%|pg||
nt|phil: I can tell you Sher / Jackson play a more traditional version of Precision, so their auction is self evident|pg||
nt|lml: but on a good day it makes|pg||
nt|phil: definitely a state of the match slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|phil: swap NS and it rolls home|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|scotty: 3@c would have been touch and go on a trump lead - probably would have made|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lml: if you use keycard you might not get there off two keycards|pg||
nt|lml: in hearts of course|pg||
nt|lml: playing in diamonds in worse than hearts really because you still need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lml: you dont have enough tricks without the heart suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: after much deliberation, a shoulder shrug and a pass :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil: 1N isnt playing like a dream mind you|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the Club Brad's first choice? |pg||
nt|lml: so the bridge luck gods stay with Diamond|pg||
nt|phil: agree  - with the entry situation, you cant pick up 4-1 hearts anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: who will be quite happy when the heart finesse fails|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: so I would think the swing machine will be up and running in the next segment|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|bobh1: their system of transfer responses has backfired on them a couple of times|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: very possible the next segment could be a bridge renditon of "Custard's last stand"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|migry: they also gained some|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil: curious push|pg||
nt|phil: I think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|scotty: Now E will be endplayed in @d for down 1|pg||
nt|phil: or 300? :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i'd say their odds are slightly better than that  :p|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: but if South covers the first diamond, declarer may not be able to get back to draw the last trump|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes i actually think its kind of random|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps a glimmer of light for Weinstein|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 41 was indeed 3 nt in the other room |pg||
nt|phil: well they held of Xerxes for a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: lots of advantages|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+ HCP artificial|nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry, accidentaly redealt the same board :)|pg||
nt|phil: it looked oddly familiar|pg||
nt|lml: the score in the other match is about 7-3 or something.  These hands were not good for swinging at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: it would be nice to get a little momentum for the next few boards going into the next set|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7 HCP|nt|bobh1: the advantages are more in the extra auction possibilities it creates|pg||
nt|scotty: Light opening likely to propel E-W to 3N.  If S leads a low heart, it makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: made even with the club lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: and I was about to lay long odds Jackson would take more tricks in 1N :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|21+ hcp|nt|migry: correct|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so much in the lead placement|pg||
nt|migry: and then some|pg||
nt|bobh1: when lefty intervenes the transfers help them more with lead placement|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: in competition the transfers are so much better than bidding naturally|pg||
nt|migry: but also in uncontested autions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Weinstein seems to have effectively controlled the bleeding, making a little reboudn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: helps |pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: and why wouldnt he? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: well this doesnt look like much fun, does it? |pg||
nt|ritong: it looks ugly|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Some might have acted over 2@d with S - either double or 2@h is possible (i think 2@h is preferable between those choices)|pg||
nt|phil: but its quite likely Weinstein will open the E hand 1N and also get to 3N from the other side|pg||
nt|scotty: there is a pretty good case for leading a high heart here.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: some where n/s are going to find the spade shift |pg||
nt|phil: Josh will |pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Or a high spade!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: same lead both rooms|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|scotty: High heart can gain against opponents Jx And if partner has JX, you have the entries to recover|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|phil: declarer is not taxed with the heart break and diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lml: there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: more interesting on a passive lead|pg||
nt|lml: not taxing at all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil: 4@s anyone? |pg||
nt|phil: after 5 hearts and two diamonds, declarer would need to exit hand with something|pg||
nt|phil: all roads seem to lead to 9|pg||
nt|phil: except a low club and club back maybe|pg||
nt|phil: Platnick leads the J - why? A: he doesnt want a cover|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|phil: but I think Etter should  which he does|pg||
nt|phil: and is sagely ducked|pg||
nt|phil: so a few more to Diamond for the uptricks|pg||
nt|lml: he ducked so many times its strange he would cover here|pg||
nt|lml: there is no position I can think of that would make it right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: mad scramble for 1 nt here |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|phil: I would assume A asks attitude and its logical to encourage with Jxxx (they play udca)|pg||
nt|scotty: Since East denied 4-card hearts, I see no advantage in the trick 2 low heart shift, as opposed to high heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: was wondering...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a trick (may 2) short of 1 nt so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but only 50's |pg||
nt|phil: Fred trying to steal his diamond trick before the spade tsunami|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of H! should suggest the spade |pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|phil: I think it comes down to how many tricks you don't mind conceding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|phil: I have to leave for a meeting - enjoyed this and thanks Michael|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry, was lulled to sleep by north :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 of @H  |pg||
nt|lml: I think it ends the hand quicker and that may be the plan right now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: last trick for Fred coming up  if he play k of hts |pg||
nt|phil: about now you want to turn your cards over and say, next|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Not only should there be enough information, it's his only option :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jackson can even play the 8 of @H next |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade, indicating the club in S hand  |pg||

nt|sybarra: and you start at what time tomorrow Matt?|pg||
nt|phil: so yeah, covering is probably a bad idea|pg||
nt|lml: if declarer has Jx and you cover he might go wrong I suppose|pg||
nt|phil: so the lead eclipses 100|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: What's your theory on 2 suited hands in the pre-emptive HCP range, at what point do u upgrade to 1@h instead of 2@h here shirley?|pg||

nt|ritong: with a possible swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember folks they have 60 more bds tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Most North's, had they started with 5-card @s, would have pitched one at some point - so the position is actually guessable - pitch spade, @dAK, spade to dummy, @d to N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not impossible to overcome this deficit but not easy either|pg||
