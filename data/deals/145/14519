nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kiwi_joker: Madala in a comon position for us all .. not want to sell out to 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Shirley, Bill and Mike|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: And Roland :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are set |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And hello to Bas too|pg||
nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: S needs to shift to @H else @S finesse will protect @HK and will make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: This all assumes that defense do not cash hearts first|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bagman: This works fine but exposes the @SK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodvenn: the right shift,only it did not work|pg||

nt|capercliff: they may take a bit longer than usual for this match:) I am sure they were looking forward to playing the Italians?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|atabey: is this table playing first or they play simultanously?|pg||
nt|sybarra: South is a "she" for eveyone's info |pg||
nt|sharkey: why didnt he let @C9 hold the trick?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mbruun: Hi all|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Do they actually use it as the Icelanders do?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, Duboin can tell that South will not hold the @SK as well as the values shown. Otherwise he would have responded. A text-book example of reading the cards. Well done.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sorry, of course Sementa was declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone and welcome to Ostend in Belgium|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Sorry about the delay|pg||
nt|mbruun: Italy has not been as dominating as they usually are in this event, but they are still my favourites for the title|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mathias|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hey|pg||
nt|henryb:  slovakia just scored on Italy|pg||
nt|xenya: first blood to Italy -- in the OR 4@H was declared by S|pg||
nt|brolucius: But, er... I'm sure Duboin would also have made it, had he been declarer. |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR S showed both M over opening 1@C bid and NS bid the @H game for 11 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|atabey: board 1 was a push. after a 1@s opening|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D opening by EW, would show a strongish balanced hand.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand for N/S ... actually 6@C is a good contract, but it might not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a web site for these trials? |pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 D on a clubfinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: or this tourney |pg||
nt|hedyg: Piper showing a lot of respect for the 7-4 hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asked me to tell him when anything would happen Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 18-19 balanced yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: unfortunatley Scotland do not have a team in South Africa|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He's not looking too pleased|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rodvenn: yes. Boye transferred first to spades and then bid hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I wouldn't consider it with Jxx and Qxxx M anyway, even if I could open weak 2, would you?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine there being a banner on www.eurobridge.org|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: NS seem to be a tad agitated...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 9 tricks not imemdiately visible|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and nothing to play for in the red suits .. so see this drifting -1|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks Roland Good morning people|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Hey David, Roland :) Welcome all!|pg||
nt|jtr: Gazzilli auction here|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoi Bas|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like a normal 3rd seat 1 @d opening to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Bas |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C puppet stayman?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: I have been having inexplicable connection problems and hope that all will go well.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|atabey: not anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: GM DB9|pg||
nt|bagman: The ruff wil come with trump trick and the club can be later discarded on the diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|s9|nt|jtr: Your email has probelms too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: I have noticed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Life was not meant to be easy...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has no choice anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
mc|10|nt|bagman: Sure he had, diamond to Q and spade finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d???? and get ruffed?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy bid and made 4@H (+1) on the first board, for 11 IMPs.|pg||

nt|sybarra: can it be weak multi also?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, just a BAL hand just under 2NT opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am sure Duboin would swap 21-0 for 0-21 if it gave the Azzurri a late equalizer in yesterday's game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure, but he had an option and there was this restricted choice thing in spades|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon everyone|pg||

nt|paulg:  the old Precision 2@d opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: so would rest of Italy David :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Restricted Choice is even more powerful than normal when J-10-9 is a potential holding (three equal cards instead of two).|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Onside @C finesse would've helped a lot|pg||

nt|hedyg: go to http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm and click desired group on top of page|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Bill Frisby and George Holland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D the popular italian gadget to show strong-ish balanced, just under a 2nt opener|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this 4@S game is untouchable|pg||
nt|sharkey: the Vienna system which may still be used by some had 7-5-3-1 count David - 68 points in the deck|pg||
nt|hedyg: David are you implying that Lohay should have ruffed with the jack?|pg||
nt|brolucius: J-10, J-9 or 10-9 is three times more likely than J-10-9 (instead of the normal twice as likely).|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jtr: Quite a result  Doesnt look easy to make 12 tricks with the distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s was alerted... must be intermediate values?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer lacks entries for the double hook in diamonds, så with this fortunate lay-out, 12 tricks are possible. 4 H as the Italians reached is a decent spot as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: that might have worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: Sementa open the North hand on brd 1 and found himself in 3N|pg||

nt|brolucius: another coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am told there was a misdefence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator Bas van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|athene: some use 2@C for the same purpose|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Bas    good luck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine 3@C being Puppet Stayman after which LV reverse 3@H and 3NT|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Billand Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So 3@H denies 4/5M and 3@S is a puppet to 3NT after which N may offer minors|pg||
nt|daman: this is the par contract no matter the bidding|pg||
mb|6H|nt|atabey: zorlu assael open very light at this vul. so the invitation is strong|pg||

pc|c7|nt|bagman: Shabby trumps, unlikely to guess the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: can we switch to 6@c now?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The old volunteer for the color you submitted the high jump at ¶ 3 is invitational to you |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A Moysian (fit), for those who don't know, is a 4-3 fit named after the advocate of raising a 4cM opening with 3cM|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphznk: N had the slightest of pauses before playing @DQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: may just play the !'s right now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Here's another: For all the auctions bilateral spikes own color in a highly ³ ¶ you three and four are based on the fit ± colored partner (9 cards in the colors of bids) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spikes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||
nt|athene: with the spades wide open declarer can't get cute|pg||
nt|paulg:  he knows Piper has three or four hearts, and Wilkinson would not double with a singleton|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West ruffed one of dummy's top hearts (on Board 1). Declarer had only one discard on the 13th heart - for his losing club - and could not afford to ruff the diamond loser with ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: dummy's bare @SK because West would then score the @SQ.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: just cash your winners|pg||
pc|hT|nt|atabey: played wisely. could be complications if trumps were 4-2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||

nt|mbruun: Just kidding|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that 6@C would have failed also|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead not a big sucess that time|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- anything else might have made declarer sweat a bit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||

nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||

nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||

nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||

nt|hedyg: and Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Him and Roland.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: minors break badly tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||

nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||

nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|capercliff: i can assure you the other room will be longer, Ash and Goodman not known as speed demons|pg||

mb|2S!|an|3!S minum|nt|Walddk4: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|Natural|nt|hedyg: sry Tez|pg||
nt|paulg:  i played against them last Sunday in their final practice match and Wilkinson had the same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 2NT=GF bal. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, not surprised with the amount of Mafia Wars he plays on FB|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|3S|an|No 4!H|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
nt|bagman: N is likely to lead a heart whether W bids hearts or not; just for a different reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no insurance taken out|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid by charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure Madala's approach was right tactically|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
mb|4C|an|Cuebid|nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||
nt|jtr: But clearing the @ss seems right as you say|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday there was a similar auction where several Italian kibs claimed they don't play Puppet over 2@D openings|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think it showed 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one is not too trivial to play at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know...a hand that has NOTHING outside the @ss.....|pg||
nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||
mb|4D|an|Cuebid|nt|tez: nice lead|pg||
nt|daman: double partscore swing for Serbia on Board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|an|Cuebid|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|an|Superminimum|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no risks|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was all the more reason for North to lead a heart, looking for a ruff, because the Italian auction had been confident - including some cue bids.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||

nt|brgpro: normal|pg||

nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: NS may have missed chance of +800 ..but got +850  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Are you saying Pass is forcing? :P|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  when it goes pass pass... yes your pass is now forcing... and no one else can bid:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play diamonds before spades, hoping to set up a spade discard on the @DK-Q.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jtr: although 3@d might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: X= good hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I asked him after the claim and he said 9|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: No, he took @DK and heaved a sigh of relief|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have (reasonably) ducked the 2nd @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: 5@ds, 4@s and 1@c|pg||
nt|capercliff: playing the K was bound for going off if they were not breaking, ducking was the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some would bid 3@H, a mini-splinter (which would give South much more information).|pg||
nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||
nt|tez: kandemir led @d at the other table..interesting now|pg||

nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suffered the connection problems that I mentioned 45 minutes ago. Obviously the exorbitant £17.99 that I pay for Boardband each month is not considered sufficient for a good ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: service.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know for sure that had N bid 3@s, S would have raised to 4, playing the principle of 5-8|pg||
nt|jtr: Entries to play @ss are a problem here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||

nt|athene: oh well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, they said -3 just before I entered the claim. Versace shielded his last couple of cards so I was going out on a limb|pg||

nt|sybarra: off the schneid |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where does that term come from?|pg||
nt|mbruun: The table has turned |pg||
nt|capercliff: N is worth at least a curtiousy raise even if 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: very lucky 4@s is not on|pg||
nt|hedyg: they played 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: not by much though|pg||
nt|brolucius: The four Italian goalkeepers are keeping a clean sheet at the moment.|pg||
nt|bagman: with solid hearts he should have gone up; with Qxxx missing the spade finesse is one of his chances to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs to Italy on 7. The Italians found the defence against 3NT. @HQ to the ace and a diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||

nt|capercliff: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2|pg||
nt|capercliff: it will be flat I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||
nt|bagman: ok the old trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bagman: S put lead to dummy to score the @CK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||

nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||

nt|capercliff: NO|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11 more to Italy on board 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace made 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, on imperfect defence -- spades were never led there|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: EW play 16-18 1NT, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I bet people didn't dare bully you in school ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Thanks anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: I cannot look at the running scores or I lose the N/S convention card. I expect a computer wizard could solve that problem but I only worked at IBM for 32 years.|pg||
nt|atabey: looks like a minor suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to be the only way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Advice for South?  2@S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that West hand looks almost like a weak two, despite the point-count |pg||
nt|mbruun: 2 Sp is reasonable, 1 Sp is an underbid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would just bid 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am an underbidder|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you mean they have no TV screens?|pg||
nt|brolucius: My wife and I will, of course, be watching on HD.|pg||
nt|bagman: Is there much left except X for south?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Impossible to bid I shud say...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If I miss the England bridge team clocking up a maximum, so be it.|pg||
nt|bagman: S might bid 1NT even lacking the stopper|pg||
mb|d|an|*|nt|brolucius: This deal will not make the front page of tomorrow's papers. An all-over-in-2 minutes 3NT contract.|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: If you right click and ask it to open the page in another window|pg||
nt|jtr: We really cant do without your research|pg||
nt|brgpro: X shows @h|pg||
nt|brgpro: very common nowadays|pg||
nt|brolucius: The teams are divided into two sections that each play a round-robin. The top teams will advance to a second round-robin, where they will not replay against opponents they have ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: already faced.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, people are asking me for Group B RS as well, but this laptop has no Flash player so I can't access the EBL website...|pg||
nt|jtr: As i said, in keeping with transfer responses|pg||
nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aren't you going to lose a lot of partscores if you pass 1@H with that North hand?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  watching online you would always think that Wilkinson is the old man of the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: thats trf to 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|daman: no way he passed 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The Open Room results are not being updated on my MOVIE, but I am told that... Iceland made 4@s in 8, and played 3NT+2 in 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'm being told they're not online anywhere...|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@d will be final contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Scuzi|pg||
nt|mbruun: I just dont like that pattern|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The textbooks say that you have one heart too many and one spade too few for a take-out double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wrote it myself in 1991|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But "those who can, do, those who can't, write the textbooks"|pg||
nt|capercliff: that is a funny Question, which one is the junior:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Do people still play a 16-18 NT? Apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What about Chandler's Ford, David?|pg||
nt|atabey: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: I must have the wrong convention card for NS.  It calls for 1@C opening on south's hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody forces Zorlu to anything|pg||
nt|athene: this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: ... Lavazza girls ... lol|pg||
nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, he had 2@D out of the box and on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought he had opened 1@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Is there some other method?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: The kibitzer who told me those scores must be psychic then.|pg||
nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/turkey/zorlu-assael.pdf|pg||
nt|mbruun: I would hesitate for 30 sec and pass. That shows 3343 and 15HCP in my system|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: I thought that range died in the 60's|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, I was referring to group B running scores :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you allow them more room in tricky, complicated situations, it can work out very well when they get their shoelaces tangled up|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|atabey: I got some info from specs. they play 2@s min. with 3 cards. but then 2@c doesnt make sence|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|othered1: That's the card I have and it says you open 1@C with balanced hands without 5M or 6@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand more for technique than anything else|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you do with 3334?|pg||
nt|mbruun: 31|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 45 seconds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: The scores we have at top left on this screen have been static for a while and do not seem to incorporate recent comparisons.|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|Vugraphznk: Forgot the :) again Mathias :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceblue: because they prefer GF 2NT rebid :)|pg||
nt|daman: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: not that E-W in the other room got tangled up, exactly - but they just didn't bid their cold game|pg||
nt|daman: now has to lose 3@Ssw|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|athene: this was always likely|pg||
nt|athene: even getting the heart away wasn't enough to make the game - declarer had to drop the club too to have a chance|pg||
nt|athene: and no reason to do that really|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Maybe he didn't forget it|pg||

pc|sT|nt|bagman: there are 2 minor suit tricks to lose |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: The problem with playing 16-18 is that you have a too-large 12-15 point range underneath. You cannot closely define that range with a 1NT rebid.|pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, you could argue that both N/S's bid correctly - one after the 1@H opening, the other after the weak 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: You were right Mike, the tables have turned ;)|pg||
nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||

nt|hedyg: while the Italians stop playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@H showed a real suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
nt|xenya: over the double|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the redbl may have been too expensive for him if they made it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, this contract isn't all that elegant|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brgpro: i already had my money on England...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As long as he has the play to back it up :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if 2 @h showed a heart suit a pass is surely ok - a redbl often used after an x to make prd bid his major|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: I am told that Iceland has extended its lead by 7 IMPs and 1 IMP on boards 8 and 9.|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: If NS are happy with their methods, I see no reason why we should judge them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: At least you qualified, unlike Sweden and Norway, who have been strong in the past.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Regarding England, The Times headline said that is one spill the US won't object to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @S8|pg||
nt|mbruun: Seems like three spade losers if he covers the Sp 8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|atabey: no @c lead makes easily. right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4@c bid may prevent the @c lead|pg||
nt|atabey: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he picks up the @ds..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: Zorlu is a great friend of Zia :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he denied @H and @s controls..|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|othered1: Good leads against slam, so far.  But it still will make with winning @S guess.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 8@s was an entry to dummy to disc all his losers :(|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceblue: I think W didnt know which was better, 2@S or 3@S, then he desided to PASS|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
mc|11|nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||

nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||

nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Are you slandering my intel?! :P|pg||
nt|daman: not so sure that was best|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: with the relays going on N had no information where EW were going. So the X was ok|pg||

nt|brolucius: You can see what I meant when I mentioned 'hard work' a short while ago. It would all be too much for me.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|atabey: they play 15-17 NT. only white against red 14-16. so their 1NT rebid there is 11-13|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  i guess they were thinking more of Meckwell than Scotland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||

pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||

nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||

nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rodvenn: If North has the J9 of trumps, the contract is down|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: E took the played cards and played around with them, face towards him for a minute of so. N was just looking at it in disbelief|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Yes kibs, I know I should pay attention and that's why I do... if you really want to know: a TD came in and had an urgent question|pg||
nt|daman: up by 29 with 7 to play|pg||
nt|andyv:  12 tricks there with J@d falling|pg||
nt|capercliff: T|pg||
nt|rodvenn: This European championship is said to be a test for Madala - Bocchi|pg||
nt|andy_h: The 2 opening comes into play again, 2@S=6cards 8-11|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Constructive weak 2|pg||
nt|rodvenn: As Fantunes is not on the team|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: 13 deals played in under the hour. If only all the players on BBO were so swift.|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Bas|pg||
nt|bagman: This is a typical Meckwell 23 point 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|capercliff: im told 67-67, unbelievable|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hands so far are allowing Piper to control the tempo at the table .. i'm sure the Italians would like to keep him quiet for a couple of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many distinguish between garbage (2@D) and constructive (2M)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 25 I think|pg||
nt|bagman: I have no idea if it makes but let's see if EW bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 6@s is also there|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Oopes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: Declarer should play for the drop in diamonds but people do finesse sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl here could be devastating to declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: no declarer probably makes 10 trikcs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: This should go !A 4x diamonds and a club for easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had five double-figure swings to Italy on the first six boards. Since then only a dribble of IMPs. A margin 51 or more is needed for a maximum win in VPs.   |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: spad to the six?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Good play by Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hiding his @SK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't like to be in South's shoes here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure South does either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||
nt|mbruun: Its almost impossible for him after East has shown 5cH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is very difficult; remember that East bid hearts|pg||
nt|mbruun: I beated you in typing Roland 1-197 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: The moment of truth|pg||
nt|bagman: not yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like W is going to finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the creative defences loses an imp|pg||
nt|bagman: claim time|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: East-West play Gazzilli, so 2@H was a limited rebid. (He would rebid 2@C on a stronger hand).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North might have three diamonds to cash|pg||

nt|hedyg: 13-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Obviously I didn't disturb Versace during play btw)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR seems to be playing in 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: I am a Dry Stone Waller, all day long I Dry Stone Wall. Of all appalling callings, Dry Stone Walling's worst of all (Pam Ayres)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: looks like a preempt hand to me|pg||
nt|bagman: up goes the ace and down goes the contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Our gratitude to the China Contract Bridge Association (CCBA) for ensuring that this event was brought to BBO vugraph. Mr Song Zhao has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||

mb|4H|nt|daman: find all of the running scores here    http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||

mb|d|nt|brolucius: Yes, but not polite to boast about it. Think about the French and English supporters...|pg||
nt|bagman: N is not going to sit, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6NT with a not unlikely @H lead is on, haha|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does North dare to defend? I don't expect so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Badly is ok but England havent played as well as badly|pg||
nt|atabey: invitation+|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean the E hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Spain bid one of these grands against (I think) Ireland yesterday - it made|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And we (Denmark) have been involved in the most entertaining match so far, the one against Cameroon|pg||
nt|atabey: with weak they dont play transfers|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a coffee hand, but better brew it quickly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||
nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||
nt|hedyg: no time for coffee|pg||
nt|atabey: so he did :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Sport, Spanning und Sensation!|pg||
mb|d|nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to make 7 tricks here for -100|pg||
nt|bagman: This is more like no limit poker :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Who's got the biggest balls|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble, says North!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h weak looks ok to me as a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to know?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: When I played bridge with my mother Sunday she just hoped and dumped me in 7NT=|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Finesse onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so should lose two spades and a heart from here, for a boring 110|pg||
nt|andy_h: The cc only says 2@C is stayman, not sure what 3@C is|pg||
nt|brolucius: An exciting auction!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: It shouldnt be all that weak when the opposition dont seem to be coming into the auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: yes   sigh|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR has finished|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is in the nice position that it doesn't matter how many tricks he makes as long as he makes at least 6|pg||
nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for shape  3@D  3343 or 3334  3@H asking  3NT  3334   If Bocchi had four diamonds, Madala might have been interested in slam|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Still plenty of vugraph today. The Swiss Cup Jean Besse from Geneva just started. 48 boards to be played there|pg||
nt|brgpro: in talking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, China women lost to Singapore|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland will Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|nt|capercliff: play to drop QJ stiff before trying for 3@s tricks|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: La Traviata?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that Douglas could not restrain himself on  14 and did double the final 3NT contract|pg||
nt|bagman: In the Bermuda Bowl final against Pakistan Meckewell bid (1M) 3M (p) 3NT (p) p (X) p (p) (XX=showing doubt)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|nt|capercliff: will he go the right way?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|capercliff: when W plays the J@d he can equally have the Q|pg||
nt|capercliff: so it looks to me that either hand can have lenght in @s's|pg||
nt|capercliff: this could be important in terms of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might consider playing the K@d then 4 rounds of @c's, but that doesnt really help him here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andy_h: Fair enough.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: I see that Versace (West at the other table) also responded 3@C.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: The deals have been strangely subdued, in all three sessions that I have watched from this event. (No bonus should be paid to the provider of the auto-dealer).|pg||
nt|bagman: They stood in 3NT XX. Right lead and -9 or something. Wrong lead (made) and 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: He's going to cash out and hope for something nice to happen for -1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bagman: Nothing happens, though and it's going to be -2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, crap|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obviously only +1|pg||
nt|daman: yes   110|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andy_h: I wonder if it's worth to advertise declarer's shape to the opponents when usually the most likely contract will be 3NT after declarer has denied a 4 card major|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show|pg||

nt|sharkey: A plus score looks good on this board|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphznk: I'm more of a Multi-Lousy person|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's true that 5@D could be better if declarer has something like 2-3-4-4 and the spades *might* be wide open, but you can never be able to find out if partner's 2 card spade suit ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: might have an honour or even the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H can be made by East, not West|pg||

mb|1D|nt|othered1: 18-19 HCP, balanced|pg||
nt|bagman: In time means either leading or after @SK|pg||
nt|rodvenn: what to bid as east?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: what happened to Fantunes?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|hedyg: 2@d=18-18 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Ed|pg||
nt|bagman: (or @DA)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it means "you are a charming person, partner"|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Don't you speak Italia?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italian even|pg||
nt|mbruun: Idi means cue, ota is bid, so he was wondering if it was a cuebid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't think kibs do, they're spamming me saying: what you are, or something similar :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South wants to re-re-double|pg||
nt|sharkey: link to running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sharkey: for Open A|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the previous deal it seems that declarer banked everything on a finesse of the @DQ. He might have tried the @D9 first, falling back on a later finesse of the @DQ if that failed.|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Bas|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He played partner's pass to be for penalties|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Typo :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: 430|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Excellent - the Lithuanians bid the spade slam  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a great rule I can recommend for working out whether partner has passed a redouble for penalties|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf nat or balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy slam in a black suit here if East can showing his singleton heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Is this the right board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent bridge, many redoubles|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would want to bid one of my majors here but seems to be a mix up?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c may show extras?|pg||
nt|jbgood: actually a di ruff can always be administered in a heart contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H by East can also be defeated if you are psychic|pg||

nt|bagman: This is likely to go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c overcall by W might not be a favorite by all|pg||
nt|bagman: Requires something like @DA and diamond and then heart finesse to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have this hand to discuss at length later as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is exactly 5-4 with 15 hcps|pg||
nt|bagman: With xxx in diamonds, N expects fit to some suit as S probably has at most xx in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: other room found 4@S, to their regret as cards lie.|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder what 3@s means?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S= short in @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided to stay one level lower - not making pref to @C|pg||
nt|bagman: 3@C would have been an easier make I guess (needing 4 club tricks)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: no stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|daman: transportation is an issue on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 @S may turn out ok as well|pg||
nt|bagman: The spades are nicely but the clubs need to be worked on|pg||
nt|bagman: More chances to go wrong in 2 spades. In 3@C the line of play is sortof forced|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: ah 2NT opened|pg||
nt|brgpro: everyday i learn something new.....what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: and what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c KC?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s 2 without?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now it is completely dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double is Lightner, asking for an unusual lead, normally dummy's suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's always nice when you get to ruff with your singleton trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = "Partner, I have a void, your job to figure out where"|pg||
nt|xenya: might go 2 off -- not that it matters much|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Pekka - 3@C more of a "coffee" hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d9|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Rare misdefense by Sementa|pg||
nt|bagman: he probably did not believe that the declarer would take that line with that hand|pg||
mc|8|nt|othered1: and their auction is what we'd see from many standard system players.  Some weak NTers might get to 3N after 3@S by east, but from the other side.|pg||

nt|katar: nel senso se una donna mi prende per la sua ironia, simpatia e dintelligenza, allora mi eccita altrimenti serve aiuto|pg||
nt|bagman: Well played. Declarer banked on misdefense instead of legitimate chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|andy_h: They say that one of the top conventions that creates the biggest swings comes from the Lightner Double. If you and your partner ever wish to take this (brilliant) convention on, ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: make sure you have clear agreements of when it applies and which suit does it imply|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Of course, no-one would ever question your integrity. You are just a neutral observer|pg||
nt|andy_h: Bas is too busy flirting to take notice of what's going on lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Btw, Madala and Charlsen were to the bathroom|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Italy's lead reflects very solid play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Is 2@D F1R?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe it can be passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With long @Ds only, I take it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fun contract|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|bagman: He was right; there was no legitimate chance to make it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Guaranteed make, pretty much|pg||
nt|mbruun: He will get the diamonds right and make it for sure |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Have to bid it first, though|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 14 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And 2 without @S cue? 5NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have only 7 tricks in diamonds because of the bad diamond break|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 4@H, cue in @H maybe in @s as well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|atabey: and some luck too :) anyways they are far the best in europe|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi tried to Charlsen, who stated he didn't mind. Then Hoffa asked for the screen to be closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no raise to 3@H from North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four trumps to the queen and an ace....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: shell shocked perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it can happen|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|bjacobs: I like 3@H - sort of offering a choice of contracts.  East has already shown his heart stopper, presumably|pg||
nt|capercliff: i thought Piper had passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure Duboin is all that keen on it|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tried to apologise to|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So much to type...|pg||
nt|andy_h: According to the K&R Evaluator, West's hand comes to 12.20.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ9+Q7+KQ743+KJ10|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it was a fine auction, even if a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|paulg:  on 14 i did find it hard to believe that Piper passed twice :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: You get the kids - I'll take the house, etc etc|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphznk: 10/19 leads so far were @C leads, that's funny|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, she gets access to dummy's clubs, but not too clear what to throw on them|pg||
nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think North should have bid 3@h on the last one, though|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bagman: Declearer might go down a lot now unless he cashes out the 7 tops|pg||
nt|sharkey: West opened 1@H canape OR so East was out unless wanted introduce @D suit Vul...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D sets spades as I think 4@C would be needed to confirm that 2@C was based on a natural club suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: XX showing first round control|pg||

nt|sharkey: S wondering why pd underlead @CA..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: It does|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||

nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||

nt|hedyg: he was probably looking for a slam opposite AK@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was explained to Duboin as natural|pg||

nt|capercliff: this the last hand of this set, thank you all for an enjoyable match|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmmm Not really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||
nt|jtr: They might play it in 1NT just for you David|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S had bid 3@h (splinter) then maybe......|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|brolucius: They might get overboard to keep the Italy supporters happy.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us in a most entertaining set of boards... the bridge may not have been perfect but there was a lot of excitement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: jep. siis Partnership bidding melkein luettu, puolustuskirja lukematta, pelinvientikirja hukassa:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Andy, I hope you all enjoyed as much as I did :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Probably an easy hand to end the set. Declarer can make 11 tricks in hearts without a diamond lead and 10 with |pg||
nt|m_niemi: sry, priv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If we knew what that meant, we'd probably agree |pg||
nt|brolucius: If 3@H was NF at the other table, East might well have passed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|bagman: thx all|pg||
nt|andyv:  re:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, sure, partnership bidding is the key to being successful at bridge :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How did I go?|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Scotland have played well in the first two days of the tournament and hopefully that will set them up for the tough days ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Transfer responses after an interference of an opening bid, hence 1@H=5+@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but a very entertaining fight!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas, Vladimir, Andy, Jon, Christian and Martin|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: The TD's here now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: I had to get a hyphen in during the session just to please DB|pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't notice it. Where?|pg||
