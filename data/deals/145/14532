nt|flash: we're in the Chicago suburbs for the last segment of the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|migry: this may be a small swing to welland if they get too high in the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team was originally seeded 20th out of 23 entering teams, a remarkable feat to be 15 boards away from the semis|pg||
nt|flash: the Weinstein team is certainly the surprise of the tournament|pg||
nt|migry: 1NT - 2@d - 2@h -2NT - whatever|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back everyone, :)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|flash: Weinstein-Garner (for Welland) vs Etter Kolesnik in the other room this segment|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil: hi all|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Phil,  welcome |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Hello everyone, will try to get soem commentators asap, untill then, i will try and fill in the gaps|pg||
nt|joest:  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: good morning jack! welcome.|pg||
nt|joest:  these boards begn the second half of a 120 board two-day match in Chicago|pg||
nt|joest:  I just got here so will hold off commenting until the next hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sounds good jack :) thx|pg||
nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Etter in the tank on this one, Good morning Linda|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of those hand where you can make 6 on a good day so 4 is pretty safe even with a poor lie of the cards|pg||
nt|lml: he has to lead a club now and give up the @CQ|pg||
nt|lml: keeping a club|pg||
nt|lml: then if they take dummy in diamonds he ruffs high draws trump and has a club to get there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: missed most of the last segment, but in the 2nd the wheels came off for Weinstein|pg||
nt|phil: hey SHirley|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: so he is going to make 4 in a jiffy|pg||
nt|lml: well a long jiffy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Seems etter was simply being extra thurough, don't want to start out the day going down in a cold one|pg||
nt|lml: absolutely|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: they (Weinstein)  made up some at the end |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Steadied the ship in the previous, picked up an imp on the total, now need to start makin some real headway|pg||
nt|sybarra: not impossible but difficult score |pg||
pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: as NS can make partial in diamonds, 3@c -3 might only lose an imp :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: you want to make sure you have thought of everything|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|flash: we'll keep an eye on the 'run rate...'    Welland needs 17 IMPs in 15 boards|pg||
nt|lml: he can now ruff a heart for +1 |pg||
nt|lml: but that could be down 1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back everyone for the third segment :) will try and put on a good show here |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|lml: good morning|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|inquiry1:  hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|an|2 card raise|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opposite hyper-active passed partner, 1@S probably not an automatic call for everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry1:  Since Eric opens light I don't think NS will get too high. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: what i mean is the NS system opens often :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i didn't bring that up for fear of North bidding too much -- more like maybe South overbid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that 2-card RDBL has popped up a couple of times in the last 2 days -- interesting treatment|pg||
nt|inquiry1:  knowing north only has 2@S will help the defense view the hand.. neat agreement that double is 2 card raise. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Baseggio playing his 2nd Moysian in a row -- not a good way to slow down aging process|pg||

nt|phil: yes I had to leave with about 3 left in the 2nd - it was getting really ugly for them|pg||
nt|phil: working hard on the first few boards is a positive thing - I truly believe the brain needs to 'warm up' |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Matt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: my own failing is the very last board ... I think I have mentally left most of the time by then|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: hiya Harmon, Weinstein had the wheels come off a bit last segment, this will be a key test to see if they can restore some momentum|pg||
nt|harmon: looks like|pg||
nt|harmon: it|pg||
nt|phil: also true|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: we had lots of slam hands in the previous set - this is the first one here|pg||
nt|harmon: lotsa bds left|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose that East has 11|pg||
nt|phil: liberally counted :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: A demonstration of the preemptive power of 1nt.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Jacki: Welcome to our commentator Phil Clayton everyone :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Good morning Phil :)|pg||
nt|lml: but in their system it has not really promised diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: with 70 left, I wouldn't say 60 IMPs is nothing, but it is against a good team playing well, that had the benefits of rest|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|phil: Sher called it a 3@d opener|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: dont think there's any way to make 7|pg||
nt|flash: for security reasons, each match has its own set of hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstien will need some hands to break their way and to "swing" on |pg||
nt|lml: that was an action double... I used to call it a responsible double|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: that doesn't allow for comparisons across matches, but avoids many and severe headaches...|pg||
nt|lml: I am doubling and you are responsible partner|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hi Jacki :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very odd to see that J weinstein Passed with 12 HCP and 5@h on the first board, led to them ending up in 4@s -1, not a dream start|pg||
nt|me argent: norths light opening bid helps get NS to an excellent game|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Moss upgrades a lot, but many would agree with not calling this a "17"|pg||
nt|phil: cant imagine anything but 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|phil: aka "Spike Lee" double (Do The Right Thing)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: roy thought 4n was quantitative|pg||
nt|bobh1: is that what chris intended?|pg||
nt|migry: it is quantitative|pg||
nt|lml: I guess if you open them that light you have to be prepared to play partscore with an opening bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|flash: that would be the 'std' interpretation|pg||
nt|migry: they play 14-16 NT |pg||
nt|lml: opposite it|pg||
nt|me argent: intelligent @H lead by @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: Im pretty sure what everyone plays, but I'll look up their cc's to make sure |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: so 17 (even prime 17) is not enough to DRIVE to slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok forgot about their slightly lighter range|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: I don't think man would pass 4@D with the West hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Joe :) good afternoon|pg||

nt|lml: I apologize now and in advance for typo's man=many in previous sentence|pg||
nt|phil: I thought it had some deep philosophical meaning.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: well judged by etter, and after having several foulups in the previous segment, seems to have regained his form|pg||
nt|me argent: he did and he scores his vul game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all well, defenders have 3 more tricks that's it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: 1@d = always unbalanced |pg||
nt|migry: so EW will open 1@C with balanced hands that contain a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not to mention light|pg||
nt|migry: this is sort of a normal opening|pg||
nt|phil: true; but the defense could have taken the club earlier and achieved that, but the position is murky to South at T3|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c and 4@s fine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finding nothing about CC in ecatbridge|pg||
mb|2C|nt|migry: and you want to get that suit in|pg||
nt|bobh1: for them you mean right?|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't be too happy if the opponents bid 1NT-3NT and take the first 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: this isnt right|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Usually at imps, you will be play safely for your contract - unless very sure it wil be ok to do otherwise|pg||
nt|phil: or maybe it is....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: for some reason people this week are questioning my input more than usual :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes,  4 @S might not be everyones bid|pg||
nt|phil: bonanza available in 4@s x'd here|pg||
nt|lml: the result should match the OR|pg||
nt|me argent: all bids by NS should lead to 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: i would be happy to open that one even when playing "semi solid" openings|pg||
nt|migry: 1@h= S|pg||
nt|migry: not sure Roy saw the double by North|pg||
nt|bobh1: what would 1@s by roy show?|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I think Diamond decided to use the favorable vulnerability to try and make life tough for N-S|pg||
nt|phil: hi Mini  :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: quick 3 @c losers|pg||
mb|4C|nt|migry: his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N bids and he did |pg||
nt|lml: years ago it used to be a debate about whether to open 1NT with a good 5 card major.  Now the debate is over |pg||
nt|bridge_one: a case where it is better to play from weak site|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
nt|phil: 2N feels like an underbid|pg||
nt|phil: 5@d looks normal, but with 2 big cards, and a stiff, isnt a pass tempting? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s would save the day, any other bad enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: no high cards but his partner is bidding his head off|pg||
nt|scotty: N might have tried 3N there - but it's definitely tougher than if Diamond had passed and left N-S to bid their 26 HCP to 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be indeed |pg||
nt|phil: and the group that opened with the 5cM won|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: they have to guess the right lead here|pg||
nt|migry: good pass |pg||
nt|migry: east may try the KS and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|migry: A@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they will get it right but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he leads the @s A Roy will be able to give suit pref|pg||
nt|migry: i bet on the AS lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: how much pressure was pard under?  |pg||
nt|lml: more people have incorporate ways to find a 5 card major into their system and other dont care|pg||
nt|me argent: @H lead could cause problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: south did splinter in @Hs so that lead was a live possability|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|scotty: There is a lot of risk and randomness associated with Diamond's action there - but here he must be credited with generating a swing out of nothing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil: yes, playing various kinds of puppet stayman is sometimes used|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: very costly at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: this was one no one was guessing he would lead|pg||
nt|phil: answer = not very when we are w/r|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: thx at ahollan , he give me the information|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil: a rare misstep for NS - they have been very strong for Weinstein|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: indeed, now cannot avoid taking 1@h 1@s 3@d and 4@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|phil: Im kind of surprised Platnick didnt raise|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: the stranger notrump opening are with singletons|pg||
nt|lml: I am not used to that yet|pg||

nt|phil: good agreement to have|pg||
mb|4H|nt|scotty: E might bid 3@d now and West....?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i believe written as doubleton heart but writting is microscopic|pg||
nt|phil: pass by Sher would also reveal a good hand, right? |pg||
nt|lml: Hampson bid 3@H which got rid of the science|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the quick claim overwrote the lead here - it was a trump...|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h is Smolen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Diamond might get a plus ... wow|pg||
nt|phil: 3@s is probably invitational with 4 as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I would actually play that 2@s is a better hand for spades - but that is not "standard"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and smolen is 5 @s/4 @H  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Maj (p) 2@C 2+@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: As a passed hand, though, 2!x indicated a hand improved enough by the 1@h bid to be interested in game.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil: gotcha|pg||
nt|scotty: I'll be very impressed if Platnick passes here|pg||
nt|cherilou: E might sit for this|pg||
nt|phil: Michael, would you take the xx as a force beyond 2@s? |pg||
nt|scotty: Very difficult to "get" the opponents at the 2-level when they open and you are 3-3 in their suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: (pard bids his 4 card suit to get the 5 card suit played the nt hand if it can be played|pg||
nt|sybarra: one more try with 4 @D or 4 @C?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|scotty: Not a force in any way|pg||
nt|me argent: a usefull convention to have on this hand |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|phil: then I think Platnick's pass of 2@s is dangerous - now he has to play catch up|pg||
nt|phil: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: "on the way" |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|phil: I wonder if 3N was available as some sort of slam try - either serious or non-serious|pg||
nt|lml: I guess Platnick has too much to play the partscore vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no way for brian to pass 3@s with a 17 count, despite only having Q10x in @s for the double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for beginners: 4@H by West is the correct bid - when you know can't play slam, better call immediatly the game without give informations at opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 2@c drury, you know 3rd seat opener partner there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Diamond with a near maximum for a non-1@c opener, decided to eschew any try for a magic hand and minimize the information given to the opps.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: I wouldnt have thought so |pg||
nt|lml: maybe Diamond can make it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil: by Moss|pg||

nt|migry: "steaming"|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe not the best idea|pg||
nt|scotty: I wonder if Diamond was sure 4@d was natural?|pg||
nt|cherilou: what else would it be?|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't know, but he didn't raise.  He hadsn't shown any diamonds, and he (apparently) had shown a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|phil: like the last hand - a little NV action makes life tough for the pair with the cards |pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he thought it was a splinter - or was at least a little worried|pg||
nt|cherilou: perhaps it was just a @H honor|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the N-S NT range?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Fred saying,  thx but no thanks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe not good enough for Serious 3 nt |pg||

nt|jfeld: Hello|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi jason|pg||
nt|jfeld: Does double imply a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|migry: certainly not a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i dont think its lead directing at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||
nt|jfeld: with every suit stopped, actually pretty reasonable, especially as he knows he needs to generate a swing|pg||
nt|phil: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i just looked at pad, i can confirm it showed 2 @H|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks Matt|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can make here, by eloping with club ruffs.  But this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: but what do you bid Phil?|pg||
nt|phil: or they might not play it when one partner opens NT|pg||
nt|phil: dunno; 5@c or 5@s has appeal|pg||
nt|phil: or 4@h as last train if available|pg||
nt|lml: lets say he plays three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|lml: now north south may cash their hearts|pg||
nt|lml: he is going to have to ruff the third heart high and run the @s10|pg||
nt|lml: probably that doesnt work|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: feels like -1, the @cJ should help control the tap|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: everything is right on this hand, but etter doesn't know it, considering various options as he can't afford to lose a trick in hearts|pg||
nt|harmon: probably still his best option|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: with spades 3-3 and diamonds 4-3, he can afford to knock out the A@c and bank on spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hedge his bet, etter is asking about carding methods to try and smith etc. to try and get a read|pg||
nt|me argent: this should make without too much trouble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|harmon: yes but it looks like d's 5-2 with erics false card|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is last train,  but frankly I perfer something like jx for that |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: I meant 4 @H IF last train|pg||
pc|dT|nt|scotty: He doesn't rate to guess spades - N is almost a 2-1 favorite to hold the J|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: Ive never heard a good definition of it, but in this context it must mean, "I have the club control you are worried about, and I like my hand, but I can't move by myself"|pg||

nt|flash: the difference when @Hs is the 2nd suit is that you may reach 4@H instead of stopping in 2@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you say the players are "arguing" about this Matt?|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks like a spade to the Q was an error, resulting in down - instead of a heart to endplay S|pg||
nt|lml: that seems to me to be a pretty normal result|pg||
nt|santyclz: You're too fast for me, Giorgio.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make slam in the previous hand need to find the exact cards and distribution - A great player told always to never search that cards at partner :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: roy felt misinformed in regards to his lead, feeling like if opps had a specific agreement that it showed 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 21NS 19 EW|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|jfeld: and fortunately for Chris and Roy no overtricks, which is less likely after the invitational sequence, and his hand.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well we don't know who informed whom of what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: b4 the lead franco asked johnathan if that shows a 3 card accept with hearts, which was confimred, but, as 3nt would make anyway, they had no recourse|pg||
nt|scotty: Fair slam here for E-W - after the overcall, @sA is very likely onside, so you just need to find @dQ - about 57.5% a priori|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: agrressive bid by geoff at these colors|pg||
nt|phil: the even segments seem to be bad luck for Weinstein|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cherilou: not a good slam here but it happens to make with that old adage 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|harmon: eric expecting more|pg||
nt|phil: think Brad just blasts here with the double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In practice for an expert the odds in 6N are usually even better - you may get information to guide you when you play out the hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d is natual here, not a raise - as if West opened another suit (since 1@d can be short)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure he knows clubs "fit" yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: If E bids KC at some point, West COULD decide to show the trump Q - the fourth @d is big - he knows his partner is 5.  but it is a big risk|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|me argent: a little understrength nt but practical|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: better than the alternatives of 1@s p, or 2@d natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: expecially down so big|pg||
nt|santyclz: These are not the hands Weinstein needs to make a comeback.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: but looks like you are right |pg||
nt|phil: well, double is 'relative' :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5/5's are powerful |pg||
nt|phil: as long as 1@c isnt short, it represents a trick source|pg||
nt|phil: so Greco - Hamspon able to stop in 1N with 12 + 12 - not always an easy thing to do|pg||

nt|me argent: the transfer by south made sure to wrongside 4@Hs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|harmon: good lie this makes too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: ducking will lead to defeat with a diamond back though, but that may not be obvious either|pg||
pc|sT|nt|phil: no weakness in any suit, but no big trick source either|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sher Jackson - Precision Club (Generally 16+). 14-16 NT 1/2 and NV 3rd. 15-17 other 1@d 2+@D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: 6@C -6 at the other table, wow.|pg||
nt|scotty: W was worried he had 3 losers and was willing to stop below game.  E figured that if his partner could do no more than 4@d, slam could not be that good|pg||
nt|phil: Kolesnik should bid 1N with a lot of balanced hands here, regardless of his diamond stop|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|migry: although the defense is routine - establish your long suit, don't pitch winners|pg||
nt|flash: now, it's plug ugly...|pg||
nt|flash: rise and start @Cs to escape for down 2?|pg||
nt|migry: sounds like the best plan|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: 1S has some attractiveness also, but 1N is fine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: yes but the diamond bid suggested to Etter that his AQ was worth AK|pg||

pc|s8|nt|phil: this looks like a smart line|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|phil: well game just needs a little luck in hearts and one of the black suits, and there are endgame positions too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Transfers after 1@D-(2@C) : 2@D=Hearts, 2@H=Spades, 2@S=Diamonds. These may be light and do not promise a rebid. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1M-P-2N= 4+M, Limit raise or Slam Try. (this is italian style|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: W would probably lead a spade so the siding may not matter|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobh1: he heard you Jim|pg||
nt|scotty: With the result in the other room, slam is a REALLY bad proposition|pg||
nt|phil: draw trump and play a spade up - you just need one entry to lead toward the clubs|pg||

nt|me argent: welcome mon ami|pg||

nt|lml: so they figured it out|pg||
nt|phil: no director call Matt? |pg||
nt|lml: its scored as down 1 |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|lml: on BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no, kolesnik realized he only had 8 tricks, so accepted the contest from platnick|pg||
nt|me argent: 2@Ds?|pg||
nt|me argent: would u marshall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 10 boards to go|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16 + HCP Artificial|nt|scotty: E was thinking his partner was 4-4 in minors, and could discard a heart loser on the 5th @d if he played in the 4-4 club fit|pg||
nt|cherilou: opening 4@H would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 48  3nt for n/s in the other room |pg||
nt|phil: 6@c looks like a peeler, but theyll get plenty of action along the way|pg||
nt|me argent: north would and did|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you click team name on left you can reach system information|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 1@c= either natural or balanced|pg||
nt|scotty: W was a little sleepy when he bid 6@c, I think.  Not sure what he was thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team began play last Friday, and it seems Baseggio and Wesintein play a majority of the boards, fatigue certainly an issue with the grueling schedule|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Fred will bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|phil: I suppose but 2@h didn't help his hand one iota|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the X by N (should included spades)  will he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards always do the same thing |pg||
nt|phil: peeler - cold, icy - as is 7@c as was just pointed out to me (correctly)|pg||
nt|me argent: 3@Cs is lead directing and is forcing to 3@Ds|pg||
nt|me argent: a very usefull agreement|pg||
nt|me argent: over TOX|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only @S lead beat 7@s here|pg||
mb|2D|an|12+ HCP 5+ !d|nt|migry: 1@d= heart|pg||
nt|scotty: now there is an interesting question of 5@h or pass then 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: bid my singletons or void |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S going slowing,  can S bid 3 @S?|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h might be clearer |pg||
nt|phil: 4@s indelicate, but reaching this slam is tricky after the 1@d opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but its hard to say how good this is|pg||
mb|2N|nt|scotty: Of course here, S will bid 5@h if N passes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d isn't a surprise for North |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: if N puts in a 4 @C bid,  I think they n/s are off to the races,  as S will cue bid spades |pg||
nt|phil: personally, I think you need to keep a 2@d overcall as natural, and use something else (like 2@h) as Michaels|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt first usefull bid - can be also no balanced - for sure no 5 cards out (i suppose)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting, 5 cards spades outside, propabilities 3-2  68%, 4-1 28% and 5-0 4%|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobh1: presumably 1@s would imply better @cs|pg||
nt|migry: west could have bid 1@s to show 4-4 or 5-4 - 1@h shows a balanced minumum|pg||
nt|me argent: of course this makes playing 6@Cs by EW easy if they can ever get their which i doubt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 6@S or more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: trump lead to beat 7@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio and Matt agreed:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with both opps hoping 7 knowing @D and @S in bad distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: now 4@C ?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: 4 @C by South  (I am going to quick guessing soon)  ..|pg||
nt|phil: well, credit the 2@s call for a lot of this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but wait a minute, with 30 hcp in combined hands seems they ll stop at slam spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: implicit raise in @S (otherwise 4@D)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tough bid for n at this point, needs to agree @ss without limiting hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: the lead gives Roy a chance?   @C lead into the opening bid too tough??|pg||
nt|phil: Sher is looking at a few spade losers and a club suit he doesnt know is running|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo? :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|phil: well done|pg||
nt|lml: it was easy it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry was called away|pg||
nt|me argent: thought u deserted me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the agreement in question is known to many as McCabe (or McCabe adjunct). i use it as often as possible, mainly because it makes me think of Julie Christie (female lead in great ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Altman film, McCabe and Mrs. Miller)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|migry: 1@s just shows an unbalanced hand - nothing about club quality|pg||
nt|sybarra: and credit is due to 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Etter perhaps expected one more spade but the @dQJ make up for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry everyone, missed a step in the bidding|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bridge_one: North know to no have losers in @H@C (5+4+@D@S in south)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: but needed to play @Ss to take a couple pitches??|pg||
nt|flash: North back to same position as opening lead - @C or @HK to get rich; pointed suit no good|pg||
nt|phil: Kolesnik would like to claim, but can't - a@d void isn't likely but you never know|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Vugraphzfj: Interestingly, in the Nickell match, on the previous board, Ralph Katz was in 6@d with north having bid a pre-emptive 2@s and thus misguessed the diamond suit for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: its ok so far so good|pg||
mb|6D|nt|bridge_one: know his singleton in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: who was North?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a 23 imp swing, chip martel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Brian did well not to double 5@h|pg||
mb|6S|nt|phil: this hand might have hit a seam for NS - both have some extras for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if he doesnt know @C suit is running does he really want to be in 3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 6@D is a try for seven @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: south may go to 7 w/ stiff heart on the side?|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, Matt.  For some reason a few players don't realize that their first priority is to ensure the vg operator can clearly see all their bids and plays.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you can't bid 6@D without have the idea to play 7 ....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think South respected captaincy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: and indeed he does, 7@s|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: commentators curse, however let's see the opening lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AK in @D need to make anything|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: now @S lead and down because @d are 5/1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: now 13 tricks on side suit winners and a high crossrough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer needs not to touch trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having 5@D with Q10xxx the lead @S at seven is correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easy w/ AKQJ1098|pg||
nt|h_karluk: adjacent rank trumps at pship cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just employ trumps seperately to bring it home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: must guess whether to try and cash two diamonds, or 3 clubs, however|pg||
nt|santyclz: After the lead will declarer think 3@cs will cash?  He doesn't know that trumps are 4-1.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C by North and pass by East in the auction - no information to make @C lead...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Sher would do the homework well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: assuming the other table is playin in 6@s, this may represent the nail in the coffin, or give the match new life|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: playing A@h @H ruff, @s @h ruff, is down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfj: Lead a trump when it's right they say?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to try 10 in @c after the second ruff in @h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfj: actually after roughing the second diamond and discovering the split, no option but to play it right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfj: Can make 5 now by pitching a spade leading a heart and then up to his k of @s, but, this is risking the contract if @h don't behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: granted, it's risking the contract just as much through any other line, if south has Jxxx in @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Quick update from the other match, Fleisher currently leads nickell 73 56|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: the line playing @HA @h ruff is winning with @C 5/2|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|migry: in the other room NS made 3@h|pg||

nt|bobh1: i think their system hurt them|pg||
nt|scotty: That's like a dream come true for a preempter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: part score battle here, will hampson balance over 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: not being critical, but somehow,  just doesnt make much sense |pg||
nt|sybarra: however its a push!!|pg||
nt|phil: well you can construct South hands with the @cK, and six diamonds, where high levels are in danger I guess|pg||
nt|phil: but when clubs arent running|pg||
nt|phil: at the other table, Hampson was able to overcall 2@d, and Greco jumped to 3@s|pg||
nt|phil: maybe 2@s wasn't forcing...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me it's a coin toss about the weak 2 Joey. 100% yes if the major were hearts though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C 5/2 need in the second line only finding @D 5/1 and @s 4/1 - so the second line is superior|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: N-S would like to reach 3N here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i would say likely yes|pg||
nt|phil: you shrug, put the hands back and have a friendly discussion in the bar later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to popular opinion, 2D is not the least effective of the 3 weak 2 bids. that dishonor goes to 2H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|scotty: They have a big club fit, and each has some worries - S about spades, and N about both red suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, very likely will make 4@s on 18 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if W had just rebid 1n E would pass|pg||
nt|flash: Nickell by 76 with 8 boards left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: conservative pass by etter over 2@s, can't imagine he feels too comfortable, altho not the best hand in the world|pg||
mb|1S|nt|phil: not everyone's style, but I like a 2@s opener as dealer w/r|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT will mostly likely be the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: why?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the previous hand was very interesting, both auction and cards play|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: the other room was 2@d -1|pg||
nt|lml: in 4 bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for one thing, when u open 2D, the opps have more balls in the air --in particular, both majors, and theymay wander into a 43 fit instead of a 44|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when u open 2H, their search agenda is more narrowly focused|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: x= 4 or more spades 1S=3 cards|pg||
nt|scotty: I think Diamond should risk 2@s there.  He has a powerful playing hand, and might have game even facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: needs a trump lead to set it it looks like|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think south can envision a hand with few or no hts with N,  and S has no @S's,  doesnt a trump contract make sense?|pg||
nt|phil: modern treatment - a forcing 2@s call|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: yeah sry was lookig  at this one|pg||
nt|scotty: when you have a void, especially in their suit, you need to be much more aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: system or no, if i were opening that 8 loser E hand I would be saying1H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass ? not 2@h ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: looks like Nickell - Fleisher in one semi-final|pg||
nt|phil: no argument from me on that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: but he's aceless and Hamman's rule beckons|pg||
nt|sybarra: again, not a criticism or resulting (I hope)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5 points 2@h playing in 7 cards can be a usefull bid to leave 2@d at opps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfj: interestingly, in this hand 2@s might have allowed josh to bid 2nt which jackson would surely raise? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffing hearts seems safer than trying to work on the diamond suit, but he has a few options here|pg||
nt|phil: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agree with you last comment Phil |pg||
pc|d3|nt|scotty: Seems asif N should do more here.  Partner's 2@s showed a maximum with shape, and he rates to have a stiff heart (even though he doesn't here)|pg||
nt|phil: 2N might be some kind of asking bid to clarify 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Hamman's rule= if you can play 3 nt do so |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|phil: but @hKTx is certainly a deterrent, and the @sA is a defensive card too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Someone forgot to double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: in the OR Greco led a club honor to maximize the overtricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond jokingly plays the six :x |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told that Meckwel bit the slam on bd 51|pg||
nt|phil: @d lead is the quickest route to a set, but it looks tough on any lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: I see,  every table played 3 nt |pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: making 490|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Hi Shirley, thanks for joining us!|pg||
nt|sybarra: pleasure|pg||
nt|lml: it does look like 10 tricks 2 spades, 3 clubs, 4 diamonds and a heart|pg||
pc|c2|nt|migry: 4@s was ambitious|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand to come in on |pg||
nt|sybarra: :)  and you had to remind us?|pg||
nt|phil: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: Moss hiding the ball a little with the @c8|pg||
nt|lml: which if it holds will give Weinstein their first imp|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|phil: but with the 4-1 trump split those losers arent hiding anywhere|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfj: indeed, the agressive 2@s overcall seems to have paid off, max pressure on the opponents|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|scotty: I'm not sure what the continuations are, but 2N looks wrong with no red suit cards and no tenace - unless there was no other choice.  3@s showing @s value would have been ideal |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|nt|flash: commentators are encouraged to memorize long passages from Bartlett's Familiar Euphemisms...|pg||
nt|bobh1: that wasn't long|pg||

nt|me argent: wasnt clear who was saving|pg||

nt|phil: 2M - that and a minor, 2@c = majors, etc..|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: K@h w/ the opening bidder, not too bad at all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but N/S cam make 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: very likely a swing for diamond, kept NS out of 4@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in the nickell match, EW"s took saves of 5@d and 6@d respectively vs spade contracts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this hand is typical: after overcall both players think about @H :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so NT !|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: but the dangerous suit was @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: if S had the 8 of clubs instead of the 9, 3N would be a likely make as cards lie|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the 2011 Trials will determine USA2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and another bathroom break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the reason is that 2010 World Championship events in Philadephia are NOT country-delimited|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Team Weinstein qualified for Semi-Final after starting as 2nd lowest seed in the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other 3 teams had Bye into the Round of 8|pg||

nt|marlowepi: wrecker?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i guess: 4@s in other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so big swing|pg||
nt|santyclz: They not only found 4@s, it was x'd.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Greco choise to overcall at 2@S in North over 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I guess I dont understand the rush in trying to guess hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: inspired or not it could be a swing for welland|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and with 6 cards i agree with Greco|pg||

nt|santyclz: click the "next" button to step though the play.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|nt|Vugraphzfj: Meckstroth also went down in 4@s playing a diamond up b4 eliminating clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: He took a 75 % play - but @d to K was about 81% - that small added chance of W having @dAQJ came home|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost want to get in early with the S hand |pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein needs to make some action smehow if they are to get back into this match|pg||
nt|me argent: my client got what he paid for i was a public defender|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for experts, the problem in the previous hand is: 1) i can bid 2@S only with a minimum of 2 @h cards after opps told to be strong|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2) i bid 2@s to give a long suit - nothing about @H (that i prefere)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: 3 @H probably some stayman treatment |pg||
nt|phil: fearless 1@s r/w in 3rd|pg||
nt|sybarra: but better judgement prevailed|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: yeah vulnerability is great for a preempt, but suit quality and 2nd seat are not|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 12 IMPs on 112...   46 IMPs with 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|mslair: and will be|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they are running out of room|pg||
nt|phil: bridge in the 21st century - you hold 22 real and the bidding starts 1@h - pass - 1N in front of you|pg||
nt|scotty: Eric Greco just pointed out, quite correctly, I think that I was wrong this whole time....|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Declarer's play also succeeds if West has both high hearts - so only THREE finesses losing is fatal - and that's 87.5%|pg||
nt|phil: he told me that too - so I am ready to take my foot out of my mouth - or at least consider it more :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: so much for needing a stopper :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: typical 1Nt 1 down with seven tricks immediatly (but need @D lead (or a lucky @S)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: lucky @s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: lebensohl (or variant) probably|pg||
nt|phil: 86 down with 51 boards left  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: havoing singleton A in @S the lead @S was high probably, of course (by north)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|scotty: Diamond could have doubled there to say "don't lead my suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is easy |pg||
nt|phil: 4-5 back to Weinstein Im guessing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|scotty: With his spade holding, he is not that interested in a club ruff|pg||
nt|scotty: This is a pretty good but unlucky slam|pg||
nt|lml: these deals have not been helpful if you want to catch up... not many swings to work with|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfj: Willenken "allright roy, u better play the ____ out of this"|pg||
nt|bobh1: chris accepts with all of his extra values|pg||
nt|migry: 3NT is a "state of the match" bid |pg||
nt|bobh1: well he has 3 tens|pg||
nt|migry: you can't win when u r down 50 with 5 boards to go by playing 2S |pg||
nt|flash: with the location of the @S honors, it's also probably a last gasp...|pg||
nt|scotty: N may feel @dA is enough to bid slam here|pg||
nt|lml: and its hard to win imps by not bidding games|pg||
pc|d2|nt|migry: and i'm sure chris knows he's not winning this match|pg||
nt|scotty: And then Diamond will make a lighner double - against SLAM he definitely wants a club lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: caught|pg||
nt|phil: sort of like a poker player with 20-25 big blinds - not desperate, but you need to start mixing things up some|pg||
pc|d7|nt|migry: unless they pick up some (a lot) of imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond actually thought about doubling five spades, unfortunately for sher, he could not see that due to the screens|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 of hts next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry 10 of @D I meant|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|scotty: It's nice to sometimes be able to think without giving away info to an opponent - screens do that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|scotty: Platnick was all set to lead his stiff in partner's suit - now he's thinking|pg||
nt|scotty: He may figure that, even if club void is more likely, if partner's void is in clubs his club holding might help beat slam even if he leads a @d.  Whereas if partner's void is in ...|pg||
nt|scotty: @d, not leading one is very likely fatal|pg||
nt|santyclz: Faith in people not leading their pd's suit.  Unfortunately in this case the lead is sufficient.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|phil: otherwise, time quickly becomes your enemy|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: either he hops @c ace and a trump trick disappears, or he does not and a @s trick disappears|pg||
nt|phil: or he could place a low @d on the table and hope|pg||
nt|ritong: although the second trump trick was not official|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c4|nt|scotty: Disappointment for Diamond - but relief when he sees @sA in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at those club spots!!!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: Diamond awaits the winner; same schedule from here on out...   4 segments per day; 120-board matches|pg||
nt|scotty: This will be 17 more to Diamond team - and an astonishing 64-0 over 5 boards|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: the inspired 5@d bid picked up 12 or so imps|pg||
nt|mslair: minus 690?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 8 against the result in the other room but 4@s wasn't doubled there|pg||
nt|mslair: 450  can't get dbled after the strong 1n.t opening |pg||
nt|phil: other than Linda and Ray Lees blogs :), here is an excellent one: http://thegargoylechronicles.blogspot.com/ written by Philip Martin|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: and N is endplayed already |pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: a few months ago he went through a match and switched places so he had to recover a lot of IMPs against Jack, a computer bridge player|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if E/W have many cards in @S would play there - so probably South with 5+@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|mc|6|nt|bridge_one: possible to DBL at 1@d by east (instead 1Nt)|pg||

nt|bobh1: ew have a thin game here|pg||
nt|bobh1: and they're vulnerable|pg||
nt|phil: well a good surge, but at this rate they will catch Diamond - by Wednesday of next week|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playable slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another interesting hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: which open by west after pass pass ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The last I heard, even "pass" was still a legal call (though unpopular.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so some imps could swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: qx was the key,  but how did he know  (so much easier for us) |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will not help Weinstein |pg||
nt|phil: lots of people dont even know about these resources - but Im happy to help spread the word|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: not sure of NS 2nt range, but if 20-21 worth an upgrade?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 4@S i think need 1@d|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|nt|bobh1: probably ns will compete to 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe see a 4 @H bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: although it goes down |pg||
nt|me argent: but has 2 guess @Ss|pg||
mb|2C|nt|phil: 3@c = lead director / fit? |pg||
nt|phil: never mind ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: would be nice "on the way bid" |pg||
nt|phil: except for the opening bid ;)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but on the way to what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will sound like a "cue fit"|pg||
nt|phil: well you dont know what is lurking on your left |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: always down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something will happen on the way to the guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: exactly - should be a value raise to 3@d|pg||
nt|lml: yes it takes a village|pg||
nt|phil: sure|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know if that means anything but it sounds good|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps here's an example|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: while that may be unlikely|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course the problem playing precision is more hight, because 1@D can be also only 2 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In the other room, East could have made life more difficult for N-S by overcalling 3@s.  His 2@s gave them no problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: over a strong 1@c in the other match, and a 3@s overcall, the bidding proceeded double, p 3nt, p 5nt, p 7nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: so yea, 2@s often does nothing it seems :)|pg||
nt|scotty: So they solved the problem, but I doubt if they were as secure as Fred and Brad, who got to KC and find out his partner had 3KC + @dK |pg||
nt|phil: which isnt too far off, but isnt showing clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pard should hit the deck in 3 @D |pg||
nt|phil: many play 2@d as 'wide ranging' after pard has passed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|phil: good agreements are useful here - I think its fine to play transfers over 3@s|pg||
nt|phil: 3N looks 'obvious'|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: tsk tsk|pg||
nt|bobh1: or then again...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|phil: I think Josh will try for 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: sher took him seriously |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: seems as though the towel has been tossed into the ring...|pg||
nt|migry: yep|pg||
nt|flash: so, before everyone disappears...    thnx to Matt Meckstroth, our operator, for a great job|pg||
nt|phil: but if you are trying to create a little action, wouldnt you like pard to play it, or look into 5 of a minor, etc.?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i suppose at this stage Etter felt like making a "distortion"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|flash: and to our commentators for guiding us through the set|pg||
nt|sybarra: some suggest S bid 4 @d  "on the way"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is playble|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: great job matt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: at least one too high |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I think it makes on a club led|pg||
nt|phil: never mind|pg||
nt|phil: I must be tired, sorry|pg||
nt|phil: I think it does|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it makes on a @c lead, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i think our favorite club players might try and set up two pitches on the clubs even :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: asking for the queen of trump, w/ 5 card support, that usually qualifies :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 3@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: w/ Qjxx in @c and xx in @s decided to quit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2@d by East west must give the raise (probably immediatly over 2@S)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I like the bid better if Partner is limited|pg||
nt|phil: another plug - I really like a forcing 2N over 1m|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East could make 5@d with this auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: indeed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the USBF for organizing the broadcast and inviting us to participate|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: if N was going to bid KC even if S never showed any strength, then 3D would be an idle bid that would rate to help EW more than NS (on lead, for example)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no hesitation from Platnick, nicely done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: and even if not there could easily be some slam some where|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, the 3D bid pointed the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: definetely helps, still not without risk, however.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|nt|phil: imagine Etter with a 3=1=5=4 - what does he do? |pg||
nt|phil: I dont think 1@d is limited, but 3N doesnt end the auction either|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|phil: but it is a space hog|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|migry: congratulations to the Weinsteing team and good luck in the rest of the event - they played really really great|pg||

nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for events and local times|pg||
nt|flash: we hope to see you again tomorrow and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The further the Weinstein team advances, the better i feel, they were the only team we beat in the round robin phase :)|pg||
nt|scotty: It is often profitable to preempt against strong artificial openings - opponents have less room to determine their fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand |pg||
nt|lml: yes I dont like that bid much|pg||
nt|phil: I even play it as a preemptive diamond raise with one pard that doesnt want to bypass 3N :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and one you must get to while giving the opps the least amount of help on lead|pg||
nt|me argent: some people like 2 talk because they like the sond of their own voice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: my p bid 2@d, i have Kxx in @d - opps can have @D 3/1 - not easy to beat 3@C also having QJxx|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the 8 in @S decide 1 down in the previous hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: A card it's hard to show in the bidding...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means 3@D is better that pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 8 imps per board is not impossible if you get swingy hands|pg||
nt|phil: a tough game..cruel too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe n/w should be pards,  and e/s |pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|nt|sybarra: that's right you called it tough |pg||
nt|phil: a lot of 4333's this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: doesnt 4 @S look makeble here for e/w |pg||
nt|lml: there is an argument for open the South hand and I think most players would have done it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing precision with 1Nt 14/16 1 @d is the open in 50% of hand :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: the @D's flop nicely for  e/w |pg||
mb|2H!|an|Good Spade raise|nt|ritong: you also need a fighting spirit which apparently is not junior's currently|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @H's sit well,  |pg||
nt|phil: so, is double here support? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 2H bid is known as an "exclusion lead director"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: interestingly enough, in the nickell match|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3S is down|pg||
nt|santyclz: I certainly agree with that.  For all the reasons you mentioned and for a chance to get a shot at a higher @c contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Nickell +73 with 5 boards left|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@d probably "at least 1 4-card M"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely 3 nt here |pg||
nt|phil: I vote its off over natural 1N overcalls, but on elsewise|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I look maybe it doesnt \|pg||
nt|phil: whatever your runout structure is, it should probably apply here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: alot of illegible writting, so something other then supp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D toy really hurt here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: I vaguely remember a Spingold match at Chicago in 05 (?) where a team was down by about 80 after 32, but lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does 6 @D make"|pg||
nt|sybarra: if I know these players, they not only write small, they write with light pencils, so you can barely see it |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 6@d is interesting and makeable if you get the spades right|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have thought 4@c was gerber|pg||
nt|bobh1: for me it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only with the right view on spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: Matt,  what do you think,,  maybe e/w cant handle it all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, on an 8 card fit, it's possible i suppose :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: looks like 5 realistically|pg||
nt|sybarra: (at leas that was what I remember as operator)|pg||
nt|phil: Linda, what do you think the modern range is for a 4th seat weak 2? I've heard two different answers and both were adamant|pg||
mb|p|nt|mslair: 4h must be last train|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that if east declares @ss, the @d singleton leads is disastrous for NS|pg||
nt|phil: Hampson / Greco got to 4@c but it required Hamspon to wade out to the 4 level over a 3@s raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: both north souths introduced diamonds as well, but against 6@s steve weinstein led a heart, and meckstroth bought it in 5@h doubled, that match should tighten slightly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: back to back hands where a 3D bid swung a zillion IMPs...they should burn their 3D cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as cards sit  3 nt probably better but E knows he is getting a club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: greco was not happy with his pass "Hope ur not too good pard"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h is rubinshol style - that is a very usefull way to bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means (xfert) @s, of course|pg||
pc|c5|nt|migry: not sure how they play it - i think it's just a normal splinter|pg||
nt|phil: I confess I'd probably pass South, but two aces sway me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: and worried about the enties maybe to W hand|pg||
nt|lml: I like to have 6 tricks at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lml: I would pass east's hand|pg||
nt|phil: range? |pg||
nt|lml: if my suit was good say 9 AKQ10xx or something|pg||
pc|cA|nt|scotty: Having escaped a heart lead, declarer must still worry about losing 3 spades, a diamond, and a club|pg||
nt|phil: yes, I think I'd pass too, especially with a pard that loves to open light|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@D would means @H, 2@c @d ...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Greco knew that Hampson had the rounded suits|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|lml: I would like a touch of shape but up to a weak opener|pg||
nt|me argent: this sounds like the KOACHs doing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|phil: so try to avoid diamonds into South - and hope the @hA is there too? |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfj: wow... :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfj: specifically a void splinter explained|pg||
nt|passell: yes surprised Willenken didnt get in with 2 hearts last hand  especially behind |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobh1: that should cause roy to devalue his max|pg||
nt|ritong: or reopen|pg||
nt|passell: 6dia  was the spot here with 2 hearts unable to be cashed|pg||
nt|migry: not quite|pg||
nt|mslair: would have to guess the spade|pg||
nt|migry: u need to finesse the spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: And all you lose is the @c suit (and we've pretty much lost it in other auctions, why not this one as well.)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the @C suit is DBl (or 1Nt) depending on agreements|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere dbl to give @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the advantage to bid in xfert is to give 5+cards suit immediatly - it is usefull in the hign bidding (1@s dbl 2@C(=@D with 6 cards KQJxxx) 4@h by opps - the partner can establish ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to defende or not)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: a strange play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|scotty: Thatseems best|pg||
nt|phil: the other match is tied 46-46|pg||
nt|phil: looks like 7 back to Diamond|pg||
nt|phil: 10-12 / 9-11 feel right but there is a school that calls it a 2.5 M opening - 13-15ish which feels very wrong to me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|passell: yes unlikely with no bidding|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Attempting to set up a pitch for the long @d.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzfj: the point is marshall, irrelevant of the 3@d bid or not, east still has a decision to make on the lead which is not crystal clear :) when you decide to start obsucring side suits, ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: it's going to make it hard for pard to know when to compete/save etc|pg||
pc|s5|nt|phil: ugh|pg||

nt|lml: you are not going to win imps like that|pg||

nt|phil: this is one of the biggest 15 board segments I ever remember|pg||
nt|scotty: I was once down 117 to Brachman after the first day, and we got it back to single digits - but we still lost|pg||
nt|phil: both erred|pg||
nt|lml: I called losing concentration|pg||
nt|lml: you have to stay focused the whole match|pg||
nt|lml: when I play a match like this when I leave the room I am completely wiped.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: This team has played in an underdog role for 7 days now, very exhausting, understandable fatigue is setting in|pg||
nt|lml: if you arent you are not concentrating enough|pg||
nt|phil: very difficult to when down a bunch to a great team|pg||

nt|lml: yes they have done awesome|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but that is what you have to do to win... you have to find it|pg||
nt|lml: you have to bring it as they say|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weinstein suffered a huge disaster on bd 99, playing in 4@sx'd.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt 14/16 is valuated the best range of point in a study in the Pisa University|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: late here for cokes.  think I will take the cocktails|pg||
nt|phil: yes, obviously this team has over-achieved - I doubt you can find many examples of a greater run by a team that came in seeded so low|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: how did you get it back? steady bridge or taking reasonable, but slightly different positions? |pg||
nt|me argent: with all the power in souths hand it should make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: 3 @H a spade raise,  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry everyone, internet gave out, back live |pg||
nt|sybarra: re Matt |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: They were the better team against two powerhouses Meltzer and Welland, earned their victories without a doubt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfj: On any given sunday* :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2A and Qxxxx are a good hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Weinstein made the pass I advocated (rather than the 1nt overcall) and later the bidding got out of hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Maybe Platnick knows something I don't...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: interesting choice by Etter, make a support double on 4 cards, then compete to 2@h, any logical reason for this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Sher and Greco essentially had the same decision over the 1N rebid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably the play xfert 2@h only with weak or strong hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|phil: I have been a victim of this thinking myself, but there's a certain sense of "wow, we have really come far, we have exceeded our goals and then some" and then start to play sloppy ...|pg||
nt|phil: bridge|pg||
nt|phil: but the mistakes you make in a match like this will haunt you for months - or longer|pg||
nt|lml: they will do better next time.  they will know they can do it|pg||
nt|lml: I hope they can playing and build on this|pg||
nt|phil: yes they will be brimming with confidence|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: this layout is not great for declarer |pg||
nt|marlowepi: do we know for sure that is what they play?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: does Brad lead the pedestrian ht |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|phil: Sher bidding the total tricks, but it looks pushy with a defensive 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Looks like no way to avoid losing 2 @d and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer likely to play 6 @D,  hiding his low cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 |pg||
nt|ritong: we all would be happy to be in 4@s i guess|pg||
nt|lml: they did get the worse of the luck this set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H is also an interesting choice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: got the wrong hand on lead  when it rains it pours|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: agreed, yes xx was alerted|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: NV? no thanks|pg||
nt|phil: in fairness they did|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: this example included, although this is exactly the time to bid a slam needing a finesse (and a little more)|pg||
nt|lml: do you understand this auction.  After the forcing club and the positive spade they are doing some relaying |pg||
nt|phil: honestly I don't |pg||
nt|lml: well no doubt have found the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: this slam is actually less than 50%|pg||
nt|phil: I can tell you Sher / Jackson play a more traditional version of Precision, so their auction is self evident|pg||
nt|lml: but on a good day it makes|pg||
nt|phil: definitely a state of the match slam|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|phil: swap NS and it rolls home|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@c would have been touch and go on a trump lead - probably would have made|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: Q@D come from Qx or KQ10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think need to take with A|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: if you use keycard you might not get there off two keycards|pg||
nt|lml: in hearts of course|pg||
nt|lml: playing in diamonds in worse than hearts really because you still need the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lml: you dont have enough tricks without the heart suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: after much deliberation, a shoulder shrug and a pass :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: He was just waiting for your permission.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: 1N isnt playing like a dream mind you|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the Club Brad's first choice? |pg||
nt|lml: so the bridge luck gods stay with Diamond|pg||
nt|phil: agree  - with the entry situation, you cant pick up 4-1 hearts anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: who will be quite happy when the heart finesse fails|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|phil: so I would think the swing machine will be up and running in the next segment|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|nt|bobh1: their system of transfer responses has backfired on them a couple of times|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: director here now, checking on time:  8 minutes left on the clock|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the play will be much faster than the auction|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: especially after director mentions time crunch :)|pg||

mb|3S!|an|Shortness|nt|scotty: Some might have acted over 2@d with S - either double or 2@h is possible (i think 2@h is preferable between those choices)|pg||
nt|phil: but its quite likely Weinstein will open the E hand 1N and also get to 3N from the other side|pg||
nt|scotty: there is a pretty good case for leading a high heart here.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: some where n/s are going to find the spade shift |pg||
nt|phil: Josh will |pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Or a high spade!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S in this sequence means a shortness|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: same lead both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: (more usefull that to use 3@S to give value in @S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: High heart can gain against opponents Jx And if partner has JX, you have the entries to recover|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: declarer is not taxed with the heart break and diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lml: there are 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: more interesting on a passive lead|pg||
nt|lml: not taxing at all|pg||
nt|santyclz: For new players:  On this type of auction one frequently sees the balanced hand bidding 3nt with the ace of the suit.  3nt should typically deny the ace except with very minimal ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: hands.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|phil: 4@s anyone? |pg||
nt|phil: after 5 hearts and two diamonds, declarer would need to exit hand with something|pg||
nt|phil: all roads seem to lead to 9|pg||
nt|phil: except a low club and club back maybe|pg||
nt|phil: Platnick leads the J - why? A: he doesnt want a cover|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good point Joe|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|phil: but I think Etter should  which he does|pg||
nt|phil: and is sagely ducked|pg||
nt|phil: so a few more to Diamond for the uptricks|pg||
nt|lml: he ducked so many times its strange he would cover here|pg||
nt|lml: there is no position I can think of that would make it right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: mad scramble for 1 nt here |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|phil: I would assume A asks attitude and its logical to encourage with Jxxx (they play udca)|pg||
nt|scotty: Since East denied 4-card hearts, I see no advantage in the trick 2 low heart shift, as opposed to high heart|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bobh1: was wondering...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a trick (may 2) short of 1 nt so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but only 50's |pg||
nt|phil: Fred trying to steal his diamond trick before the spade tsunami|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of H! should suggest the spade |pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil: I think it comes down to how many tricks you don't mind conceding|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Special thanks to our wonderful commentator Michael Rosenberg ! |pg||
nt|sybarra: tied in the set again |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Two more boards left of the 4th segment here from chicago, 60 boards remain in this semi-final match tommorow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you start at what time tomorrow Matt?|pg||
nt|phil: so yeah, covering is probably a bad idea|pg||
nt|lml: if declarer has Jx and you cover he might go wrong I suppose|pg||
nt|phil: so the lead eclipses 100|pg||
nt|phil: he shouldn't - we aren't splitting with KQx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Two more boards left this segment, there will be a 10-15 minute break following board 105 prior to the last segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: special thanks to our wonderful commentators for helping out! :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: @D lead beat 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: but that is your only hope if he actually has that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another 3 imps on bd 42 for N/S |pg||
nt|lml: but yes covering is wrong|pg||
nt|phil: was told all other defenders except Hamspon ducked|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Diamond sat for a while then shrugged his shoulders and bid 3nt |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Would like to give a special thanks to our wonderful commentators Shirley Ybarra, Phil Clayton and Henri Schweitzer @h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems to be fairly likely this time.|pg||

nt|ritong: merci matt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: play resumes at 10:00 am Central Time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS might push to 4H, spade lead best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt normally get there but score needs padding|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: suddenly a tight match was just blown wide open in this set|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play it here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 am in chicago,  that is 11am in NYC,  and 5 pm in Europe,  (4 pm in LOndon) |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: What's your theory on 2 suited hands in the pre-emptive HCP range, at what point do u upgrade to 1@h instead of 2@h here shirley?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has no more than an invite and N does not have a real acceptance. but both may go bullish|pg||
nt|bridge_one: first count, after preference|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: after two days of sparring with each other|pg||

nt|sybarra: never can get it right|pg||
nt|sybarra: but will be 10pm in China |pg||
pc|d5|nt|scotty: Can make 6 here with perfect card reading - N is squeezed without the count if S ducks at trick one (simple squeeze if S wins trick 1)|pg||
nt|lml: I have to leave for a while.  THanks for all the fun Phil.  A really great job Matt.|pg||
nt|lml: bye now|pg||
nt|phil: Kolesnik planning a limit raise but rightly upgrades once partner shows diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Thanks everyone for tuning in, two more boards remaining in this segment, the next segment (6) will begin in about 10-15 minutes following the conclusion of board 75|pg||

nt|bridge_one: note the J in @D for @h by west|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+ HCP artificial|nt|scotty: Most North's, had they started with 5-card @s, would have pitched one at some point - so the position is actually guessable - pitch spade, @dAK, spade to dummy, @d to N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: great job by operator:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S worthwhile|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not impossible to overcome this deficit but not easy either|pg||
nt|phil: so if you are just tuning in, things have not been going Weinsteins way, although they have been playing reasonably|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7HCP|nt|Vugraphzfj: North just pointed out the margin was never more than about 20 the entire match, untill the end, a well faught battle|pg||
nt|phil: they have just been on teh wrong side of a few close decisions|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: reminds me of some great boxing matches I've seen|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S not n/s best spot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: kolesnik getting a little frisky :), i assume it's just general force showing spade stoppers or something?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Matt Meckstroth our terrific operator in Chicago,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes folks he is related to that other Meck |pg||

nt|ritong: imaginative opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: D lead will help|pg||
pc|c9|nt|scotty: S should raise here - N showed a hand better than a 2@s bid, and S has 3 "working" cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i dont' know how they play this sequence - many use this also with 4@S 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: y, both 1@s and 2@c alerted as can have longer minor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: lots of vugraph tomorrow,  as the European championships continue +more US |pg||
