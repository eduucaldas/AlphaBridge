nt|figb_rama: -11 dall'Olanda, che guida la classifica|pg||
nt|cumino: Chi gioca qui?|pg||
nt|cuan: buonasera a tutti|pg||
nt|figb_rama: non giocano Bocchi-Madala|pg||
nt|figb_rama: però non so chi giochi in aperta|pg||
nt|figb_rama: ho visto Agus cui su bbo poco fa|pg||
nt|figb_rama: e gli ho chiesto il motivo della giocata a slam|pg||
nt|cuan: qui DS. anche in aperta si alternano le tre coppie|pg||
nt|figb_rama: mi ha risposto che chi doveva attaccare ha pensato un pò all'attacco e lui ha pensato che fosse corto a fiori|pg||
nt|figb_rama: e che gli servivano 3 carte di cuori|pg||
nt|figb_rama: comunque, ha concluso, una mano di....fortuna...|pg||
nt|caruga: grande coppia francese in N/S, ci divertiremo sicuramente|pg||
nt|nipotino: con Chemla, di sicuro|pg||
nt|gluckenval: benritrovati... anche questo incontro è di gran fascino|pg||
nt|cuan: contrariamente a quanto fatto finora, in aperta per la seconda volta oggi lorenzo e alfredo|pg||
nt|tax456: cè Mari di la altro che Chemla...dura..|pg||
nt|julia11: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Intanto prima di partire approfitto per dare un po di dati... 3 dei giocatori francesi hanno vinto 3 titoli mondiali, le olimpiadi 1980 e 1996, e la Bermuda Bowl nel 1997, ovvero ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Chemal, Levy e Mari|pg||
nt|nipotino: ciao giuliana|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Chemla|pg||
nt|toniemme: Ciao a tutti))))|pg||
nt|julia11: ciao Fran|pg||
nt|caruga: ciao Toni|pg||
nt|julia11: ciao toni|pg||
nt|nipotino: tonino!|pg||
nt|cumino: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|cuan: ben arrivati|pg||
nt|gluckenval: questa che vediamo qui è la coppia con maggiore esperienza e la loro partnership si perde nella notte dei tempi. Hanno vinto nel 1999 l'europeo a coppie.|pg||
nt|tax456: ci mancava Mortarotti...|pg||
nt|caruga: 899.....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: dopo che si sono separati (sono, diciamo, 2 caratterini belli pepati, qyello Paul Chemla in particolare), Levy era diventato il compagno di Mouiel, recentemente scomparso.|pg||
nt|cuan: siamo in vugraph gianluca ?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|figb_rama: non lo so...|pg||
nt|tax456: questa è sicuramente la migliore formazione che i francesi possano metter in pista.non sono boys,ma..|pg||
nt|figb_rama: Eria siamo in vugraph?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gluckenval: Levy talvolta gioca su BBO col nickname EVIL... mentre probabilmente Chemla non sa neanche che col computer si potrebbe anche giocare a bridge :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cumino: Però in compenso conosce benissimo l'Opera.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|caruga: finalmente un avversario per il quale basta una riga ad illustrare il sistema, vero Gluck|pg||
nt|tax456: vero tutte le romanze a memoria e le canta pure|pg||
nt|gluckenval: E' vero, Chemla potrebbe cantare il 100% delle opere esistenti|pg||
nt|tax456: ahi...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|tax456: meno male|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|cumino: 2 daown con attacco briscola e briscola e briscola credo|pg||
nt|cumino: così 1 down|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Levy è l'esatto contrario contrario di Chemla, è di solito tranquillo, gioca a tennis e golf, e mi dicono anche a bowling. ha una collezione di film che fa invidia alle 20th ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: century fox....|pg||
nt|tax456: 2 down eguale|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT di alfredo è fit limite 4°. 3@C sarebbe stato una via di mezzo tra il barrage e l'invito, 3@D il più forte degli appoggi |pg||
nt|gluckenval: Ed ora il sistema... si mantiene la tradizione francese dei sistemi a base naturale, 5a nobile e miglior minore. 1NT 15-18, 2@C forte e 2@D semiforte, 2M sottoaperture standard|pg||

nt|bagman: Sementa likely to pass this as S could not open|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everyone passes the s hand even with the poor @S structure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: did not feel for it|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're due for some interesting matches|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
pc|h2|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: kalimera se olous|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||
nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||

nt|mcarroll: They certainly play fast!!|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|ady: a heart pip shourt of a good slam here   can make by dropping A@H doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C on the heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eweber: unluckily we still don't have running scores from group B in the Open|pg||
nt|motu: DBL is 6-8|pg||

nt|lmeili: easy 3N for EW|pg||
nt|boyklas: nvul, would you have bid 3@s now?|pg||
nt|motu: not my style|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam 6@C is the best spot    6@H down quickly on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but slam is a little far fetched if you ask me|pg||
nt|davidb: N practically looks at 8HCP|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT on the same|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
mb|r|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
mb|3H|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: 5@C is a good bet|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||

nt|andersk: Hi Martin, Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||

nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|haans: no a copunt|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: ok well done|pg||

nt|bagman: Now the endplay in spades for 10 tricks|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcarroll: Obviously listening to you Anders :)|pg||
nt|andersk: abot time:)|pg||
nt|andersk: about|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then declarer wld be a @h less and a @c more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c K favorably placed always makes, west doesn't need to care signals|pg||

nt|athene: 7@H here - let's see if they find it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
mb|5H|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
pc|sA|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
mc|13|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||

nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||

mb|1H|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||

nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||

nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
pc|h4|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
pc|s3|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||

nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||

nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||

nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||

nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: my guess is 3nt was "serious" and also "seriously misunderstood"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: just 2 aces  in a spades contract|pg||

nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||

pc|hT|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||

nt|vasmar: probably south was afraid to double thinking that it woule be their only trick :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcarroll: a better 2nd half for Austria but still amassive difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam on here|pg||
nt|ady: regulation 4@S here for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: part score board|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 6@C    doubt they will reach it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: Very friendly placement of cards for 4@S.|pg||
nt|andersk: indeed|pg||
nt|eweber: 1NT -2 for 200 won 3 Imps|pg||
nt|lmeili: good result for Bulgaria in open room, |pg||
nt|tomi2:  inspired 3@S bid, any idea what he intents to show here?|pg||
nt|haans: dbl make it possible to just pass|pg||
nt|vasmar: hearts for N-S diamonds for E-W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust 1nt is forcing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: South thinkin: whats going on?|pg||
nt|Walddk12: It does|pg||
nt|haans: one extra bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it should be - this is the european championships|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H normal contract here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East is playing...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk12: Links to Open B  Open A  and  Women|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I would raise him to 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: suddenly everyone's hand seems to have improved|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky to have two trump losers|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|rigas_karo: with a @h lead, the paly will be very fast...|pg||
nt|motu: i guess he can find the @D position|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|athene: before declarer gets the clubs going and throws two diamonds on spade and the last club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2:  official scoresheet says 3nt-1 and the play looks like|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@S here depend on heart play after a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||

nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
mb|5D|nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 5@D made so 9 to Neth.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: when in hand @CQ and !K@C to force W to play Ace @C|pg||
nt|vasmar: unmakeable|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
