nt|lestergold: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fredin may bid 3@s more for the lead than anything else|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||

nt|mamos: south thinks Oh gawd here we go again|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@s shows 4-9 and Sabine is not known for underbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the placement of cards 4@H has a good play for NS.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: looks aty least down 1     had a place with spade finesse right|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe I should add that it shows @s+m|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S shows 5+ 5+ minor 4-9 so about as expected i guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vbman: yes 2 or 3d|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the 1NT range?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says (14)15-17|pg||
nt|haans: do not expect a dim loser|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Makeable contract, the defense taking 1@C+1@H+1@S=3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello haans.|pg||
nt|haans: bad lead :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E had no choice, imo:)|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for wijs-muller seams to be new entry|pg||
nt|paulg:  now Fredin wishing he'd bid 3@s!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: plsuppose he does not want south in|pg||
nt|haans: well lots of @H not correct for bids|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: to p,lay trump thru|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|ady: unfortunate top heavy in diamonds opposite singleton |pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Ben|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT = bid what you think you can make|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: could well scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and will do well if he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: even one off no disaster|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cannot shorten trumps from both hands to avoid 4-1 break, small @C to table to play @H.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: EW natural with a strong NT. NS Precision with a 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy:  I wouldn't have bid 5@D with the south hand, partner was only competing, he could have doubled 3@D or bid 3@H with a good hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s not for the fainthearted|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensuring the contract safety play.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: the EW 1@c can be gooey|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running scores|pg||
nt|haans: TG CC say Flannery :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
pc|d9|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
pc|hK|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|jtr: Now the @cA will be led|pg||

nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT is Relay I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  slam is likely to make if they get there|pg||
nt|eweber: NS plays a variable NT, NT opening nv 1st and 2nd seat 10-12|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be reluctant to pass this |pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d looks to be a safer partial than 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i still think the score in board 1 is wrong|pg||
nt|shevek: we don't have a score in bd 1|pg||
nt|shevek: you mean bd 2 Vlad?|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 i meant|pg||
nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||
nt|ady: west has to legislate for a possible bust with east|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south did not feel obliged to cue bid|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South knows that for Slam to be good she need a lot of cards from North|pg||
nt|eweber: the NS pair in the other room also plays "variable" as I just see, 14-16 in 1/2 nv and else 15-17 |pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: we know he has 8, but he does not|pg||
nt|haans: england can take it|pg||
nt|jallerton: they got there in the other room when W doubled 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak two in a major, 2@H/@S=two-suited|pg||
nt|haans: imagnative leads not succeeding are not popular|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry Bethe, welcome.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: will be there 3th match today|pg||
nt|haans: yep 9.30 13.00 16.15|pg||
nt|haans: central time|pg||
nt|haans: hi Jean|pg||
nt|mamos: and the Club weakness has been identified|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well swap south's minors and slam is ok|pg||
nt|mamos: just the trump Q to cause anxiety if EW cah clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
nt|mamos: cash|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done by east|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
nt|eweber: no big surprise that they lead a club if 4@s and 5@d were cuebids|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly dubinin dictated fine|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: EW cannot take many clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, there is a typo in North's name.  EKREN|pg||
nt|andersk: Im not sure what vent wrong here. I like playing 3 @C over 1x-1y-2NT as search for info. Ekrens 4 NT I disagree with, 4333 and actually nothing good exsept for AK A|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk5: Reverse the  R and K|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: X=0-4, Pass=5-7 after 1C-(1x)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that makes sense, ty|pg||
nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|jallerton: As Ben points out, if  you X what if it goes 3C 3H to you?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|xenya: however that was far from clear|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this sort of hand, it is usually a good idea for north to be able to show shortage below game level|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andersk: 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensured 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|pitiful:  the degree of fit opposite shortage is often the key|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|jtr: Down 5 cant be right though|pg||
nt|dburn: but going down five seems an extreme way of registering discontent|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: diamond switch required from Brock|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: It seems declarer drew an extra round of trumps for no identifiable reason|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: no, she didn't - she needed to cross to dummy to continue getting the hearts wrong|pg||

nt|vbman: ---------------4-------------------|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again a tricky hand NS with combined 25 hcp may end up in 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: in my cristal l see several down in 3 nt|pg||
nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 6@c depends on guessing who has the doubleton @h A (or singleton)|pg||
nt|benjy:  you are completely scuppered|pg||
nt|mamos: Anyway passed of safely|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d showed a 4card mixed raise according to their CC|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me east does not have a 3@d bid but it is much closer than the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll is going somewhere about three off so someone seems to have done tooo much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W may well be afraid of game bid next door|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: frankly this is rooutine defence for top class players but in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: no end play etc -1|pg||

pc|s4|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: a much needed 12 imps to england on the way here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: good discarding from Townsend|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: pls don't say such things until they are racked up Mike - no tempting fate ty|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and good discarding from both of them|pg||
nt|copeyj: helping each other to make the hand double dummy for both|pg||
nt|lestergold: both card perfect but as i said you would not expect l;ess from players at this level|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||

nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||

mb|3D|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||

nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||

nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||

pc|c5|nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: althouh i don't see why it was necessary to play spades at that point|pg||
nt|copeyj: well it wasn't nice to see an error|pg||

nt|dburn: declarer took only ten tricks at the other table, but there seem to be eleven available|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose East needs to be careful not to get the queen of spades ruffed|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, she drew trumps and gave up 2 @cs sensibly enough|pg||
nt|ady: its awkard    needs to ruff 2 diamonds   and with north having 3 trumps and doubleton spade  there is a problem|pg||
nt|ady: trumps or spade from North seems best|pg||
nt|dburn: well, ace and another club would probably work well - East would put up the king and hope for hearts 2-2 or spades 4-3|pg||

nt|jtr: I was given numerous solutions but not that one i dont think|pg||

nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||

nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ive been looking at scores instead of bridge :(    sorry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Townsend, who used to be known as 'Young Tom' at my local club, has become more conservative with age|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: It would be a good match, probably the match.|pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@H|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|shevek: no finesse in OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodvenn: tounrament director, and make them go thru the boards one by one. |pg||
nt|andersk: jeez....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in the end they accepted that it was a draw|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand:)|pg||
nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|copeyj: 2N is roughly 21-22 for Gold/Townsend (1@C opener can include balanced 20)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c big there, m i alone ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just borrowed one HCP|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gromov spicing things up a bit with a delayed 3N overcall here :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: good job by GeO|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||

nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||
nt|haans: then you are in 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: acceptance from W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guys - today is a "short" day - 1 or 2 matches only|pg||
nt|eweber: I think 1NT is just and relay without 4M|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|jfaria: no 4 @s easier to comment :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: makeable 4@H heare, fortunate @S A and unfortunate @H split, thats 1-1 and should be +420|pg||

nt|paulg:  i wonder if Gold is playing 2@h as a good weak two and 2@d multi as a weak weak two in third seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: 2@c is stayman with the intention of follow up with 2! which is invitational|pg||
nt|christinas: @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: well flat thankfully for england dont think they can afford any more adverse swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s is not a great contract tho especially non vul-|pg||
nt|lestergold: neeeds 2 out of three fimnesses and a 2/1 spade break more or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: the problem is if dummy is forced |pg||
nt|rodvenn: before the spades is established|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after so many " @s " bids, will W lead this suit?|pg||
nt|mamos: it's amazing how little help so many CCs are|pg||

pc|s5|nt|haans: @H entry to be removed|pg||

nt|pitiful:  4@h is a good spot here|pg||
nt|eweber: such things happen, but I am amazed that no one realized when it happened in the vugraph!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|copeyj: although looks like 11 tricks so maybe england got away lightly|pg||

nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||

mb|2N|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Both East's treat the East hand a weak two rather than a three-bid. The suit is not good enough for a vulnerable 3@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apostrophe was to annoy DG, naturally.|pg||
nt|dburn: this could be awkward - South has promoted her hand to strong no trump status on the strength of the "well placed" @hQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Not weak-two?:)|pg||
nt|dburn: and now she is in a lot of trouble, unless North can redouble for rescue|pg||

nt|brolucius: Alternatively, if you are goint to bid 3@S (and I agree that 3@C is better), you bid it quickly with the air of someone who has a good suit. |pg||

pc|hK|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: which hand are you talking about david - 9?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ten when @SQ drops|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: Andy : problems with the claim almost every time - we have given up :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|copeyj: if so then yes he wld have started with 2@C transfer to @D|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||
nt|haans: 5 losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  Meckstroth's Rule: bid game when partner raises your six-card major|pg||

pc|s8|nt|ady: ok     thx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: preempts are double edge swords and twins are supposed to get experienced abt that issue, but who knows there were a tough table pressure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@C looked a bit dodgy for South at the other table. It seems to imply that they use five-card Stayman and South would have stuck a 5-1 spade fit.|pg||
nt|dburn: they don't|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was she going to do over 2@S then?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c is various things, one of which could be a signoff in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: she wasn't - her partner isn't allowed to bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: What do they use for Stayman then?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: they bid 2@S after 2@D|pg||
nt|dburn: they have a complex system of responses to 1NT that would be banned in Chandlers Ford, but works quite well in places where they play bridge|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: delay after W bid NE at other side of screen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another routine 4@S.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: none, as it happens|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another potential strong @C for dubinin|pg||
nt|jfaria: again strong bal 1@c|pg||
nt|haans: 7@S?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 7@s Very optimistic|pg||
nt|haans: agree but (swede)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I hate singleton K and Q - but still I would open 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: with the !K in her hand known after playing the Q earlier, @c K was the best she could try|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|copeyj: 1@D negative from Gromov i expect|pg||
nt|copeyj: on board 10 (just played)|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: England are playing 3@H undoubled in the open room|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 down|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|copeyj: and 9 imps to England (much needed)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1@d = nat ALWAYS unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: 6@d anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: i like it|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: disciplined partnerships mahy handle it|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 AND NO PLAY FOR 3n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Non Ace@C lead makes 4@S.|pg||
nt|copeyj: combined 24 i think mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 17 opp 7 isnt it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 24 i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure why 1@S alerted.  Card suggests 1@S is nat, <GF|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gold is not passing this, just considering best way forward|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has bid 4@s opposite that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shevek: I wonder why south didn't cue @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: hearts|pg||
nt|haans: 5-6?|pg||
nt|haans: what did 21Hx show?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||
nt|eweber: y, there you are right, but who would seeing a doubleton in dummy and the chance to overruff in @s?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d should set the trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: now here is a hand i specialise in|pg||
nt|copeyj: playing in 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c in the German system askes for 4@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess Dubinin draw the big picture and respected captaincy|pg||
nt|paulg:  second double would normally be a strongish takeout|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d shows a doubleton @h?|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@d say no|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: they seem to get there anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: slam rates to go down though -- on the surface|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @c lead declarer has to guess @ss|pg||
nt|haans: 5@c AND WAIT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norge slapp unna en katastrofe i det andre rommet.Boye doblet 4 hj og islendingene rettet til 4sp|pg||
nt|rodvenn: fortsatt spill 8|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S could be 3 @S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  the redouble said 'bid your suit'|pg||
nt|jallerton: Oh sorry I am asleep|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a method close to my heart|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
nt|eweber: if I remember correctly and they still play like this|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: has to run this, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: IMPs right i assume|pg||
nt|paulg:  as happened to Scotland's women in the previous match, bidding a thin grand slam when the opposition are only in game is not a winning formula|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d9|nt|haans: ot is double unlucky|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|andersk: as I predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: @c had to be 2-2, so @S J quite safe|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||

mb|p|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||

pc|cT|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: and this sequence implies five spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems they used some form of checkback next door but checked out|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: ah strong @c though|pg||
nt|dburn: they used a strong club system next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: as they have been doing for many years now|pg||
nt|brolucius: North cannot really 'take a view' and pass 3NT.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|jtr: So South just asked for a 4-card major?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 is it|pg||
nt|copeyj: I even laid the addition out for u Mike :)|pg||
nt|eweber: following links from the official result page you can reach that one to see what is going on on board 12 at the other tables|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  strong @c|pg||
nt|eweber: right, but Sabine and Dany can be slow when interesting hands come up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: both vul and weak NT in action|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15 the deficit and 8 boards to go so eng still has chacne to reverse this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand looks like a 1N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: deficit|pg||
nt|jfaria: those hands are tricky, 8 hc points and a void... facing 1nt|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|copeyj: will this end in 2@SX e/w? that would not be pleasant for them|pg||
nt|jallerton: the Sweded missed a decent game in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator - I know it is diff - but dont claim 10 tricks when opp has taken 4 tricks, pl :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But you had given up:)|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 10 was not passed in as we thought|pg||
nt|haans: SW other side of screen|pg||
nt|mamos: all these players have lots of medals and championships to their names|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh hearts is hard work tho shouldmake|pg||
nt|haans: even today|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: nicely bid and with @S 3/3 makes.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sJ|nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 if Fallenius gets @Cs right -- more if he doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: he does 50% of time :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jfaria: small plus for NL|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: he does not 50% of time 2|pg||
nt|haans: is it time ti think now?|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, he might play clubs from the top, then try for some endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: very obscure, all that|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 11 Cullin bid 6@d|pg||
nt|xenya: lead?|pg||
nt|shevek: @d|pg||
nt|haans: thats why we are leading am never we if they are losing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible, really Jansma played @d7?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|nt|xenya: so a nice pick-up for Sweden|pg||
nt|pauleger: he may now try the @c finesse and go down|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jfaria: EW going down increases the gain|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: he does not know @H are 4/4.|pg||
nt|pauleger: taking the chances for the @cK onside or the doubleton @sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: pick up = deal 11|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: that's the one we were talking about :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: 1NT was a relay, and the rest of the auction was artificial|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: 2NT to 3NT, I meant, of course.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Thanks for that  It must need artificial methods to avoid 5-3 fits:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: this may end the auction - neither North nor South has anything in the way of extras|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Quite right to stop.|pg||
nt|ady: assuming getting hearts right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|dburn: but at the other table West led clubs and continued the suit on winning the ace of hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: again, the way the play was shown here, the result should be 2 off, not 3 |pg||
nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
mb|d!|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
mb|p!|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|eweber: good defense against a making 3@d contract :)|pg||
nt|mamos: must take diamonds now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
nt|mamos: :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 1 convention I realy dont like. thats the 1NT Forcing - dont hear me, if u like that convention :):)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|andyv:  Dubinin really taking this long?  unusual for him.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: settling for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well done|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: better this match then first no score at all then|pg||
nt|shevek: hahaha they made 6@h on both sides!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: u dont have to look for running scores - all tre group are off-line - hard to start a big tournament as this - over 60 teams - and more from saturday (Senior !!!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes |pg||
nt|haans: have you never done that?|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|pauleger: good anticipation|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I was only afraid of this play.|pg||
nt|ady: england without a plus score since hand 5   the 6NT hand|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: 2@S is usually played as NF (at the other table).|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c was weak with diamonds or a game force|pg||
nt|jtr: Play here will be helped by knowing more about the distribution|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Well done. |pg||
nt|dburn: Sally seems to think so, though, and now I think she's right|pg||
nt|jtr: But cant North be thrown in as a spec points out?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah you cant win this in dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Because South can overruff the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can win it in dummy, ruff the club and exit with a heart, but North can just play another heart|pg||
nt|jtr: And pitch a @d if you ruff high|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: Interesting hand  Made easier next door by the @s bid as DB9 pointed-out|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: yes, once the team mates sit the same way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly but lead was good. Kept E thinking.|pg||
nt|jfaria: not ver exciting hands... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: either all pass or Fucik opens|pg||
nt|haans: 14 4@S a make|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jallerton: 3 imps if 4@s made exactly|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: transfer to @S (4+) could have a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South likely to bid 2@S - unless 3@D would be a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the hand is a bit weak for that action|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just trying to help Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: 5 Imps for GER in board 10, Sally bid 2NT vs this wk2 on @h 10xxxxxx, ending up in 3@sX for 800|pg||
nt|mamos: id guess that germany are winning the match at the moment|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: South undeterred.... |pg||
nt|andyv:  good call, Mike|pg||
nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||
nt|paulg:  but that is probably why I'm commentating|pg||
mb|4D|nt|shevek: half way!|pg||
nt|shevek: anyway, past midnight here, work tomorrow :(|pg||
nt|shevek: have fun everyone|pg||
nt|haans: jump to game with minimim hand|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks and I'll find out the REAL score tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: showing 5 spades i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   leb?|pg||
nt|lestergold: leb?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Bye Nicoleat seen you again|pg||
nt|shevek: bye now|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Hans and Vladimir|pg||
nt|haans: Nicoleta|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Nicoleta, thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||
nt|paulg:  is this layout almost pre-destined?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: probably|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: do not balance in long in their suit = p have no points|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: now!!|pg||
nt|jallerton: well I suppose if anyone has an 8-card spade fit it's probably oppo|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: a lot off|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless they have already bid yours|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|nt|haans: here we see what who good it was to lead a further spade|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: very careless line|pg||
nt|lestergold: club now for maxi|pg||
nt|lestergold: is that not obvious?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already off two bad result|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: that and prev board could be a break point - in case OR find and makes 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: wrong Jack|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it all depends to pin stiff s K|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pelu: I have seen that the match in Women: Israel - Libanon didnt start - we had that problem 10 years ago - but I hoped that sport now overruled politic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold slam|pg||
nt|jfaria: OK a good strugle now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have saved a trick drawing a trump at the end|pg||

nt|ady: but on heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sweden are recovering at a pace that could lead to a win|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||
nt|mamos: not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mamos: shed have preferred oppo to open 3@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: roland in it therefore|pg||
nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||

nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|pc|c7|pg||

nt|andyv:  have to bid those slams|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that will be a slightly fortuitous 13 imps to england|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not good|pg||
nt|haans: best sqz when only overtricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 more boards and new leader the netherlands|pg||
nt|vasmar: even 7@C is a good sacrifice over 6@S|pg||
nt|eweber: it is a pleasure to watch this match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||
nt|copeyj: X from Townsend showing 4+@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were missing 2 K |pg||
nt|ady: twins got into bother on jand 15   plaued 4@HX    losy 500 and 7 imps|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: good choice|pg||
nt|jfaria: 2@c precision style|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here again the last 2@c trend|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a huge hand for 10-12 NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: England are hurting|pg||
nt|lestergold: regret that i must leave now thx to my excellent fellow commentators well played Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H splinter|pg||

mb|p|nt|jfaria: Jan chooses the 8 card fit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||
nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||
nt|jfaria: he can now|pg||
nt|haans: a Gazzilli variation |pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: now they can play nt|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||

pc|cA|nt|haans: @CJ right|pg||

nt|rnmalik: makes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  almost looks like one round of bidding is missing|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend trying for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: my kind a play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: maybe South bid 3NT and North corrected?|pg||
nt|rmb1: England regain the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: just one off|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam and grandslam difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: edge intom it rather than leap|pg||
nt|copeyj: but dont think he can|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will make with @sK onside|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would seem to be normal|pg||
nt|haans: now thay have a little talk|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: no: 3@S by N = 3+ @S - System note 14 :):))|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the way Iceland bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: safe now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodvenn: where is trick 9?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: IMP are not like MP|pg||
nt|eweber: North has already shown 11 HCP, making it easy to know that all Qs are in S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vasmar: he plays safely to ruff 4th spade if they split 4-2|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|pauleger: operator, pls check the score of bd 16 - with that line of play it was -3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i expect slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: seems anti flannery hand with east|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|h_karluk: pass and 2N asks feature etc etc|pg||
nt|haans: a kibs say Witch)|pg||
nt|paulg:  37-22 imps equates to 18-12 VPs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep but no comments:) K@S scores at 4@S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a passive @D lead would have been more challenging, but i think declarer can survive even then|pg||
nt|copeyj: a strong @C for Gromov this time|pg||
nt|copeyj: as we discovered before, pass from Dubinin shows 5-8|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think thats what robin told us|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodvenn: 30 minutes left on the round clock|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzns: yes it is - 3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1@h overcall then pass quite normal tho opener there|pg||

nt|copeyj: see you all later|pg||

nt|lestergold: thx cu Simon |pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|rmb1: thanks Simon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s great sort of distortion|pg||
nt|jallerton: West going for the surprise value|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: scoring still not perfect|pg||
nt|jfaria: 2@d must show majors, i think|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think a conservative bid by w|pg||
nt|haans: Witch was invented by two swedish ladies 10 years after Gazzilli was invented|pg||
nt|eweber: just got a hint from a spectator, there was a way to beat it 2 times|pg||
mb|d|nt|pauleger: okay thx Thierry|pg||
nt|ady: england have got big swings on 2 slam hands   one 50-50 and are fortunate to be ahead |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think Gold is scared that they may have missed a game and doesnt want to push his luck knowing they cannot outbid e/where|pg||
nt|jallerton: prepared to look very silly|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: working on it|pg||
nt|eweber: playing the 3rd club results in a trump promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: meaningful swing to England|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: South can play the 4th and N can ruff high|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/FlanneryAntiVariation.html|pg||
nt|jallerton: but here 4@h has 4 losers on a @d lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, this is a strange decision - does Townsend think he is behind?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: small @H now, but declarer will probably guess to put up the King|pg||
nt|haans: yes danes not easy to fool :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 tricks likely here - so net gain of 820|pg||
nt|copeyj: 13 imps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: A reasonable game.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pauleger: an easy make (hopefully this time)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: Are they still happy?|pg||
nt|haans: lose a trick|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jfaria: im told 2@d= 11-14 5-5 8-14 5-4 |pg||
nt|jfaria: hard to W to guess...|pg||
nt|vasmar: he has 4 good cards in majors|pg||
nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||
nt|jfaria: those calls are ackward to meet when weak and get strong fit, otherwise a very big gap to to fill|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems random to me with no outside entry, even if his minor values are soft|pg||
nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said at the start, this result will count in the second round robin as well as teams only play the qualifiers from the other group|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why can't they start at the same time each day?|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 am 12.30 pm your time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: is it possbible that West had King xx?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe they are having a party tomorrow|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: how could he|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a change from two years ago|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodvenn: desperate but correct|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|eweber: South plays the 4th club after coming in whith the 1st round of trumps, of course|pg||
mc|9|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|dburn: tricky, this - 4@s was given a chance to make at the other table, but declarer misread the end position (quite understandably)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: South never shifted to hearts, so declarer could (and did) eliminate everything and play a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|brolucius: On my conversion scale of 20 IMPs = 1 goal, England is 2-1 in the lead. (I believe this to be a reliable guide for tomorrow's result.)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|dburn: but when a heart was returned she ducked, playing South for @hKx or @hQx|pg||

nt|vasmar: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|jfaria: again Majors ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes because of the spades|pg||
nt|mamos: meanwhile NS judged well on Board 18|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|copeyj: 2@H here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: might be a delicate contract though|pg||
nt|copeyj: i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: ew will bid game i think|pg||
nt|eweber: right, I am wondering whether their strong club system made things difficult or possible here...|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|4S|nt|haans: 2!GH 3 card support 11-13|pg||
nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodvenn: 3 nt is a natural contract which will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult hands to bid n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: altho townsend may double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: too much of his hand in @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock by mistake sorry|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

nt|mamos: if not North will be endplayed |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: perhaps N expected to find S with xx xxx xx xxxxxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Mari-Volcker(France) and Stockdale/Brown (Eng ladies) made 6@d I hear|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||

pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: Fucik worked for that|pg||

nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende.  Great concentration!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: East had a  horrid position   - played South for Kx  which in a way was consistent with her defence  dont know what 1@H from North meant|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||

nt|eweber: operator, what is going on here?|pg||
