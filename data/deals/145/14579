nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||

pc|h4|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||

nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||

nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||

nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||

nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||

nt|hedyg: David are you implying that Lohay should have ruffed with the jack?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: lol, I was wondering|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was not kidding when he threw me 19,81 meters down a slope 22 years ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyone for Michaels with that North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead not a big sucess that time|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- anything else might have made declarer sweat a bit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to prawdopodobne wielce|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi Vassilis|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vassilis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not rue, as i said, cashing winners and exiting in clubs leads to the same overtrick at no risk|pg||
nt|mamos: strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did not know that the Marx Brothers were involved|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|GF|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= gf|pg||
nt|stc: italy in 5@d on board 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe reach 7H|pg||
nt|mamos: control showing response|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: wg mnie to spory blad powiedziec 1 ba - E po 2 treflach opsa da kontre T.o a spasuje na 2kier, 2 karo |pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict 6 though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||

nt|brolucius: Is the 1@H rebid forcing, David?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: East might figure out that leading a diamond might give the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: pokazujac sile ok 9 PC|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess they're cuebids|pg||

nt|hedyg: disc a @H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: a wish trick |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin's comment breaches copyright, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
nt|stc: the two black Q's in S will probably score|pg||
pc|dK|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told this gives the scores:  for running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|iain sime: Meanwhile, East has done too much opposite a balancing double I think. Oh, and come on Germany!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking probably not a winner but Madala is unaware of the bad splits|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: Is there one for group B ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt ok for me..|pg||
nt|brolucius: That says it all. Englishmen want Murray to do well at Wimbledon. Scots want England to lose to Germany. Sad!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No matches at Wimbledon today I hear, that solves one problem|pg||
nt|stc: just switch some of those Q's|pg||
nt|iain sime: It will mean that we will be able to watch the rest of the tournament without being bombarded with references to 1966 for a start.|pg||

nt|iceblue: This is the last round|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is just the price you pay for inverted minors.|pg||
nt|athene: competing to 3 over 3 would be very wrong if north had fewer clubs|pg||
nt|athene: another 2@D opener - if he is given the chance|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 3NT for NS  is par on this one|pg||

nt|andyv:  the insomniac coup works well early in the morning?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Versace are in 4@S on board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||
nt|lesniak: lepiej bylo z karta adama otw 1 trefl i stanac w 1-2 pik:(:(|pg||
nt|bagman: Here 2M might be considered overbidding|pg||
nt|iain sime: "three was too high partner"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|capercliff: i can assure you the other room will be longer, Ash and Goodman not known as speed demons|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||
nt|bagman: especially if N is known to attack on opening lead|pg||
nt|lesniak: choc nie chcialbym uslyszec po 1 trefl np 1 ba lub 2 karo  od partnera|pg||

nt|marlowepi: first u have to bid it, then they have to lead a nonclub|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding on the last deal was instructive. When you compete for a part-score, responder should be very wary of undoing your good work by going too high.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really if he counted N's hcps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bagman: might have gone for 200 undoubled|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@h be E easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|!H support|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|iceblue: NS play prec, EW 2over1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT game-forcing with support I assume|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: 3NT balanced minimum|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 1@s was pretty normal? 4@s is maybe a better contract|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||

nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk4: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||
nt|xenya: how can Hofta bid 6 without  knowing about the @C support?|pg||

nt|xenya: AKxx?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
nt|bagman: N is likely to lead a heart whether W bids hearts or not; just for a different reason|pg||
nt|lesniak: 3 pik=krotkosc- ale nie jestem pewien czy obaj tak mysla|pg||

nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no insurance taken out|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid by charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure Madala's approach was right tactically|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||

nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||

nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no risks|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was all the more reason for North to lead a heart, looking for a ruff, because the Italian auction had been confident - including some cue bids.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||

nt|stc: and, as in the case of Madala you may play for different countries|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||

nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||

nt|atabey: that was a strong hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: other table playing 6|pg||
nt|othered1: i think 6@H was right on last hand, given far less than high likelihood of @D lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what W dbld on unless it was to stop pd from bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS may have missed chance of +800 ..but got +850  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Are you saying Pass is forcing? :P|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: After 7 compared boards a 60 IMP lead would be 25-0 with 9 IMPs to spare|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have the right bd?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same with Meckstroth and Rodwell, and the great Italians.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As yesterday, the speed of play is impressive.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably knew but was considering that the contract cannot go down unless he can cash another @H trick|pg||
nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the description of the play siuggests a NT contract, probably N bid 2N over 2S|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Muppet Stayman at the other table|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I asked him after the claim and he said 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if he claims 9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, he took @DK and heaved a sigh of relief|pg||

nt|lesniak: jesli partner ma 4 ta 10 ke to jest bez znaczenia|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky 4@S here|pg||
nt|gohar: not tricky|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D might just shut out the spades.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pasker: they need to avoid 3NT on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have (reasonably) ducked the 2nd @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NS may defend in 5@d|pg||
nt|iain sime: May not find spades if North bounces.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But 2@D seems right on those values, with the dubious heart honours.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 5@ds, 4@s and 1@c|pg||
nt|capercliff: playing the K was bound for going off if they were not breaking, ducking was the safety play|pg||

mb|d|nt|brolucius: Some would bid 3@H, a mini-splinter (which would give South much more information).|pg||
nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until we see 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suffered the connection problems that I mentioned 45 minutes ago. Obviously the exorbitant £17.99 that I pay for Boardband each month is not considered sufficient for a good ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: service.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know for sure that had N bid 3@s, S would have raised to 4, playing the principle of 5-8|pg||
nt|jtr: Entries to play @ss are a problem here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, experience and probability are neighbours, aren't they? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: no|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N try to sneak a @h now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, just like u and me! |pg||
nt|andyv:  for running scores|pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllllll famous last words|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did consider rising with the @SA... for about 0.0001 milliseconds.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely played by Bocchi|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for a @H stopper|pg||
nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iain sime: Not sure about this line. the heart king was an entry.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: I guess that this will played to the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Versace had somehow found a way to duck the @d, it would have put a lot of pressure on N|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|brgpro: after E has shown 3@s, he knows the @h aren't breaking....well, actually he hopes they wont break...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphznk: It seems the contract is indeed 4@S, I missed a part, sorry all|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhh ok ty Bas|pg||

pc|dK|nt|lesniak: i tyle by bylo...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pasker: as pointed out by spec the 9@S is going to be good enough on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Ducking would have been double dummy play; imagine partner with AJxx(x)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brgpro: that would be a quick one down, even without @h ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: hoping for some clues or helpful discards|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must be careful now in the trump suit. Yes, well played!|pg||
nt|mamos: pretty sure @H finesse is wrong now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too many @H's discards from W |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: declarer had no chance to set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: as dummy was short of entries|pg||
nt|athene: but now he is running seriously short of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even though west only has two obvious winners (@CA, trump)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 8, not 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W held his diamonds because N might have had diamond ace instead of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N still has the chance of a defensive error earlier, i.e. E failing to unl;ock spade ten from QTxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a diamond exit would see him home|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  yes...Lauria would have had to lead something other than the 5@d to give Versace a chance to duck|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is a disadvantage of leading low from 10xxx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mamos: east not thinking???|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: another canape sequence here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky club position|pg||
pc|h4|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
pc|cA|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||
nt|bagman: ok the old trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie wszyscy majatak¹ szansê- niektorzy np Francuzi graja ,¿e 2 tref i po 2 karach 2 kier jest inwituj¹ce|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: S put lead to dummy to score the @CK|pg||
nt|sybarra: just not my style |pg||
pc|sT|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
pc|s4|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||

nt|atabey: 2@d will be final contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Scuzi|pg||
nt|mbruun: I just dont like that pattern|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The textbooks say that you have one heart too many and one spade too few for a take-out double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wrote it myself in 1991|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But "those who can, do, those who can't, write the textbooks"|pg||
nt|capercliff: that is a funny Question, which one is the junior:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Do people still play a 16-18 NT? Apparently|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What about Chandler's Ford, David?|pg||
nt|atabey: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: I must have the wrong convention card for NS.  It calls for 1@C opening on south's hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody forces Zorlu to anything|pg||
nt|athene: this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: ... Lavazza girls ... lol|pg||
nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wouldn't this be a 2@D overcall then?|pg||
nt|iain sime: My experience is the same as David's.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he only needs to maake it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought 3@C two highest remaining, cuebid two most extreme and 2NT the two lowest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: sometimes you catch Txxxxx with partner and 22. or you may find Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d would be majors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, he had 2@D out of the box and on the table|pg||

nt|brolucius: The kibitzer who told me those scores must be psychic then.|pg||
nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i think Mossop could have a played a higher card than the 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: though*|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: disapointment, when dummy shows (and doubly so with the @CJ there)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/turkey/zorlu-assael.pdf|pg||
nt|mbruun: I would hesitate for 30 sec and pass. That shows 3343 and 15HCP in my system|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: I thought that range died in the 60's|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, I was referring to group B running scores :)|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|mamos: this is dead dead dead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@D is ambiguous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another diamond will kill it now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't come back to his hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he can see that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looking at dummy @d is his only chance!|pg||
nt|stc: a BIG point now|pg||
nt|iain sime: This doesn't work if a diamond is played. The squeeze would have worked- East had to keep all his black cards so declarer could have given up a spade.|pg||

nt|daman: now has to lose 3@Ssw|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|athene: this was always likely|pg||
nt|athene: even getting the heart away wasn't enough to make the game - declarer had to drop the club too to have a chance|pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: You were right Mike, the tables have turned ;)|pg||
nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Strange, everyone says -1 but I'm sure the play went as it went...|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||
nt|daman: now a @S game for EW|pg||

mb|1D|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||

nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||
nt|mamos: Blue Club type strong Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasted into it at other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||

nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict they will reach it here now|pg||
nt|stc: When E has only 6 cards the dec has not more trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||

nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||

nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 tricks off the top and a 6th if they don't squander their @d communications|pg||
nt|andyv:  N on lead so trot out his AK@h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: If NS are happy with their methods, I see no reason why we should judge them|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well it wasnt a terribly confident auction, but still...opps are NV which means smaller penalty and also less likelihood EW have done something very overambitious|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I have mentioned before. Marc Smith tells me that in his system there is no way to avoid 3NT with 11 opposite 11. The responding hand raises the 2NT rebid to 3NT, in case opener ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||
nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brgpro: seems it showed @s |pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hedy has to allow time for a restaurant lunch before the Portugal-Brazil game. |pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a lead directing over call!|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it transfer to hts?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
pc|c6|nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not Madala's set, 30 of the 31 IMPs were caused by wrong decisions |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nope, he just sat there and thought, playing the @C5|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No kibs, I wasn't tricking you... I would|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *I would've long undid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Undone even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or we could say that 30 of the 31 IMPs to Norway came after good decisions by Brogeland|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'How did you do in your match against Italy?'  'Let me show you a deal where I got Duboin three down in 3NT'.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was impressed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "What a player"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that he is:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT is not a lucky contract this session, 80% of the times it was played it went down at this table|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Zivkovic left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by Versace this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising, as you say.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Lebanon... interesting that their pick ups have been when they've been quiet:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS don't open 2@D as 18-19 BAL with 5cM?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: either way, we have a close match now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very intgeresting deals in this set|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like a standard 4@S|pg||
nt|coolvijay: seems a routine spade game for N-S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  i guess they were thinking more of Meckwell than Scotland|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of potential hear, EW can make various games|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Seven certain tricks and the senior suit to bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Open room has recorded 2@H+2 on this board.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is not what it appears|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is either weak or strong with hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  very strong NT here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mbruun: Notice Sementas initial pass with 12 bal and no aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for a 2@D overcall by S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes, quite a few|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And not Brogeland either we now see|pg||
nt|lesniak: prognozuje 1 imp dla naszych|pg||
nt|snetram:  a nawet 2|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczylem ,¿e E nie powie 2 kier|pg||
nt|iain sime: But look how many they can take against 4@S if they find a couple of ruffs.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c is best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, but do you know that?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: West will not go mad, facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa: "Pass 1NT?" Duboin: "No, -1. Pass 3@C!"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk5: It's not balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 5-card majors|pg||
nt|mbruun: Despite of the evil heartsplit both games are makeable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha yup|pg||
nt|xenya: but the double looks OK|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2@C = various meanings, in which one of them can be a 3 card 8+ raise|pg||
nt|antoniz: liczê,¿e Adam spasuje|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: Maybe 5422 is to bad|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Bas|pg||
nt|bagman: They might play 16-18|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think that on the last hand it had anything to do with luck   or on some of the others|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: a @c lead was needed to beat 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 5+@hs 4-18|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@c may be Drury or natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he really wants to protect the K@s|pg||
nt|stc: 800 available but hard to collect|pg||
nt|iain sime: 5@D ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: South can place declarer with a double stopper in clubs and is considering if he can cast his net elsewhere.|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer needs to play reasonably well to go one down.|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz trzeba kiery impasowaÄ damÄ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ruff D, king of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@D= 8+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We had a 5-0 this morning; unfortunately for Denmark, the Danish player bid his 5-card suit and kept the opponents out of their 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ciao Giorgio|pg||

nt|capercliff: tell them at the table Bas?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I signaled it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|atabey: for the turkish spectators: our women team is up 46-1 for now. I thk against the chech republic|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||
nt|brolucius: South must look for a card to suggest a diamond switch.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order not to risk further penalties|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: as S has no 4th D, E is in control|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|snetram:  remis|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|stc: yes but if they play twice @c and @h S is endplay after the @d ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: OR same 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Important to pick up every available trick in defence when opponents have 650 in the bag already.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Zorlu play another @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes and declarer played the @Cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bogier: wszystko przez ocene K karo, który wydaje sie kiepski- a jest swietny|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodvenn: If North has the J9 of trumps, the contract is down|pg||
nt|iain sime: Cracked it!|pg||
nt|stc: oops, a new communication opened|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Was 5 originally, but an appeal gave both teams 2 VPs back|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Against a high heart to request a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H was a mistake |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mamos: had another chance|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodvenn: and if he has the Jack +x declarer may make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  eventually he will lead trump|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: The equation is simple now, although no doubt South expects the spade finesse to fail|pg||
nt|pasker: should be ok for +1 now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|bagman: he was always ok with @SK in the pocket|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: that's it for NS   no more tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: unless EW blocks the @Ds|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 8 might take a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: he just did not know it before :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dA|nt|bagman: Now it's over; 1 down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: easy overtick all the time with both black key cards right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: small error by declarer, and this is a valuable technical point -- as E in this situation you do NOT want to lead the 7-spot on the second round. always lead from the top in these ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: situations, so that the person showing out of trumps doesnt know how many trump tricks the defence have coming. often makes no difference, but good to get in habit of playing right ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: card|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||

nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see why he didnt|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: can he get the pitches |pg||
pc|c2|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||

nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: this will roll now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was always rolling i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: with ace of @D on side yes |pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had five double-figure swings to Italy on the first six boards. Since then only a dribble of IMPs. A margin 51 or more is needed for a maximum win in VPs.   |pg||

nt|mdgraham: not sure South does either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||

nt|marlowepi: play it always|pg||
nt|mamos: i think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our brilliant operator (with sticky key board) Bas |pg||
nt|iain sime: Switzerland pick up 21 imps in two hands. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT fair enough, no good rebid if 1@c opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, whatever we think the odds for or against Madala's 5@H, let us not forget the fine judgement of West on the deal.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes indeed!|pg||
nt|stc: or just go on the officail site, click result and runing scores|pg||

nt|hedyg: Bas? a problem?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even for Swiss supporters.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: The message we should all take away with us is that it is possible to play good bridge at high speed. (Easier to play bad bridge slowly, I agree.) |pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Orange (Dutch team's nickname) played badly as well, but at least we got out with 1-0 and 2-0 victories :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1level Italian overcalls can be very weak|pg||
nt|othered1: they feel strongly about getting in at the 1-level.  Failure to do so is meaningful.|pg||

nt|atabey: this is not one of them thou. 6-4 with a decent suit. standard I thk|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: (Obviously I didn't disturb Versace during play btw)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR seems to be playing in 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I am a Dry Stone Waller, all day long I Dry Stone Wall. Of all appalling callings, Dry Stone Walling's worst of all (Pam Ayres)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our gratitude to the China Contract Bridge Association (CCBA) for ensuring that this event was brought to BBO vugraph. Mr Song Zhao has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, but not polite to boast about it. Think about the French and English supporters...|pg||
nt|bagman: N is not going to sit, I guess|pg||

nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||
nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||

nt|mamos: why did this fail?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to make 7 tricks here for -100|pg||
nt|bagman: This is more like no limit poker :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Who's got the biggest balls|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble, says North!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h weak looks ok to me as a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Finesse onside|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: so should lose two spades and a heart from here, for a boring 110|pg||
nt|andy_h: The cc only says 2@C is stayman, not sure what 3@C is|pg||
nt|brolucius: An exciting auction!|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR has finished|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is in the nice position that it doesn't matter how many tricks he makes as long as he makes at least 6|pg||
nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for shape  3@D  3343 or 3334  3@H asking  3NT  3334   If Bocchi had four diamonds, Madala might have been interested in slam|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still plenty of vugraph today. The Swiss Cup Jean Besse from Geneva just started. 48 boards to be played there|pg||
nt|brgpro: in talking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, China women lost to Singapore|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland will Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
nt|bagman: West had a very marginal T/O X by passed hand. With the @DQ changed to @HQ, he would have doubled, I think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|capercliff: play to drop QJ stiff before trying for 3@s tricks|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Fayad has left the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bas.. how much time for the last 4 boards?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 40 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make here 3@H guessing the hearts if defense attacks clubs in time|pg||
nt|andyv:  most of cards lie well for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Chance for Lithuania there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 67-8 it's a cricket score, but not a very good one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For the bowling side it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've heard Duboin mention "idiota" several times now, any translations (not from Google)? :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: another exciting hand!|pg||
nt|sharkey: 9-2 Slovakia first 5 boards this half...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha, nice deal|pg||
nt|sharkey: A plus score looks good on this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We're only 5 minutes past half time btw, this table is blitzing the boards|pg||
nt|vasmar: setting opponent's contracts in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I'm more of a Multi-Lousy person|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's true that 5@D could be better if declarer has something like 2-3-4-4 and the spades *might* be wide open, but you can never be able to find out if partner's 2 card spade suit ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: might have an honour or even the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H can be made by East, not West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas, you flirting again??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: 18-19 HCP, balanced|pg||
nt|bagman: In time means either leading or after @SK|pg||
nt|rodvenn: what to bid as east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: what happened to Fantunes?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Surely Bocchi passed and Hofta opened 1@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: 2@d=18-18 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Ed|pg||
nt|bagman: (or @DA)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it means "you are a charming person, partner"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Possibly :$|pg||
nt|bagman: The hearts are nicely for South with only one loser there|pg||
nt|bogier: co operator chyba skusi³ w poprzednim na drugim stole|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh my!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Don't you speak Italia?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italian even|pg||
nt|mbruun: Idi means cue, ota is bid, so he was wondering if it was a cuebid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't think kibs do, they're spamming me saying: what you are, or something similar :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South wants to re-re-double|pg||
nt|sharkey: link to running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|sharkey: for Open A|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the previous deal it seems that declarer banked everything on a finesse of the @DQ. He might have tried the @D9 first, falling back on a later finesse of the @DQ if that failed.|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  taking the low road will keep Lauria out of trouble|pg||
nt|bridge_one: note the open of 1@H by Lauria (safe) instead a preemptive|pg||
nt|andyv:  S likes his 10hcp and dbl @h stopper|pg||
nt|pasker: W might also be thinking about whether to compete|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think W is done|pg||
nt|pasker: likely to have a fit in 1 of the minors but is difficult to get to p to chose the right one|pg||
nt|andyv:  marginal hand and void in pd's suit doen not make that a good offensive hand.|pg||
nt|pasker: and a void @H is an obvious downside|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He played partner's pass to be for penalties|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Typo :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: 430|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Excellent - the Lithuanians bid the spade slam  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a great rule I can recommend for working out whether partner has passed a redouble for penalties|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is gf nat or balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy slam in a black suit here if East can showing his singleton heart|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Is this the right board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent bridge, many redoubles|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would want to bid one of my majors here but seems to be a mix up?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c may show extras?|pg||
nt|jbgood: actually a di ruff can always be administered in a heart contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H by East can also be defeated if you are psychic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and want to be in the newspapers and magazines|pg||
nt|rodvenn: already well done. but impossible to reach 6?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: This is likely to go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c overcall by W might not be a favorite by all|pg||
nt|bagman: Requires something like @DA and diamond and then heart finesse to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have this hand to discuss at length later as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is exactly 5-4 with 15 hcps|pg||
nt|bagman: With xxx in diamonds, N expects fit to some suit as S probably has at most xx in diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D are makeble, 3@h no|pg||
nt|bagman: With a higher spot than @H7, South might get an idea (I know N is passed)|pg||
nt|pasker: S may even be able to promote the @H7 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|bagman: if he had 3 trump tricks and the defensive values in the minors, X might net sometimes 300, which is 5IMPs better than 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: other room found 4@S, to their regret as cards lie.|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder what 3@s means?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S= short in @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided to stay one level lower - not making pref to @C|pg||
nt|bagman: 3@C would have been an easier make I guess (needing 4 club tricks)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|daman: transportation is an issue on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 @S may turn out ok as well|pg||
nt|bagman: The spades are nicely but the clubs need to be worked on|pg||
nt|bagman: More chances to go wrong in 2 spades. In 3@C the line of play is sortof forced|pg||
nt|bagman: and if you double only contracts which go down, you double too seldom|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's interesting how aggressive NS have been in the bidding but not in the doubling.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: ah 2NT opened|pg||
nt|brgpro: everyday i learn something new.....what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: and what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c KC?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s 2 without?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now it is completely dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double is Lightner, asking for an unusual lead, normally dummy's suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule to "pass" is frequently a good rule :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's always nice when you get to ruff with your singleton trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = "Partner, I have a void, your job to figure out where"|pg||
nt|xenya: might go 2 off -- not that it matters much|pg||
nt|bagman: defense is often the hard part of the game and to make marginal doubles one has to rely on good defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
nt|antoniz: poziom operatorów jest pora¿aj¹cy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Pekka - 3@C more of a "coffee" hand|pg||
nt|bagman: now N has quite clearcut AK clubs |pg||
pc|d2|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: South found out that 3@H was not a risk-free bid.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
nt|bogier: a u nas juz trenuje ekipa operatorów na przysz³oroczne ME w Poznaniu :)|pg||

nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||
nt|stc: Madala is learning fast, this time he passed :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala has had enough of making risky heart bids.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pay-back time |pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas will insert result on 16 when he gets a minute. Please be patient|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|sharkey: shud make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 2x diamonds, @CT and club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump promotion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib says no..|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can risk 3@H on some hands with a suit like that, but a bit dodgy with 3-2-2 on the side.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: ruff!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphznk: Done|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: game over|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Rare misdefense by Sementa|pg||
nt|bagman: he probably did not believe that the declarer would take that line with that hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: and their auction is what we'd see from many standard system players.  Some weak NTers might get to 3N after 3@S by east, but from the other side.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he would have lost three trumps tricks when trumps were breaking very favourably for him.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Scoring up: "We have 430" .... "How did you make an overtrick in 3NT"?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as 1@c can be a balanced 19-23, I reckon South thought that that was what North had, and that he would bid with any other type|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one at the table was sure of the score lol|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bas|pg||
nt|brolucius: US kibitzers find the word 'dodgy' amusing or perhas archaic. Has not yet crossed the Atlantic, it seems.|pg||

nt|andy_h: make sure you have clear agreements of when it applies and which suit does it imply|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Of course, no-one would ever question your integrity. You are just a neutral observer|pg||

mb|1N|nt|othered1: Italy's lead reflects very solid play|pg||

nt|stc: 124 IMP on 18 borads, what a show !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 124 IMPs exhanged in 17 boards; it definitely has not been boring|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||
nt|bagman: in the days of old when vugraphs were theaters one of my frinds was playing a tough contract. In a critical situation he heard the chanting from the theatre: "DROP IT, DROP IT" and ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played for the drop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||

nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it was a fine auction, even if a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: There's actually a VG theatre here, but it's well isolated from the playing area :)|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but Multilandy better, because selfdescribing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||
nt|antoniz: karo proszê,a widzisz wiara czyni cuda:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by lauria at 2@s is a raise in @D in decent hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: in OR W passed and left th bidding open for opps|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Turkey-Switzerland there was a noble push in 6@S bid and made.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  a fast claimer... could actually make 4 if he believes E's dbl showed @hs|pg||

nt|andyv:  maybe 3N?|pg||
nt|iain sime: The so- called Aiberdeen double. 3 cards in each take out suit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a normal A@H lead how do you make 4@s?|pg||

nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S are possible also without K@H lead, if South don't play @h but @D|pg||
nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is looking for a sacrifice somewhere, but doubles instead of 4NT in case partner prefers to pass.|pg||
nt|stc: another big point !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North will pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to find a bid..|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3Nt is the best spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||

nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||

pc|sA|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||

pc|s3|nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bagman: South has two chances to play hearts before the elimination postion develops|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes and Fantoni made a killing at a NABC tourney in the US by playing 5 3N contracts holding 5-4 major suit fits... it was right every time!|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table North did make a trump trick, of course, but declarer was able to ditch two hearts on the established @CK-Q.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pasker: safe lead from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s for @d|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||

nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: South and West are screen mates|pg||
mb|3C|nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: They might get overboard to keep the Italy supporters happy.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us in a most entertaining set of boards... the bridge may not have been perfect but there was a lot of excitement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 4pik|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe Italy doesn't get 25Vps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Bas, great job as usual!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps was not sure about 4@s, natural or short ?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Transfer responses after an interference of an opening bid, hence 1@H=5+@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but a very entertaining fight!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas, Vladimir, Andy, Jon, Christian and Martin|pg||
mb|6H|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
nt|stc: W opened 2NT, you have 5@ss, hard to believe that partner has 5+@s and no @c fit !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure whether Zivkovic alerted 3@D, I would assume so|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
pc|c4|nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure Roland, I enjoyed it :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
