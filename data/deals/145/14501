nt|flash: we're in the Chicago suburbs for the last segment of the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|migry: this may be a small swing to welland if they get too high in the other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team was originally seeded 20th out of 23 entering teams, a remarkable feat to be 15 boards away from the semis|pg||
nt|flash: the Weinstein team is certainly the surprise of the tournament|pg||
nt|migry: 1NT - 2@d - 2@h -2NT - whatever|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: On the last board, EW played 4@h from East (East opened 1@h) so didn't have to guess the clubs, picking up 10 IMPs|pg||

nt|phil: yes I had to leave with about 3 left in the 2nd - it was getting really ugly for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfj: hiya Harmon, Weinstein had the wheels come off a bit last segment, this will be a key test to see if they can restore some momentum|pg||
nt|harmon: looks like|pg||
nt|harmon: it|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: we had lots of slam hands in the previous set - this is the first one here|pg||
nt|harmon: lotsa bds left|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Jacki: Welcome to our commentator Phil Clayton everyone :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Good morning Phil :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|phil: with 70 left, I wouldn't say 60 IMPs is nothing, but it is against a good team playing well, that had the benefits of rest|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: dont think there's any way to make 7|pg||
nt|flash: for security reasons, each match has its own set of hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstien will need some hands to break their way and to "swing" on |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: that doesn't allow for comparisons across matches, but avoids many and severe headaches...|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hi Jacki :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Very odd to see that J weinstein Passed with 12 HCP and 5@h on the first board, led to them ending up in 4@s -1, not a dream start|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: Moss upgrades a lot, but many would agree with not calling this a "17"|pg||
nt|phil: cant imagine anything but 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: roy thought 4n was quantitative|pg||
nt|bobh1: is that what chris intended?|pg||
nt|migry: it is quantitative|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: that would be the 'std' interpretation|pg||
nt|migry: they play 14-16 NT |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|phil: Im pretty sure what everyone plays, but I'll look up their cc's to make sure |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|migry: so 17 (even prime 17) is not enough to DRIVE to slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: ok forgot about their slightly lighter range|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  being 70 imps behind, EW may have to change a little to create some action|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  unfortunately the 3@s bid may backfire on them|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is an easy make, well not easy but it will come home. 3@sX was slated for 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had passed, it's doubtful game would have been reached by NS|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|andyv:  in CR, W opened 3@d and E raised to 4... N contiued to 5@d over partner's dbl... down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: None of the West players passed the hand - 2 opened 2 and 2 opened 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  The double and the lead pretty much place the rest of the cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the cost is only 2 additional imps|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@s is the right preempt at this vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was my point... if you are trying to create swings, you have to take chances on some hands and go anti field|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I take that back, only one player (Hamman) opened 2, the other 3 opened 3 |pg||
nt|henryb:  the real anti-field action is pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|henryb:  So the swing is Greco's 3N|pg||
nt|henryb:  With no spare entries Greco should play the Q from dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think the swing was passing 3Nx - Rodwell pulled to 4@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gitelman was the only E to raise 3@s to 4, getting beyond 3NT|pg||

nt|migry: so EW will open 1@C with balanced hands that contain a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not to mention light|pg||
nt|migry: this is sort of a normal opening|pg||
nt|phil: true; but the defense could have taken the club earlier and achieved that, but the position is murky to South at T3|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|migry: and you want to get that suit in|pg||
nt|bobh1: for them you mean right?|pg||
nt|migry: wouldn't be too happy if the opponents bid 1NT-3NT and take the first 9 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: this isnt right|pg||
mb|d|nt|scotty: Usually at imps, you will be play safely for your contract - unless very sure it wil be ok to do otherwise|pg||
nt|phil: or maybe it is....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: for some reason people this week are questioning my input more than usual :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes,  4 @S might not be everyones bid|pg||
nt|phil: bonanza available in 4@s x'd here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i would be happy to open that one even when playing "semi solid" openings|pg||
nt|migry: 1@h= S|pg||
nt|migry: not sure Roy saw the double by North|pg||
nt|bobh1: what would 1@s by roy show?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|scotty: I think Diamond decided to use the favorable vulnerability to try and make life tough for N-S|pg||
nt|phil: hi Mini  :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Roy definetely saw the double.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N bids and he did |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: franco is looking at 5-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so maybe they play the same after a double|pg||
nt|phil: 2N feels like an underbid|pg||
nt|phil: 5@d looks normal, but with 2 big cards, and a stiff, isnt a pass tempting? |pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: or maybe wanted to stress that @d suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: no high cards but his partner is bidding his head off|pg||
nt|scotty: N might have tried 3N there - but it's definitely tougher than if Diamond had passed and left N-S to bid their 26 HCP to 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be indeed |pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: they have to guess the right lead here|pg||
nt|migry: good pass |pg||
nt|migry: east may try the KS and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|migry: A@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they will get it right but it aint over yet|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he leads the @s A Roy will be able to give suit pref|pg||
nt|migry: i bet on the AS lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: how much pressure was pard under?  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|scotty: There is a lot of risk and randomness associated with Diamond's action there - but here he must be credited with generating a swing out of nothing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|flash: very costly at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: this was one no one was guessing he would lead|pg||
nt|phil: answer = not very when we are w/r|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil: a rare misstep for NS - they have been very strong for Weinstein|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: Im kind of surprised Platnick didnt raise|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|scotty: Well partner could have the same hand with a king less - and then game rates to be poor|pg||

mb|3H!|an|4 !hs, 5 !ss, FG|nt|henryb:  and somewhat tricky to play right on this layout.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  not right, but successfully|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  W needs to make a couple of tries|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  3@h = 5@s, 4@h; 4@c = singleton and slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 5@d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein explained 4@c as shortness. B says "I wasn't sure if it was shortness or a control"|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: Kolesnik led the @SA in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|phil: 6@s is a tempting target on these cards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|scotty: North responds light, so as not to give E-W a free run|pg||
nt|phil: I know Josh Sher very well, and this comment doesnt surprise me - he instantly takes the charge which keeps the esprit d' corps intact|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: vulnerabilty and position ripe for stealing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|scotty: I like to play redeouble here as "competitive values, with doubleton in your suit"|pg||
nt|phil: any explanation on the xx? just cards? |pg||
nt|phil: good agreement to have|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: E might bid 3@d now and West....?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i believe written as doubleton heart but writting is microscopic|pg||
nt|phil: pass by Sher would also reveal a good hand, right? |pg||
mb|3H!|an|5!s 4!h|nt|flash: the quick claim overwrote the lead here - it was a trump...|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h is Smolen|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|scotty: I would actually play that 2@s is a better hand for spades - but that is not "standard"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and smolen is 5 @s/4 @H  |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: gotcha|pg||
nt|scotty: I'll be very impressed if Platnick passes here|pg||
nt|cherilou: E might sit for this|pg||
nt|phil: Michael, would you take the xx as a force beyond 2@s? |pg||
nt|scotty: Very difficult to "get" the opponents at the 2-level when they open and you are 3-3 in their suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: (pard bids his 4 card suit to get the 5 card suit played the nt hand if it can be played|pg||
nt|sybarra: one more try with 4 @D or 4 @C?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|scotty: Not a force in any way|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: then I think Platnick's pass of 2@s is dangerous - now he has to play catch up|pg||
nt|phil: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: "on the way" |pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: I wonder if 3N was available as some sort of slam try - either serious or non-serious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: by Moss|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Nickell now +76 vs Harris...   |pg||
nt|migry: "steaming"|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe not the best idea|pg||
nt|scotty: I wonder if Diamond was sure 4@d was natural?|pg||
nt|cherilou: what else would it be?|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't know, but he didn't raise.  He hadsn't shown any diamonds, and he (apparently) had shown a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|phil: like the last hand - a little NV action makes life tough for the pair with the cards |pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe he thought it was a splinter - or was at least a little worried|pg||
nt|cherilou: perhaps it was just a @H honor|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the N-S NT range?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Fred saying,  thx but no thanks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe not good enough for Serious 3 nt |pg||
nt|phil: rightly or wrongly I believe that if you are staring at the @sAK and partner tries for slam, you have an obligation to reciprocate|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jfeld: Hello|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi jason|pg||
nt|jfeld: Does double imply a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: now he has to make it|pg||
nt|migry: certainly not a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i dont think its lead directing at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: it says i think we're beating it|pg||
nt|bobh1: if his @hs were that good he would have overcalled|pg||
nt|jfeld: If it suggests a @H lead not so unreasonable, sort of a weird version of lead dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|jfeld: He know his partner is almost broke. I'm guessing he meant it as that.|pg||
nt|jfeld: with every suit stopped, actually pretty reasonable, especially as he knows he needs to generate a swing|pg||
nt|phil: 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i just looked at pad, i can confirm it showed 2 @H|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks Matt|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can make here, by eloping with club ruffs.  But this is a very difficult hand to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: but what do you bid Phil?|pg||
nt|phil: or they might not play it when one partner opens NT|pg||
nt|phil: dunno; 5@c or 5@s has appeal|pg||
nt|phil: or 4@h as last train if available|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil: feels like -1, the @cJ should help control the tap|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: everything is right on this hand, but etter doesn't know it, considering various options as he can't afford to lose a trick in hearts|pg||
nt|harmon: probably still his best option|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: with spades 3-3 and diamonds 4-3, he can afford to knock out the A@c and bank on spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hedge his bet, etter is asking about carding methods to try and smith etc. to try and get a read|pg||
pc|s3|nt|harmon: yes but it looks like d's 5-2 with erics false card|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is last train,  but frankly I perfer something like jx for that |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I meant 4 @H IF last train|pg||
pc|dT|nt|scotty: He doesn't rate to guess spades - N is almost a 2-1 favorite to hold the J|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|phil: Ive never heard a good definition of it, but in this context it must mean, "I have the club control you are worried about, and I like my hand, but I can't move by myself"|pg||
nt|sybarra: best definition I ever heard |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|scotty: S has an easy trump return - staying passive|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|phil: does he need to guess spades, after A@h, @h? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|migry: i think it's very reasonable, knowing the suits don't break well for declarer|pg||
nt|jfeld: I'm getting many votes for both I've got everything sewn up, don't give anything away, and also lead a @h|pg||
nt|migry: i believe tha the double should ask for a @h here|pg||
nt|migry: north either has 3 hearts or 4 horrible ones- for me always 3|pg||
nt|jfeld: 3 for me too|pg||

nt|flash: the difference when @Hs is the 2nd suit is that you may reach 4@H instead of stopping in 2@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you say the players are "arguing" about this Matt?|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks like a spade to the Q was an error, resulting in down - instead of a heart to endplay S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfj: roy felt misinformed in regards to his lead, feeling like if opps had a specific agreement that it showed 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bobh1: i see|pg||
nt|jfeld: and fortunately for Chris and Roy no overtricks, which is less likely after the invitational sequence, and his hand.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well we don't know who informed whom of what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: b4 the lead franco asked johnathan if that shows a 3 card accept with hearts, which was confimred, but, as 3nt would make anyway, they had no recourse|pg||
nt|scotty: Fair slam here for E-W - after the overcall, @sA is very likely onside, so you just need to find @dQ - about 57.5% a priori|pg||
mb|1S|nt|harmon: agrressive bid by geoff at these colors|pg||

nt|harmon: eric expecting more|pg||
nt|phil: think Brad just blasts here with the double fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|scotty: In practice for an expert the odds in 6N are usually even better - you may get information to guide you when you play out the hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|scotty: 2@d is natual here, not a raise - as if West opened another suit (since 1@d can be short)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: I am not sure he knows clubs "fit" yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: If E bids KC at some point, West COULD decide to show the trump Q - the fourth @d is big - he knows his partner is 5.  but it is a big risk|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: but looks like you are right |pg||
nt|phil: well, double is 'relative' :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5/5's are powerful |pg||

pc|c6|nt|jfeld: Interesting hand here with the bad breaks|pg||
nt|bobh1: entry management|pg||
nt|migry: i would call it a little ugly hand |pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfj: 6@C -6 at the other table, wow.|pg||
nt|scotty: W was worried he had 3 losers and was willing to stop below game.  E figured that if his partner could do no more than 4@d, slam could not be that good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|migry: although the defense is routine - establish your long suit, don't pitch winners|pg||

nt|scotty: With the result in the other room, slam is a REALLY bad proposition|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|phil: some interesting hands this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 10 boards to go|pg||
mb|2H|nt|scotty: E was thinking his partner was 4-4 in minors, and could discard a heart loser on the 5th @d if he played in the 4-4 club fit|pg||
nt|cherilou: opening 4@H would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 48  3nt for n/s in the other room |pg||
nt|phil: 6@c looks like a peeler, but theyll get plenty of action along the way|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: 1@c= either natural or balanced|pg||
nt|scotty: W was a little sleepy when he bid 6@c, I think.  Not sure what he was thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: The Weinstein team began play last Friday, and it seems Baseggio and Wesintein play a majority of the boards, fatigue certainly an issue with the grueling schedule|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Fred will bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|phil: I suppose but 2@h didn't help his hand one iota|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the X by N (should included spades)  will he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards always do the same thing |pg||
nt|phil: peeler - cold, icy - as is 7@c as was just pointed out to me (correctly)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: 1@d= heart|pg||
nt|scotty: now there is an interesting question of 5@h or pass then 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: bid my singletons or void |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S going slowing,  can S bid 3 @S?|pg||
nt|phil: 3@h might be clearer |pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: but its hard to say how good this is|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Of course here, S will bid 5@h if N passes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: if N puts in a 4 @C bid,  I think they n/s are off to the races,  as S will cue bid spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: presumably 1@s would imply better @cs|pg||
nt|migry: west could have bid 1@s to show 4-4 or 5-4 - 1@h shows a balanced minumum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @C by South  (I am going to quick guessing soon)  ..|pg||
nt|phil: well, credit the 2@s call for a lot of this|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: the lead gives Roy a chance?   @C lead into the opening bid too tough??|pg||
nt|phil: Sher is looking at a few spade losers and a club suit he doesnt know is running|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|migry: 1@s just shows an unbalanced hand - nothing about club quality|pg||
nt|sybarra: and credit is due to 2 @S |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|flash: but needed to play @Ss to take a couple pitches??|pg||
nt|flash: North back to same position as opening lead - @C or @HK to get rich; pointed suit no good|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Interestingly, in the Nickell match, on the previous board, Ralph Katz was in 6@d with north having bid a pre-emptive 2@s and thus misguessed the diamond suit for -1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|scotty: who was North?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: a 23 imp swing, chip martel |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil: this hand might have hit a seam for NS - both have some extras for sure|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: i would say likely yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|scotty: They have a big club fit, and each has some worries - S about spades, and N about both red suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, very likely will make 4@s on 18 HCP|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: if W had just rebid 1n E would pass|pg||
nt|flash: Nickell by 76 with 8 boards left|pg||

mb|2S!|an|Nat / GF|nt|migry: x= 4 or more spades 1S=3 cards|pg||
nt|scotty: I think Diamond should risk 2@s there.  He has a powerful playing hand, and might have game even facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: needs a trump lead to set it it looks like|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think south can envision a hand with few or no hts with N,  and S has no @S's,  doesnt a trump contract make sense?|pg||
nt|phil: modern treatment - a forcing 2@s call|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: yeah sry was lookig  at this one|pg||
nt|scotty: when you have a void, especially in their suit, you need to be much more aggressive|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|flash: looks like Nickell - Fleisher in one semi-final|pg||
nt|phil: no argument from me on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but he's aceless and Hamman's rule beckons|pg||
nt|sybarra: again, not a criticism or resulting (I hope)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: interestingly, in this hand 2@s might have allowed josh to bid 2nt which jackson would surely raise? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffing hearts seems safer than trying to work on the diamond suit, but he has a few options here|pg||
nt|phil: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agree with you last comment Phil |pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Seems asif N should do more here.  Partner's 2@s showed a maximum with shape, and he rates to have a stiff heart (even though he doesn't here)|pg||
nt|phil: 2N might be some kind of asking bid to clarify 2@s|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: Meckstroth also went down in 4@s playing a diamond up b4 eliminating clubs|pg||

nt|phil: bridge in the 21st century - you hold 22 real and the bidding starts 1@h - pass - 1N in front of you|pg||
nt|scotty: Eric Greco just pointed out, quite correctly, I think that I was wrong this whole time....|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Declarer's play also succeeds if West has both high hearts - so only THREE finesses losing is fatal - and that's 87.5%|pg||

nt|phil: 4-5 back to Weinstein Im guessing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|scotty: With his spade holding, he is not that interested in a club ruff|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfj: Willenken "allright roy, u better play the ____ out of this"|pg||

nt|scotty: N may feel @dA is enough to bid slam here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|migry: and i'm sure chris knows he's not winning this match|pg||
nt|scotty: And then Diamond will make a lighner double - against SLAM he definitely wants a club lead|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|scotty: Platnick was all set to lead his stiff in partner's suit - now he's thinking|pg||
nt|scotty: He may figure that, even if club void is more likely, if partner's void is in clubs his club holding might help beat slam even if he leads a @d.  Whereas if partner's void is in ...|pg||
nt|scotty: @d, not leading one is very likely fatal|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

nt|phil: well you dont know what is lurking on your left |pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: exactly - should be a value raise to 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: In the other room, East could have made life more difficult for N-S by overcalling 3@s.  His 2@s gave them no problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: over a strong 1@c in the other match, and a 3@s overcall, the bidding proceeded double, p 3nt, p 5nt, p 7nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: so yea, 2@s often does nothing it seems :)|pg||
nt|scotty: So they solved the problem, but I doubt if they were as secure as Fred and Brad, who got to KC and find out his partner had 3KC + @dK |pg||
nt|phil: which isnt too far off, but isnt showing clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and pard should hit the deck in 3 @D |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: The further the Weinstein team advances, the better i feel, they were the only team we beat in the round robin phase :)|pg||
nt|scotty: It is often profitable to preempt against strong artificial openings - opponents have less room to determine their fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 8 imps per board is not impossible if you get swingy hands|pg||
nt|phil: a tough game..cruel too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe n/w should be pards,  and e/s |pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: that's right you called it tough |pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: doesnt 4 @S look makeble here for e/w |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: the @D's flop nicely for  e/w |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: you also need a fighting spirit which apparently is not junior's currently|pg||

nt|phil: so, is double here support? |pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|flash: Nickell +73 with 5 boards left|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@d probably "at least 1 4-card M"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so likely 3 nt here |pg||
nt|phil: I vote its off over natural 1N overcalls, but on elsewise|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I look maybe it doesnt \|pg||
nt|phil: whatever your runout structure is, it should probably apply here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: alot of illegible writting, so something other then supp|pg||
mb|2C|nt|phil: I vaguely remember a Spingold match at Chicago in 05 (?) where a team was down by about 80 after 32, but lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does 6 @D make"|pg||
nt|sybarra: if I know these players, they not only write small, they write with light pencils, so you can barely see it |pg||
mb|2D|nt|migry: 6@d is interesting and makeable if you get the spades right|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have thought 4@c was gerber|pg||
nt|bobh1: for me it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only with the right view on spade suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: Matt,  what do you think,,  maybe e/w cant handle it all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hmm, on an 8 card fit, it's possible i suppose :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: looks like 5 realistically|pg||
nt|sybarra: (at leas that was what I remember as operator)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mslair: 4h must be last train|pg||
nt|ritong: notice that if east declares @ss, the @d singleton leads is disastrous for NS|pg||
nt|phil: Hampson / Greco got to 4@c but it required Hamspon to wade out to the 4 level over a 3@s raise|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: as cards sit  3 nt probably better but E knows he is getting a club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: greco was not happy with his pass "Hope ur not too good pard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: not sure how they play it - i think it's just a normal splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and worried about the enties maybe to W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: Having escaped a heart lead, declarer must still worry about losing 3 spades, a diamond, and a club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: but Greco knew that Hampson had the rounded suits|pg||

nt|sybarra: re Matt |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: Sher and Greco essentially had the same decision over the 1N rebid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: this layout is not great for declarer |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: does Brad lead the pedestrian ht |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|phil: Sher bidding the total tricks, but it looks pushy with a defensive 4333|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Looks like no way to avoid losing 2 @d and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: :?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer likely to play 6 @D,  hiding his low cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5 |pg||
nt|ritong: we all would be happy to be in 4@s i guess|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes i actually think its kind of random|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps a glimmer of light for Weinstein|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 41 was indeed 3 nt in the other room |pg||
mb|1C|nt|passell: lots of advantages|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry, accidentaly redealt the same board :)|pg||
nt|phil: it looked oddly familiar|pg||
mb|3H|nt|phil: it would be nice to get a little momentum for the next few boards going into the next set|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the advantages are more in the extra auction possibilities it creates|pg||
nt|scotty: Light opening likely to propel E-W to 3N.  If S leads a low heart, it makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: made even with the club lead |pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: and I was about to lay long odds Jackson would take more tricks in 1N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: correct|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so much in the lead placement|pg||
nt|migry: and then some|pg||
nt|bobh1: when lefty intervenes the transfers help them more with lead placement|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "catch all" 1 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: in competition the transfers are so much better than bidding naturally|pg||
nt|migry: but also in uncontested autions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Weinstein seems to have effectively controlled the bleeding, making a little reboudn here|pg||
nt|sybarra: helps |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: and why wouldnt he? |pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: well this doesnt look like much fun, does it? |pg||
nt|ritong: it looks ugly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|scotty: Some might have acted over 2@d with S - either double or 2@h is possible (i think 2@h is preferable between those choices)|pg||
nt|phil: but its quite likely Weinstein will open the E hand 1N and also get to 3N from the other side|pg||
nt|scotty: there is a pretty good case for leading a high heart here.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: some where n/s are going to find the spade shift |pg||
nt|phil: Josh will |pg||
pc|d9|nt|scotty: Or a high spade!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|scotty: High heart can gain against opponents Jx And if partner has JX, you have the entries to recover|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|phil: 4@s anyone? |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: mad scramble for 1 nt here |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|phil: I would assume A asks attitude and its logical to encourage with Jxxx (they play udca)|pg||
nt|scotty: Since East denied 4-card hearts, I see no advantage in the trick 2 low heart shift, as opposed to high heart|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: was wondering...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a trick (may 2) short of 1 nt so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but only 50's |pg||
nt|phil: Fred trying to steal his diamond trick before the spade tsunami|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of H! should suggest the spade |pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||

nt|phil: about now you want to turn your cards over and say, next|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Not only should there be enough information, it's his only option :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jackson can even play the 8 of @H next |pg||

nt|ritong: with a possible swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember folks they have 60 more bds tomorrow|pg||
mb|1N|nt|scotty: Most North's, had they started with 5-card @s, would have pitched one at some point - so the position is actually guessable - pitch spade, @dAK, spade to dummy, @d to N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not impossible to overcome this deficit but not easy either|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfj: North just pointed out the margin was never more than about 20 the entire match, untill the end, a well faught battle|pg||
