pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pasker: E cannot ruff losing @D and pick up trumps, so should be a @S @C and a trump or a @D for the defence to take it 1 down|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|pasker: N/S play a short @C giving S an awkard call being unable to raise @Cs initially and not having a full diamond stop|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1D = H ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i get the commentator's curse award of the year for sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1NT rebid is something like 18-20 - 1D was t/fer to hearts|pg||
nt|skollie: 1NT is 11-14|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@s?|pg||
nt|iyer7550: but both teams here are overbidding. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: at favourable some will stretch to 3@S with N's hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or even at green, as Zia did in the American Trials yesterday|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he went for 500 against 430, so only a small loss|pg||
nt|skollie: N will lead @dQ and 11 tricks will be made|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W  a negative double |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rado: desperate effort to promote trump trick for defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: towsend rock minimum for his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this can make double dummy on this lead but i fear iy wont make in practice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it will|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here unluckily it is wrong sided - 4nt not safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E will not enjoy discarding twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can safely discard clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if declarer plays 2 top diamonds it is over|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is that an abovious line|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when q@d drops does that deny the J!?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he discards clubs declarer's task is easy as little temptation to try club hook|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but there is restricted choice, plus some possibility that with diamonds that good he might have led one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he cashes his hearts East will be forced to make at leas 1 club discard and declarer will guess to play on diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possibe Victor but he has to play well if he is to makem this|pg||
nt|april7: a small swing for Germany  by making 3 @C losing only 1 trick in every suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H by E|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they should get there |pg||
nt|iyer7550: i was shocked to see a 3nt from west. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: only 8 trick but the defene must be carefull|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: 4@S by W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 4@H by E:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good lead 2@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how can south bid 2 dia, you know simon?|pg||
nt|copeyj: because they play 4 card suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when they have 4cM and weak NT they open 1M|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 1@D is often 5 for them|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so that promisses 3+ with an honour?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rmb1: Gerber ?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think it "promises" that|pg||
nt|copeyj: i mean he was non vul|pg||
pc|d7|nt|copeyj: and just trying to be awkward for the opps|pg||
nt|copeyj: but yes if you like :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok so just a 3 card raise- thx|pg||
nt|copeyj: he wants partner to lead @D if partner on lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a few values|pg||
nt|copeyj: this looks like down 1 in any case|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i meant with promising an honour:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: it just seems normal to run hearts then play 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there is a late discard coming in spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania credited with 10 tricks here on board 2 - but looks unlikely because they claimed at T1 and there were only 9 then|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so ns must keep playing dia |pg||
nt|rmb1: I suspect a pass is missing?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes and N-S reach 6@h -1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: diamond 7 asking for spade|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: no spade lead in the open room|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 6@h E-W here:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lasu: näyttäs kotipeliltä jos vetää hertta maskin|pg||
nt|copeyj: note the @DJ at T1 from Gold|pg||
nt|copeyj: tells his partner exactly what was going on in that suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: I suspect EW did not bid after 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: if LHO does have QJx of diamonds there is still the spade king onside possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see this failing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but then i dont see my own failings either:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes since WEst has at least 8 major cards playing diamonds looks natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can we call that a profesional play simon?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if Trine(Binderkrantz) had made the right lead:)|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|rado: kalispera|pg||
nt|mdgraham: crunch point - has to ruff high -  or are hearts 3-3 all along?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well club finesse not looking good now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|copeyj: i would imagine so|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yannis3012: kalispera rad|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: sorry,6 imps|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend-Gold defended extremely well in a match yesterday|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a pair that played sucessfully in bejing as well|pg||
nt|copeyj: most definitely|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@D |pg||
nt|copeyj: i hope he doesn't try to underlead his @DK to partner's (non existant) @D10|pg||
nt|copeyj: the thing is|pg||
nt|copeyj: he knows townsend has either K or Q of @H|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: so whichever it is|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can beat the contract by playing K@D and another @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be the queen of dia wasnt the right card earlier|pg||
nt|copeyj: although i suppose if townsend had dry Q@H left declarer could ruff high and then crash the @H honours|pg||
nt|copeyj: so maybe that is not true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he must be thinking all his posibilitys |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 imps is the difference here of making or -1- alot for a harmless looking 2 hearts|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rado: good defence and nice play by declarer too:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: now has to endplay east|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes this is fine as long as East has spade king|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he just has to knock out the diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: well townsedn has left himself ith no other realistic option|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: club plays seem premature|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jameslee 2: still -1 |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jeanhari: decl probably will go for the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i not sure if this was best line but he will survive |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|iyer7550: can chalk down a -1 or +50 for east west only if north spurns the finesse|pg||
nt|iyer7550: but who will give up a chance to make the contract. good try|pg||
mc|7|nt|odysseus69: ok ulessEast has 2 diamond winners and West has spade king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and still win an imp|pg||

nt|skollie: 1@h two way - 12-14 bal or strong with @h|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they claimed-? not possible he claimed 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: The only play is to play through @HAx, but declarer guessed wrong as to which defender had that holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: double is pass or convert|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@s waiting and EW will play in 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I now hear that an appeal brought back 2 VPs to both teams, so they only lost 3 each|pg||
nt|april7: an impossible 5 @D contract to make,because of no access to dummy for @H finesse, except EW leads @H sometime|pg||
nt|april7: 4 or 5 @D now!!!|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: 7 of Townsend's 10 points are in perfect place (K@H and A@C)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 1 spade denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only beating lead is @s|pg||
nt|jeanhari: cards well placed for EW, will probably make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|iyer7550: yes north will get thrown in all the time. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer considering if it is safe to play an heart|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but will be his most obvious play for the 7th trick|pg||
nt|iyer7550: hearts is the best suit to attack. |pg||
nt|iyer7550: will be a push board. |pg||
mc|8|nt|odysseus69: no pass with hearts (agree unlikely here) or bid 2s with spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far hard work and only a few specks of blood here and there |pg||
nt|april7: after 1@S opening 3@S could have also a good bid asking for a stop in @S, but S wanted to try for more with this hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead 10 of @H?????|pg||

nt|yannis3012: lucky 9 tricks here for n-s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the freaky EW hands 5@D-1 a very logic result|pg||
nt|christinas: 5 @d should be a good contract, but both minor suits break disastrously|pg||
nt|skollie: interesting - i expected jansma to overcall 1@h|pg||
nt|skollie: Ron has an interesting problem now|pg||
nt|skollie: bid spades, diamonds or double?|pg||
nt|christinas: I like the 2Nt bid, it takes away space and serves as a good preempt when he is not vulnerable and the opps are. But it could keep them out of the contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D i should think|pg||
nt|christinas: or perhaps even lead them to make it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i doubt 5@D can be made|pg||
nt|skollie: i would think they play 3@c as a good diamond raise here|pg||
nt|skollie: 3@d seems too little|pg||

nt|jaapfr: in 5@D i fear not able to trump @C enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: the reason 2@C is dangerous is that North can be presumed to have no major, and if he doesn't have diamond support (ok, he does here) then the one suit he must have is clubs  |pg||

nt|jeanhari: with a trump lead only 13 trick cause diamond king coming down after one ruff|pg||
nt|iyer7550: diamond finesse is a must. |pg||
mb|4N|nt|yannis3012: n-s can make 6@d biut its very difficult to bid it |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if S can push to 3nt |pg||
nt|iyer7550: not a % grand. but then nothing succeeds like success|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: not sure why the north in the open room had to just blast 3N over 2@D but it worked|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: Gold had an option to overcall 3nt directly over 2D...but perhaps he was worried abt missing a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: fave cards 4@s even 5 can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not really biddable|pg||

nt|lestergold: unless you play something old fashioned like 2@c shows clubs!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|jeanhari: West shoed something in diamonds by bidding 6@D over 5NT in the other oom|pg||

mb|6N|nt|yannis3012: at least they reached game|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: stayman|pg||

nt|copeyj: anyway they have arrived in the came contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Danger of lack of entries to North in 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|antoniz: komentujemy ¿yczeniowo, ale opozycja ozwia³a nadziejê|pg||
nt|jeanhari: strange choice, 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: will make after a non club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yannis3012: maybe the diamond fit was not guaranteed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but an agressive bid by south!|pg||
nt|iyer7550: unbelieveable choice. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: oh no... needs the club entry for the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so cant geiv up a diamond then|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: and danger of lack of aces in 6@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  the pas from Trine is dangerous here :):) |pg||
nt|iyer7550: 6nt is very doubtful contract. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so one room bidding and making 7, other down down in 6... most of the time it is the other way around :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andreasw:  y5@s is wrong bid to me unless 3nt was ask for ace's and 4@c was 2:D|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2-4*|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 1 imps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jeanhari: north mut find some good discards|pg||
nt|iyer7550: but east was really unreasonable to bid 6nt as a final contract. |pg||
nt|iyer7550: unless he picked on the wrong bidding card. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: norrth must throw 2 clubs, not easy|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only few imps at stake, players don't know that|pg||
nt|iyer7550: this is really going to be a test for north. and spectators are going to have a great chance to clap when north chooses to discard the right cards|pg||

nt|jaapfr: a real 4@H+2|pg||
nt|christinas: ok, NOW 2 more boards|pg||
nt|andreasw:  both win but still 6@s heng's on @h Q in place|pg||
nt|iyer7550: either ace or jack favourably placed teh contract can be made. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: well counted:)|pg||
nt|lesniak: o tyle dziwne ze zaczal kara od asa - n nie mogl miec singla karo|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas: this time the dutch bid more than the Danes - 4@h at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: jako 18 tasan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and ew have no makeble game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite 27 hcp|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk12: West did not bid her clubs at either table. Direct spade raise at one, 2@D here. Then you can forget about clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk12: By the way, the club suit died in the 60's|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol:)|pg||
nt|jillan:  I did not say that 6S is a good contract, only that is makes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Double by South now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6N makes 6@c not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a fan of 2N on the S hand, especially facing an unpassed hand -- 2N is a real slam-killer. bad enough when opps preempt us, we dont have to do it to ourselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|petere: 1@D 2+ (not 10-12 bal)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice hand, looks very difficlut to find the slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: its a two suited hand not a balanced hand of course|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 5@C bid very tempting great pass by W|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s look's like a winner|pg||
mb|d|nt|lasu: tilanne siis Norjan eduksi 21-19 epävirallisen laskennan mukaan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still down not to be avoided|pg||
nt|petere: 1@H nat or inv+ (any)|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Imaginative lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  as a spec said not an easy hand to lead from|pg||
nt|jillan:  a double would have been "cat licking it's jawls"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesniak: z dalszego przebiegu wyglada ze przegral|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pewnie znowu operator doklada³ karty po swojemu|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak taki kontrakt rozgrywaæ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: why not 4 spades?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: slam try |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4333 is nothing to be exited about|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: 3S is minors - I gree bout 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|petere: 1NT 13-15 bal|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: operator!!!!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: east will be pleased hearing 3@D, surely at least 5 with his club length|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petere: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|petere: 2@H done|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lead is 3rd and low from odd,|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: If East leads @D9 and North plays @D10 from dummy, East needs to duck|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Not sure why Sandra did not raise spades in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: must be heading for the doomed club slam|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wrong please change|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so a chance for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|lasu: kahta herttaa pelaa Antti toisessa huoneessa ja sai risti lähdön kurkon alta |pg||
nt|christinas: surprise - well done to stay out of game|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D in Gold & doulbe in East |pg||
nt|psridhar: XX=ace|pg||
nt|Walddk12: To me that is a clear 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Anyway, probably a flat board|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT not a good bid imo|pg||
nt|jeanhari: have to leave, running a bit late for me|pg||
nt|iyer7550: slam is out of question to bid. not with hand which has a 6 card minor suit. |pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: may play on hearts|pg||
nt|rado: no enough entries to check both red suits|pg||
nt|rado: now|pg||
nt|rado: enought|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 6C - not too lucky|pg||
nt|petere: 5 tricks for the defence, eh?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: bye all, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jameslee 2: redouble to show 1 control |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why 2@s should make?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: a very reasonable contract on a normal club break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 42-36 with 1 board to go|pg||
nt|lesniak: wygrywa impas pik ale jak rozgrywac - ciezko powiedziec, zapytajcie Jacka pszczoly ktory jest na trybunach i suie na tym najlepiej zna|pg||
nt|lesniak: tzn zna sie na tym jak niewielu innych...|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 4h Gold will sign off|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now bw?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes seems he gives up !|pg||
nt|psridhar: this hopefully shd end the auction let s see|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see what South decide |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but south has extras|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i would bid 6 with the south hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has to see that he needs SPd Q, H ace, dia ACE, and KQ of club from Gold, unlikely he will bid 4s with those|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think that north shows about that with his 3 bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South takes his time |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we have more than 20 min for 2 boards---|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: 43 minuts left|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thkx muriel|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: especially played by south|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo, ¿e nasi staneli w 2pikach|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with screens you have 8 min a board without 7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rado: routine ublocking 10 @H|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not down yet |pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wasnt down yet during the bidding either, but it will be|pg||
nt|lestergold: are u envisaging a pinning diamond finesse etc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt help|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my computer predicts nisht machen im afraid|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not envisioning anything except the person who sings at the end of things sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzers p[oint out that 6nt is an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Eamon well i think the singer will be Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tyhe end of this hand i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think mike said that at the start of the hand|pg||
nt|eamongall: Meanwhile over in London its 44-43 to one of the tennis players in the long game ... 8 hours now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or you did victor:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we noticed that a long time ago the 8 of dimaonds is a very big card|pg||

nt|petere: Board 17 +10 for being in 6@C|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rado: so @C suit used as entry only|pg||
nt|lestergold: ouch!|pg||
nt|christinas: every card is badly placed for declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dT|nt|andreasw:  ruff and a @d|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably in tended it as a 'chinese' finesse not expecting such a fine catch|pg||

nt|lasu: Vesa ja Jussi puolustaa hyvin kun eivät koske ristiin|pg||
nt|iyer7550: i am sure the problem of minor suit slams always keeps cropping up. anyway this is a problem for both teams. |pg||

nt|psridhar: both teams played very good bridge, England were a tad unlucky|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: & England still close|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no ruling in 12 so far, so result might change in favor of romania!|pg||
