nt|algraves: they have been playing together since late 1700 's it seems|pg||
nt|algraves: sort of a weak NT KS style with lots of little wrinkles|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Not that I think they will get close to slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: So all is well now; team names right, score correct and the tables are linked|pg||
nt|kit: 6@H can theoretically make with double club finesse, but in practice declarer would take diamond finesse and go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Big thanks to Jan who ran in here to fix it|pg||
nt|algraves: everyone well gruntled|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you need to undo, Bryan|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzff: I went the whole first segment without a misbid ... this segment is going to cost me 40 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries, you are doing just fine|pg||
nt|kit: well, after this aggressive 3@H call they just might get to slam|pg||
nt|algraves: EW make @H game or very luck 6 if they had to play it there|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|algraves: NS lose 5 tricks in @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: so this is normal bridge on this hand|pg||
nt|kit: Moss didn't try any kind of slam move -- seems pretty conservative.  Just the ace of diamonds and a 5-card heart suit could be enough.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: As Kit said, I don't think you will make slam|pg||
nt|algraves: Fred will find the hand interesting enough when the hearts so a tad sour|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Will be easier if Stansby continues spades -- which I think he will, hoping his partner has some decent hearts|pg||
pc|d6|nt|algraves: Well the opps probably have some reason to be bindding 4@S at unfavourable|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby did well to shift to a diamond.  Now declarer has some problems, as he can't get 2 spade ruffs and get back to his hand to draw trumps|pg||
nt|kit: But with clubs 3-2, he has several ways to mke.|pg||

nt|algraves: or pulling trump and casing clubs. depending|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|algraves: EW can make  a@S partscore |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|algraves: and NS have a little trouble going plus|pg||
nt|kit: but in closed room, West reopened with takeout double of 2@D and East chose to pass it -- unsuccessfully|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|algraves: although the club are " frozen " for the defense|pg||
nt|algraves: the 8  of @D a good spot|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for E-W to get to spades now|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|kit: Martel may run to the "safety" of 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: if Moss sits the double, that is.|pg||
nt|algraves: remember that 1NT rebid showed strong NT|pg||
nt|algraves: as they play weak NT openers at this vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Moss sits, it's probably only because 2@DX is not game if it makes. On this auction there is a good chance that EW have a spade fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: so while they think , I am told that Stansby and Martel play the weakie, all times except 3rd seat vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: that means if they open minor they are balanced only if 15 plus|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves: so if they are known to be 11-14 they are unbalanced|pg||

nt|Walddk2: As you may have heard or read, one match at the Europeans was replayed today after the teams (yesterday) managed to sit in the same direction for 20 boards without anyone noticing. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this has happened before; replays in bridge|pg||
nt|algraves: Well I think it is high time we had replays. I often would like a replay|pg||
nt|algraves: Maybe the ACBL could start selling them|pg||
nt|algraves: it is the American way after all|pg||
nt|algraves: he is right to be thinking but Martel will reason that Moss did not double one heart|pg||
nt|algraves: and no club lead|pg||

nt|kit: Stansby will transfer, then probably invite|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|algraves: he did have 5 reasonable trumps, 2 aces and a bidding partner|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|algraves: not enough , tough game|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has only 2 hearts, but with good 13 he will surely accept|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Martel with 5 controls will accept|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aces and kings are important in high suit contracts|pg||
nt|algraves: blind lead for Moss|pg||
pc|cK|nt|algraves: sorry fred|pg||
nt|kit: Defense can't set up both club and diamond trick in time to prevent discard on third round of spades|pg||
nt|kit: He will win ace of clubs (can't duck for fear of diamond shift) and play ace and a heart.  His spots turn out to be big enough to handle third round of clubs.|pg||
nt|algraves: so he has to duck this to stop promotion|pg||
nt|kit: no promotion -- he has 8 of hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|algraves: yes sorry didnt see the 8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: but if he ducks, he goes down on diamond shift|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|kit: now on diamond shift, the 5-2 spade split will defeat him.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: He will win, and now has to go after spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: hmm -- he does survive, as 9 of spades will be good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must have been the card that persuaded him to raise|pg||
nt|kit: declarer has both ace of hearts and ace of clubs for entries, so will not have to overtake the spade.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss is making sure he makes a play that will lead to defeat in some cases|pg||
nt|kit: so it goes:  Moss wins ace of spades and plays diamond.  King wins, spade to jack, heart to ace, q of spades ruffed and overruffed, club to ace, 9 of spades, heart|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: I think Moss should pass 1@S -- not so much to stop, but to let partner know he has 3-card spade support|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: If the double just showed a good hand, now Moss has to guess whether to get his club suit in or not|pg||
nt|kit: If it showed clubs, he could now double and his partner would have more options.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalty to USA|pg||
nt|algraves: The double showing values over weak NT stayman was first espoused by Maurice Harrison Grey , the Enlish internationalist from the 40,s and 50,s|pg||
nt|algraves: we bring you all the relevant information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1-1|pg||
nt|algraves: Meckwell have switched to Kits suggestion of double showing clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: this will not be pretty|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Double should say don't lead a spade, I believe|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: maybe not -- Martel thinks it is just penalty|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: But even with this miss, down 2 is likely if Marten finds diamond shift.|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer now may try to steal a spade, hoping clubs split|pg||
nt|kit: which would give him 2 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, 5 clubs (in his mind)|pg||
nt|algraves: Well the weak NT did its job here, creating a problem on a seemingly simple little partscore hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: Moss continued hearts -- I'm a little surprised he didn't try a spade.|pg||
nt|me argent: not so easy for martel|pg||
nt|kit: Martel wondering where his partner's double is coming from.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Definitely not so easy, but partner has to have something in diamonds.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|me argent: south @H9 |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Declarer saved a trick here|pg||
