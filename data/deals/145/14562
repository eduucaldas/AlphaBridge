nt|ahollan1: yes -- K&R looks at 10s -- but really doesn't like Queens|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|henryb:  I mean the team names. Both of you have them backward|pg||
nt|lml: well they go better with the 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in combination|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|lml: they don't want to get too high here but I don't imagine they will|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S = safe but 5@S = not safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could be "Baze"  @S raise, unspecified shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then 4@C=1@C  [3N would be some void]|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco has to guess the trump jack|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Weinstein flew @HA then dropped @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: thats the easy way!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more info at other table where opening lead was dummy's suit.   Here Fleisher's non-double of 3@H lulled declarer into playing low|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kit: testing .....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: he isn't going to take the ruffing finesse, but he wants to see if West will produce the ace|pg||
nt|stewball: is it unfashionable to play 1 @h forcing after dbl these days?|pg||
nt|kit: not easy for West to duck if he has it.|pg||
nt|me argent: not easy for west to have it|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|kit: Likely N-S will get to 4@S, down 1 on heart lead I think.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|kit: I'm surprised Moss bid only 1@H at favorable vul.  I would think at least 2@H, particularly with partner a passed hand.|pg||
nt|stewball: whats dbl?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: No clue, just saw hands pointing at it, sorry|pg||
nt|me argent: values with only 2@Hs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: many pairs play it shows 5 clubs and heart tolerance, but clearly not that|pg||
nt|flash: hand doesn't match up to Snapdragon (@Cs with @H tolerance), so let's try for an xfer to NT??|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: Hard not to bid 4@S now, may get doubled.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|me argent: values wiyh @Ss?|pg||
nt|flash: the dblton @C with West and East's 3 trump tricks remove last gasp here|pg||
nt|me argent: with|pg||
nt|mittmouse: the dbl may help him make this|pg||
nt|kit: if North leads 10 of clubs and Gitelman fails to cover, declarer can make|pg||
nt|reisig: Gotta run guys ...sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Thanks for stopping by Rich|pg||
nt|stewball: cu ritchie|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no i guess not|pg||
nt|reisig: ciao|pg||
nt|kit: but he should cover -- in fact, he should cover 9 of clubs in case declarer has 109 doubleton.|pg||
nt|kit: If he doesn't cover, declarer continues clubs, ruffed and overruffed, then AK of diamonds, and 4th club is good with West out of trumps.|pg||
nt|kit: Of course if Gitelman doesn't cover, will Weinstein take the finesse?  May depend on his table feel.|pg||
nt|gavin:  covering the @C is the only thing that Gitelman has to think about on this hand, he should be spending his time right now deciding|pg||
nt|ritong: he has now|pg||
nt|ritong: for a while|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|kit: Right -- but if Weinstein had thought more quickly, would be more difficult for Gitelman.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|lml: this should go down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: he cant get enough pitches for his hearts without the opposition ruffing|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is the killing lead and North will just play normally , pitch a heart and play spades. He has no reason not to expect 7 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is reluctant to duck first heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled 4@S|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|chorush: slightly conservative rebid and NS will miss the aggressive 4 heart contract that would make on a good day|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lml: they might make it on this layout depending on the lead|pg||
nt|algraves: meanwhile they can make at 5 @H from south , 4@S from north|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe JoAnna will learn if   a) 1N limits hand beyond 8-11 bal  b) 3@C agree @H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: South passed initially and would have opened 1@D with bal 11 so South is limited|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher can kill the whole thing if he leads the @DA if they do get to slam since the @Ck has to score|pg||
