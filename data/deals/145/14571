nt|Walddk2: Redouble = I want you to play 4@S    Pass = You can decide who should be declarer|pg||

nt|rodal f: Let's say 9.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s doesn't look a wise bid with two wide open suits and no fast tricks|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Or 6@D. A 50%er the last. @H a bit lower|pg||

mc|13|nt|mrdct: it seems that the trailing team in this segment has generally bid more conservatively - i wonder if that was a conscious strategy hoping the lead team woudl overbid to cover their ...|pg||

nt|mrdct: Ernie's @D suit not really good enough to stick his neck out vulnerable at the 4-level|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably a weak two to start with here from east|pg||
nt|rodal f: For me also alerted       as force|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: ok so a multi 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Am vaitingfor a push.|pg||
nt|mrdct: gill will delay his t/o double until east shows his suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: correct guesses needed in both @S and @D to make 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|serhat: this might be a pick up for Prescott team|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the @D suit will run|pg||
nt|mrdct: and once he learns it's @s he might just shut up|pg||
nt|mrdct: if anything 3@c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i would be passing|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 2@s bid implies a handful of @hs|pg||
nt|mrdct: i.e. a hand that is going to compete to at least 3@h opposite a weak 2 in @h but wants to play in 2@s opposite a weak w in @S|pg||
nt|mrdct: the concern for gill is that there will be plenty of hands gosney could hold where 3NT makes|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wonder what a delayed 2NT should mean after a multi 2@d|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Range ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Grand on. Butthe best is NT|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|serhat: now NS nows the H fit of opponents. Dyke might be 2h  to stay out|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Only Gill and I don't know what the 2D bid is...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT normaly use to tell minor. Even at this bid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably quite a good agreement - so what are the respnses?|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 3@c shows minimum - that is quite convenient for gill who can just pass it with his nice @c suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are the @D suit skiped from EW now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 17 imps up for grabs on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: brown will win 8 or lose 9|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: I'll find responses out after board|pg||
nt|mrdct: why on earth would gosney want to bid stayman?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Started at 2NT. S don't have for that bid.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: never seen this auction before|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they are playing system on after the 2NT bid then a transfer to @h woudl make some sense|pg||
