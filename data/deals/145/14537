mb|p|nt|chorush: Hello Jim|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: and Walter|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bbramley: i think this is hamman's toy showing 5@Ss and 3@Hs with a game force|pg||
nt|jlall: ok|pg||
nt|flash: the forcing NT has been known to cover a wide range?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1N was semi-forcing|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth chooses to make a tactical 1NT response -- he is protected by his partner being limited, so Rodwell can't be jumping to 3NT.|pg||

nt|jlall: i think bob will not open 1N here, too strong|pg||
nt|jlall: especially since they open a lot of 14s|pg||
nt|bbramley: no jacks, and a decent 5-card suit - but only 1 ace|pg||
nt|jlall: i know you hate upgrading bart :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we have just reconnected|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: hi everyone. I am Ira Chorush |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: welcome, Ira|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the surrogate mini-NT opener by roddy|pg||
nt|flash: nebulous 1@D - 2+ usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: i think their range does not include ave + 17s though|pg||
nt|flash: bloodied, but unbowed, we assume...|pg||
nt|chorush: I had the dubious pleasure of losing to the Nickell team in the round of 8|pg||
nt|chorush: but I will try. try again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: your operator for closed room is Serge Bondar|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has a pretty good hand, and is hearing a lot of bidding from the others|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is a one round force|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jillan:  Hi all, guess I have nothing better to do on a Swedish Midsummer's Eve then to watch rama. Hope this set produces more interesting hands....|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is ART 11-13 BAL|pg||
nt|chorush: i guess they will reach a meckwell special 3nt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck can now play 3NT from either side|pg||
pc|h7|nt|me argent: is 3nt inevitable?|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C looks a lot more likely -- Stansby can now project the stiff heart in Martel's hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|flash: welcome, Serge|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: he chooses to let eric stroke it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|flash: an extra card for the weak 2@D opener, but too much defense for 3@D in 1st chair...|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric said that pass of3@h is lead directing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlall: what would you lead here bart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N-S attitude leads vs NT, Smith Echo, udca|pg||
nt|jlall: @SQ seems pretty tempting but im a sucker for 3 card sequences|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Double would say doNOT lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X would say he wanted another leafd|pg||
nt|flash: Board 76 in as a push...   15-board segments|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: @SQ, in a photo with a heart - i have not problem with leading from ace-fourth|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer will test diamonds and then set up his hearts losing 3 tricks here|pg||
nt|jlall: for now he has to consider whether he will duck the lead or not, if he does hes vulnerable to a club shift but the defense has to find it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kit: Rodwell light even by their standards, and if spade lead the game will be down quickly|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room e/w allowed to play 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: However, Martel has no idea, so now there is a chance|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's a good start for declarer...  now just needs to pick @C|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|flash: Meckwell will play remainder of match; Hamman-Zia will come in for the last 2 segments|pg||
nt|chorush: Lew would have done well to dbl 2S as it happens. On this lead he can make with the club guess which he certain to get right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: n/s did not enter the auction|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flash: and Nickell will survive the 'violation' of the idea that a pre-empter doesn't take another call|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|bbramley: i know N/S play udca, so stansby @H plays may be smith|pg||
nt|algraves: South will take lots of trickshere|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|barnets: after east opened 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer in great shape now -- he will make even losing to queen of clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can even make now misguessing @C...  just duck 1 @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: overtrick IMP on 61|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chorush: For whatever reason, the Nickell team has a history of losing its first stanza of the day. Today, they can ill afford it|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|barnets: sorry 2@D pass 2@H passed oot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chorush: another 23 point 3nt coming home|pg||
nt|kit: so the match will be still closer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|nt|bbramley: delay of game|pg||
nt|barnets: Katz never bid his club suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: uess meck choose the correct side to play it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bbramley: that's better|pg||
nt|kit: A trump lead would have prevented the complete crossruff, and might well have been found -- but the AJ of spades would produce a second spade trick so would get up to 11 anyway|pg||
nt|bigtrain: g|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|algraves: on revious hand|pg||
nt|me argent: hamman not sure he has a minimum]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|algraves: 6@S is very poor contract because of the duplication in diaamond shape|pg||

nt|jlall: bob might just open 2@S here r/w|pg||
nt|bbramley: not a fan|pg||
nt|jlall: he is pretty conservative at this vul|pg||
nt|barnets: swing for fleisher|pg||
nt|kit: and making 3 more tricks than in open room, so 8 Imps for a non-vul game -- unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: 3@S for me, or just pass if my suit is weaker|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|flash: Chip Martel is our mystery guest, sitting North...|pg||
nt|algraves: ew make 3@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jlall: i like stansbys X|pg||
nt|bbramley: three hearts will deter some people|pg||
nt|jlall: at the 1 or 2 level you should overcall your 5 card suit, but at a higher level it's better to keep everything in play|pg||
nt|jlall: imo|pg||
nt|bbramley: i agree|pg||
nt|kit: apparently their 2@C doesn't have to be clubs, or maybe Martel is just trying to avoid a club lead|pg||
nt|chorush: well meck didn't know rodwell had as few tenaces as he had|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT forcing raise; 3@C minimum|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C shows a minimum|pg||
nt|flash: Stansby can re-ask about shortness|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: more than that -- he can ask about full shape|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jlall: by everything in play I mean, clubs, diamonds, or a penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|algraves: NS 3@H|pg||
nt|algraves: if they can find it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: Martel will bid 3NT, showing 5-3-3-2|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jlall: stansby is not showign a massive hand here, because martel showed values with his 3@D bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: clear 3@H call after partner shows values|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe diamonds shows 5 cards per system|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlall: with a bad hand he would have bid 2N, lebensohl|pg||
nt|flash: 5@D in the Open Room on 62, so 5 more IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lew wrote 5-3-3-2 to Eric|pg||
nt|flash: protecting the @CK a good idea here?|pg||
nt|kit: actually passing 3NT isn't so unreasonable, but I imagine he will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3N is a very good BAM result|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: quite possibly|pg||
nt|flash: appears that Martel-Stansby have added 2@C as a game force, not necessarily showing @Cs (red suit 2/1 requires 5-card length)|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder if 2@C needs alerted|pg||
nt|barnets: if it may be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|kit: I still think he might have simply been making a tactical call.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@h was alerted|pg||
nt|flash: 3@H showed shortness (in support of @Cs)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but I cannot read the notes|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C is balanced GF or clubs, 2@D would have shown 5 -- I get from valid source|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Serge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: tx , Jim|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now I read the shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric: given the 10@d in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 9@d is from 9xx, J9xx, or A9xx|pg||
nt|kit: With ace of hearts off and West having both spade honors, this has problems -- although can make by leading up to 10 of diamonds, getting 3 diamonds, 4 clubs, 1 heart, 1 spade|pg||
nt|flash: fair warning:  the play tends to be most 'thoughtful' - we hope you'll have the patience to stick with us|pg||
nt|barnets: On a heart lead dec could still make by playing @DA  and one towards the 10 here essentially he has the same guess|pg||
nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: But I think he will go down, going after spades instead|pg||
nt|barnets: whether west has !Q sing or !QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: @DQ |pg||
nt|barnets: if he reads the Q as a true card he is home|pg||
nt|flash: one more try...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 3N looks like a make|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein had a way to show a singleton spade but felt his hand was not good enough. If his spade Q had been elsewhere. he would have bid different;y|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby still looking for slam -- pretty optimistic|pg||
nt|algraves: North has just the right hand |pg||
nt|algraves: shouldnt be much to the play, ,of course declarer doesnt knonw that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlall: since you can shut hamman out|pg||
nt|bbramley: lucky make when spades go 7-2 instead of 6-3, AND east has all of the other relevant high cards|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: if spades are 7-2, then hamman probably has nothing else|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: E-W std carding and leads, obvious shift|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: not clear -- he doesn't know yet he has 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: now he will make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but he needs an entry to the @D...  thus needs J or Jx in @C|pg||
nt|barnets: he knows east has the @D8|pg||
nt|kit: so he may think the third diamond trick might not be enough|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: if Meckstroth is able to duck quickly declarer would have a problem, but ducking is far from obvious|pg||
nt|barnets: why problem? @D8 must be with east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck is thinking...|pg||
nt|barnets: so he can play the 7|pg||
nt|kit: true|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and why a problem at all...  any @D play works|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bbramley: the lead (when north has the 9) and east's failure to raise both suggest the 7-2 split|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and smith echo, high from either side says likes the suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: Meckwell are playing 4@D, after they got Xd in 3NT|pg||
nt|jlall: hi mildred|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi, everyone :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if i were playing all four positions the contract would be 5@D:  3@S-P-4@S-DBL-P-5@D|pg||
nt|jlall: full disclosure... all commentators here are texan so bob hamman is our god ;)|pg||
nt|bbramley: hi mildred|pg||
nt|bbramley: as well as my boss|pg||
nt|jlall: wow bart, if it went 3S X 4S X p i would pass and lead my stiff heart and expect to get a huge number|pg||
nt|jlall: no wonder you bid so much, you dont X yourself :P|pg||
nt|jlall: it was a good double by steve in the other room, i wonder if he did it to get them to run|pg||
nt|bbramley: this time you would, but next time south will have VOID-KQxxx-KQxx-Axxx and west will be void in diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: weinstein is very successful/famous in the poker world, so whenever he Xs a 3N and they run and it's cold I think he played poker|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's a good ploy to double 3NT when you have no idea if they can make it|pg||
nt|bbramley: if they sit you hope to beat it, and if they run to 4 of a minor you'll be happy regardless|pg||
nt|jlall: yes i agree, it ups the stakes tremendously for them and only a little bit for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hamman still thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm a little surprised that meck ran - he plays a little poker himself|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman knows its right to shift since he has no entry to his suit, unfortunately it looks like there is no promising shift|pg||
nt|jlall: sometimes in this situation its right to just set up your suit as a bluff like you have an entry, but here it is futile|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - every shift helps declarer - even a diamond creates an extra entry in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: the double will slow them up for sure.  But without the double, I think Martel would have liked his hand considering that he had already shown 5-3-3-2 minimum|pg||
nt|flash: @H lead in the Open Room|pg||
nt|kit: so one more IMP will be coming to Nickell|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: still surprising line of play, as he doesn't know he will have an entry to the diamond (after heart shift)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mildredb: need to do that quicker ;)|pg||
nt|barnets: he could play the 7 even had east held the Q the suit was sure for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: the J I meant|pg||
nt|kit: there is going to be a BIG swing on this hand, and Nickell-Katz are having a mixup and are in a grand slam!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck saying sorry... for a long pause|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have a disaster on this board in open rooom bidding 7@S!!|pg||
nt|barnets: undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: amzingly|pg||
nt|barnets: t|pg||
nt|barnets: north responded 2@D to 1@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and after that they were on an unstoppable train|pg||
nt|barnets: but west did not x 7@S|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure why|pg||
nt|kit: What happened I believe is that South bid 3@h splinter, and North thought it was natural|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: levin said i thought they may run to 7N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|kit: West didn't double 7@S was afraid of run to 7NT|pg||
nt|barnets: weinstein had already x 7@H|pg||
nt|barnets: so he might have taken a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Martel doesn't know that he is home now, but will soon find out -- what can he do but play a club?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bbramley: he couldn't afford to guard against KJx with east - no reentry|pg||
nt|flash: for newcomers to BBO Vugraph, you can see the Open Room auction by moving your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|flash: many pairs these days don't have a weak 2@D call available; that might have led to the swing on 62|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|bbramley: this will be 7 imps to fleisher:  400 vs 130|pg||
nt|jlall: he can play ace of clubs club to the 9 and if it's ducked he can run his diamonds and exit a club|pg||
nt|algraves: so he needs to manage the Spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chorush: so this will be one imp back to Nickell|pg||

nt|jtr: Best lead too  If @ds are bad they can tap declarer out|pg||
nt|algraves: if you came from a pay your rent as a young player background at the old time rubber clubs you didnt go passive much because your weak partners always mashed it up.|pg||
nt|algraves: attacking defenses are much easier and quicker ( so more hands to make more money )|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, we call them defences:)|pg||
nt|algraves: A lot of the great modern partnerships start passive a bit more|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry. missed that class playing bridge|pg||
nt|me argent: the theory being the longer the hand lasted the more likely the defence got mashed up|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia plays a lot of very high stake rubber so is comfortable with that|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: tnx|pg||
nt|algraves: J then K|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: looks pretty close to a slam here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: I was wondering|pg||
nt|algraves: ergo no Q because of all the possiblities|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: also, Ira, some players won't show the singleton if it's a King or Queen - those potentially combine too powerfully with honors in the opposite hand|pg||
nt|flash: my kind of weak 2!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: not just the 3 imps- psychological hit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jlall: if they bid it, they can make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: interesting situation for Levin - even with the 4-card @S suit, he doesn't want to let West in cheaply|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H i'd imagine|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not 1@D|pg||
nt|chorush: Think 4H from Rodwell|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@C is drury|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|flash: Stansby's hand too strong to open 2@D (Flannery)|pg||
nt|flash: and Martel's hand-type not suitable for a 1@S response (which, in any case, would tend to show 5)|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S some sort of raise of @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jlall: they can double hook diamonds pitching a heart, and then ruff a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one line|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: 3@H is smolen, showing 5@S and 4@H - it's another way to transfer the declarership to the notrump hand|pg||
nt|flash: looks like a McCabe situation - any suit call other than a raise would have been a lead-director and showed @H support|pg||
nt|flash: so the raise implies that leading the pre-empted suit is safe|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though a ruffing finesse in @Ds will see declarer home on this one?|pg||
nt|kit: so they will reach routine 4@H game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jlall: if 4@D shows shape, then zia will be turned off by short clubs with partner|pg||
nt|flash: but it's not the most comfortable contract we've seen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: if 4@D is just a cue, zia will still like his hand|pg||
nt|flash: and here i was giving Weinstein the 'sexy lead of the event' award...|pg||
nt|kit: not so clear to me it can make -- control problems|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry there were 4 9's i clicked on wrong one|pg||
nt|flash: oh to be playing baccarat...|pg||
nt|chorush: He needs the ruffing finnesse in diamonds and something more; he has 3 uncovered spot cards in his hand and th diamonds will take care of only 2. Still I think he can make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: lead is standard and ambiguos|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer has to fight to ruff the third heart in dummy, and be happy to be overruffed -- but the diamond lead and threatenedoverruff kills that plan|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how it makes -- what are his 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they don't differeniate number of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: or might take a club finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: I'm sure Stansby could have probed for a 4-4 spade fit if he had wanted, but he judged that 5-3 heart fit would play just as well or better.|pg||
nt|algraves: apparently it is 5@S and 3@H|pg||
nt|algraves: says a kibitzer|pg||
nt|algraves: hasnt caught on yet|pg||
nt|algraves: but you never know|pg||
nt|algraves: strong NT , flannery and the Hamman 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bob alerted to Lew 3@c as 5-3 @s and @h|pg||
nt|algraves: and a game force, it certainly handles a problem hand nicely|pg||
nt|passell: interesting hand with normal Q of dia lead|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|chorush: was a heart led? I had tought so|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@H just means he doesn't have the worst hand (some slam interest)|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman had nothing extra for his 1 slam try so he quit|pg||
nt|bbramley: this is the right spot - slam is mediocre, even though you can make it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jlall: yeah definitely|pg||
nt|flash: couldn't afford the 2nd round of trumps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|algraves: yes the @D lead threatens 4 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|flash: probably had to play on @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: declarer ca takeruffing finesse in diamonds, but then Levin has long trump left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Ralph is asking about signals on trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: "we play H-L if we want to ruff" said Bobby|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|algraves: 1 D, 1C and 2H|pg||
nt|passell: north has to fly with the heart ace for any chance|pg||
nt|algraves: say more Mike|pg||
nt|passell: with the Q of dia lead   now it looks pretty hopeless on defense|pg||
nt|algraves: yes diamnd lead, heart ace and a diamond while club ace still with defense|pg||
nt|passell: even if forced to play spades he has no real losing ooption|pg||
nt|algraves: and trump Q as entry to diamond trick|pg||
nt|algraves: but here he will make almost regardless|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|algraves: as mike says if it gets really deperate he can take 3 spade tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Serge|pg||
nt|kit: maybe this can work, if he doesn't ruff the queen of diamonds but pitches on it|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|passell: now zia can cash heart and play high clubs|pg||
nt|passell: good play by Martel in case his partner has the K of hearts instead of Q|pg||
nt|algraves: he is thinking about 4-1 breaks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia is holding @cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jlall: a 23 HCP game here that doesn't look cold at all|pg||
nt|flash: the first stitch in the major laceration?|pg||
nt|algraves: so for all you out there looking for avant garde bids you now have the Hamman 2@S bid for your 5-3 major game force over 1@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chorush: I believe the hand could be made on a double dummy basis, at least|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell gets his lead-direcctor in|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jlall: i guess you can pitch your diamond loser on the spade to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Martel doesn't want to pass an risk getting frozen, but 1@S on 4-card suit no bargain|pg||
nt|barnets: i like it good suit good hand|pg||
nt|flash: N-S use strong NT in this position, hence the 1@D opener|pg||
nt|algraves: Martel chooses his long suit rather than light takeout double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@c alerted as mixed raise|pg||
nt|algraves: and hits his partner nicely thank you very much|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bbramley: but will make handily - @S overcall indicates @SA with north|pg||
nt|flash: 63 and 64 in as pushes|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: bidding it should be easy after a 1@C opener and a support double|pg||
nt|passell: I like take out dbl  how about you ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: vul 3rd seat Martel-Stansby play strong notrumps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bigtrain: they've mellowed as they've aged|pg||
nt|flash: Kaplan (who moved to it) called it Chicken K-S|pg||
nt|chorush: declarer has a number of play options here. whichever he chooses works|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will win 2nd round of hearts and probably go after spades, successfully|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 10 is top from 10xx, with this dummy shows the J, said Jeff|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H10 shows the J from 4+ card suits...  otherwise it's standard|pg||
nt|algraves: well me too|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|jlall: so to make declarer will pop ace, pull trumps ending in hand, and lead a spade up|pg||
nt|jlall: eventually pitching their @D on the @SK, and then leading a club up|pg||
nt|bbramley: better win the ace, not because of the impending ruff but for fear of a diamond shift|pg||
nt|flash: too many cards off-side here?|pg||
nt|flash: even with the @HT making an early appearance|pg||
nt|flash: and the 1@D opener is usually 2+|pg||
nt|kit: this will get them to reasonable 4@H, not likely to make on lie of cards|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in open room|pg||
nt|barnets: @CA led|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell has big opening lead problem|pg||
nt|passell: we Canadians like to bid em up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer can go after hearts, but still only 2 hearts, 4 diamonds, 2 spades it appears|pg||
nt|algraves: but I guess but so much is style isnt it .|pg||
nt|algraves: so many way to skin the cat|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|kit: Now declarer can make -- 10 of spades dropping means he has 5 hearts, 3 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: levin shifted to a spade won by the K|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec made|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C4 is a standard signal since the A is from the AK in theory|pg||
nt|barnets: if east wins @SK and plays @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not good enough...  19 tricks can always be made from here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 10|pg||
nt|kit: wouldn't matter -- declarer unblocks spades, king of hearts, heart to ace, spades|pg||
nt|barnets: dec makes by cashing @SJ and @HK@Ha|pg||
nt|kit: But if East puts in spade spot, interesting things can happen|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see how Meckstroth could find that play, but he is quite imaginative so you never know|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|passell: see you later  gotta miss the rest of this great match   look for more Zia action|pg||
pc|h8|nt|flash: Nickell finds the needed passive continuation |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|chorush: this is a rare occsion when Nickell can see enough entries in his own hand to establish his weak suit|pg||
nt|flash: the defense will have 5 tricks without the long @D?|pg||
nt|chorush: no his entries will establish the fifth diamond while he still has one entry left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Steve call Nickell a "persistent bugger" for  the 2nd diamond lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: declarer can still go down now -- he may choose to finesse West for 10 of spades|pg||
nt|barnets: yes I am not sure why the unblock|pg||
nt|barnets: did not seem necessary|pg||
nt|kit: wasn't unblock -- he led jack of spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: another fineese coming up after cashing the hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry |pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: if Meckstroth comes back a heart the spade finesse won't be necessary, as Rodwell would be squeezed|pg||
nt|kit: I expected him to run the 8 of spades -- not clear that 1 spade trick will be enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|algraves: @s not going anywhere of course|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: but Meckstroth did well to come back diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: Weinstein willhave to hope that Nickell is missing one of those entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Steve: sorry I need to think|pg||
nt|kit: Now two top hearts probably, and then moment of truth|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chorush: Walter didn't rods heart J tend to imply clubs?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jlall: looks like this happened at the other table too|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jlall: undo?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chorush: Nickell should return the diamond 10 to show something in spades|pg||
nt|kit: And it looks to me like he will go wrong|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: very intersting the differnce caused by west not playing a spade at trick 2 here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|flash: Katz' @Cs are needed!!!|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO Nick should have returned the diamond 10, now he should diiscard it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: clearly percentage to finesse|pg||
mc|10|nt|chorush: I pretty sure Katz canwork out Nick's hand though|pg||
nt|flash: so the long @D doesn't come into play, after all...   |pg||
nt|chorush: no, it could have if Nick kept leading them|pg||
nt|flash: all roads lead to 8 tricks from here?|pg||
nt|chorush: not if Katz pitches a club|pg||
nt|chorush: that 543 is too powerful|pg||
nt|barnets: h survives|pg||
nt|kit: I'm amazed he got that right|pg||
nt|barnets: 53 imps now with 40 boards to play|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfk: especially since @ds are 5-1|pg||

nt|gavin:  on a non trump lead 7@S just needs u to be able to cash akq of clubs and ak of diamonds, then u can make on a high cross ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: although in thoery 13 tops|pg||

nt|algraves: note that Stansby did not overbid his 5 card support because he was balanced with no outside cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|gavin:  weinstein did very well not to bid more than 2@S here, left south with a free bid of 3@D which didnt show significant playing strength, just the willingness to compete|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@D alerted as trans, possibly 5@s nad 4@h|pg||
nt|barnets: Here east will play contract|pg||
nt|barnets: so wont be a singleton lead|pg||
nt|kit: Or they might get to clubs instead of hearts, in which case it is just on the club guess|pg||
nt|kit: or they just might stop in game|pg||

nt|mittmouse: nice result for nickell in the closed room|pg||
nt|flash: Fleisher bid 4@H where Katz bid 3|pg||
nt|flash: the 1@H rebid shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|jlall: martel doesnt know abotu the club fit|pg||
nt|flash: for newcomers to BBO Vugraph, you can see the Open Room auction by moving your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen|pg||
nt|flash: (for those watching on BBO TV, you'll need to click on Other Table Result|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Levin's XX shows 3-card @S support|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will like his hand a lot now -- I think they will bid slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C promises 5+@H and is a natural sound slam try|pg||
nt|barnets: there is some chsnce that the x of 3@D may help dec guess clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: then yes...  although he may have been trying to clarify the original holding since he could have still lead the 10 from 10xx|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jlall: so he doesn't really want to go past 3N|pg||
nt|mittmouse: another example of how active competition can make it easier to unearth your great fit|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein is likely to bid 5S if, in their methods that asks for 6 with heeart control|pg||
nt|barnets: @D length with north|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why double of 3@D will make any significant difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: but stansby might have bid again - his hand doesn't look real notrumpy|pg||
nt|jlall: true but he has long hearts|pg||
nt|bbramley: same auction both rooms - some hands are just too tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Martel is smiling|pg||
nt|chorush: or he might assume heart shortness and just bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Very decent grand slam here, but the bad diamond split may derail it|pg||
nt|chorush: 7 spades is a reasonable spot here but anyone who getsthere will regret it unless theysee the hand layout|pg||
nt|flash: most play 1@S as NAT, F1??   (and reserve 2@S for 4th suit forcing??)|pg||
nt|kit: depends on lead -- without a trump lead, can make if guess which minor cashes|pg||
nt|flash: another overtrick IMP on 95; 10-0 segment score|pg||
nt|kit: If they stop in small slam and get trump lead, declarer still could have problems|pg||
nt|kit: If he tries cashing AK of diamonds, certainly reasonable, they can ruff in and lead another trump, and he will be a trick short|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|chorush: in some partnerships 5S is a command, in others it is a suggestion|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein should be able to picture his partner's exact hand if he trusts the enemy bidding|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S RKC for hearts Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: hi alan all|pg||
nt|algraves: hey Scotland has sent its representative|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: wd by Levin- Weinstein. Hamman-Zia had essentially the same auction|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised Meckstroth didn't try 5NT pick a slam (assuming that's what it would mean)|pg||
nt|algraves: so we will probably see a some best laid plans go aawry|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mittmouse: y a great push|pg||
nt|barnets: aft  agley you mean|pg||
nt|algraves: so an easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: The 5@S call presumably needs a heart control, since if Weinstein had a heart control he could have Q-bid 5@H instead|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, 5H would ask for a better trump holding|pg||
nt|flash: RKCB; 0 or 3 (must be 3)|pg||
nt|kit: Now can't go down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: do they pplay third in partners suit|pg||
nt|barnets: ?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chorush: this sets up a potential swing because theother table could get to 7 spades and if they do, they could make it or go set|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|nt|jlall: if zia bids 3N, I think bob will pull with 7-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: just guess trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: and ruff a diamond in dummy |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia: we make pick some [on this board] but as much as needed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|flash: 3@D is an xfer|pg||
nt|barnets: has to take first round @H fnesse |pg||
nt|barnets: tough|pg||
nt|algraves: so Hamman has no good reason not to  guess the hand and play south for shortness and the major big cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bob ask to close screen, and asking about the leads|pg||
nt|barnets: and still may lose to the @HQ|pg||
nt|algraves: so it a question of timing|pg||
nt|barnets: as there is no quick entry off dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: to draw the last trump|pg||
nt|algraves: they are threatening the promotion with the Spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Screen is down down again|pg||
nt|algraves: a better analyst than me just kibitzed that it cannot make , at least not straightforwardly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: More Q-s from Bob to Lew|pg||
nt|barnets: well it is not clear how he can ruff @D and get back to hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: OK|pg||
nt|algraves: exactly|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: spade lead more likely to hit partner's 5-bagger than a club lead, but it still won't beat the contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Ralph asking his screenmate Bobby - 4th best?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|jlall: martel might lead a club not really to get ruffs, but because he is so short there and think sthats his best chance to set up tricks|pg||
nt|jlall: really he just wants to get tricks ASAP|pg||
nt|gavin:  martel can be confident that hamman has 7@H, likely 3@C, so he can see the potential for diamond tricks to dissappear|pg||
nt|jlall: hes not even thinking of a tap since hamman is marked with 7 hearts|pg||

nt|bbramley: good lead|pg||
nt|kit: This will go down 2 or 3, and more imps to Fleisher|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Not clear why Rodwell take preference to 2@H -- Meckstroth could be 5-5|pg||
nt|chorush: this appears to be down 1 and fortunate to be that few|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: super wish trick|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby may have to dump king of diamonds uner the ace to avoid an end-play, depending on how the play goes|pg||
nt|barnets: if n def lead clubs then dec can make |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ONLY spade return to defeat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip is smilling|pg||
nt|barnets: two rounds will give him transportation|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mildredb: no need to ruff, his @H winners are natural|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bbramley: 12 more imps for fleisher|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: well, that solves the defensive problem|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room n/s did not take a bid West opened 3@H raised to 4|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s passed throughout|pg||
nt|barnets: here east kind of helped ns into the auction|pg||
nt|barnets: with his opener|pg||
nt|algraves: yes the short suit lead was the killer, Stansby taking a while to get it right. double checking and all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: He was touch the red cards for a while...|pg||
nt|algraves: he is thinking , if spades indeed 5-2 then I need hearts 2-2 or south with singleton Q|pg||
nt|algraves: as unlikely as that may seem|pg||
nt|barnets: also could get home with HJX clubs in south|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jlall: after effectively the same auction, rodwell tried a club at the other table|pg||
nt|bbramley: benito might approve, but martel wins the swing|pg||
nt|gavin:  thats atleast the 2nd board today that fleisher has won a board on opening lead|pg||
nt|algraves: Stansby doubled with 5233 good hand and Martel passed cause , whynot?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: could set up the 10|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: because meck could have 3@S or 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: he may be getting this right|pg||
nt|barnets: setting up his own club trnsportation|pg||
nt|barnets: if south leads a high spade he can ruff later with the @HK|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is a good alternative. he will ruff spade with King finesse heart and try to drop J of clubs by ruffing then over to dummy to pitch his ten of dimonads|pg||
nt|barnets: ruff a @D|pg||
nt|barnets: ruff  a club|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry that does not work|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy has only two trumps left|pg||
nt|barnets: and he will lose a trump|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: can almost bring it home on a diamond back... winning the King, swing the T@H and ruff a @d'|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: however GIB still says -1|pg||
nt|algraves: well close only counts in horseshoes|pg||
nt|algraves: not in 4@H doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We just went thru the halftime clock beep!|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure why bob did not pl the @C9 in case south had AJ8|pg||
nt|algraves: Hamman has two  chances neither of which will work. 1, Stansby is down to AJ in clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: They set 130mins for 15 boards|pg||
nt|barnets: then he could set up the 10 later|pg||
nt|algraves: or he plays hearts 2-2 or south with singleton Q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: But clock could not handle the 3 digits, so it resets halfway thru|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|algraves: a commuter train hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Yucky hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|gavin:  3@H transfer to 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: that is a good treatment that says I want to play 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: A lot of sense in that|pg||
nt|jtr: Partner might have Qx(x)|pg||
nt|algraves: yes even more one level lower which is how some Poles play it |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jtr: Hamman has no fear|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S is very close without a trump lead|pg||
nt|gavin:  hamman fears that the 3@H bid is based around a long running @C suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and that he is getting stolen from|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: isnt the @sA lead obvious vs 4@s here?|pg||
nt|algraves: and will make if declarer can guess stiff A of spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: Now what is Zia doing?|pg||
nt|algraves: well it is obvious when you can see all the hands|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jtr: Trying to play in  @cs again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  he wont need to guess the spade if they dont lead a trump he will just ruff enough stuff in his hand|pg||
nt|algraves: not so obvious when you can see  only 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@c let them in|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he can elope with 4 small ruffs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: 4@s would have left things to partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|algraves: all academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: quite the auction|pg||
nt|me argent: hamman shows doubt|pg||

nt|me argent: that they can make 6@Ds|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves: notice how the ridiculous 6@C contract has not prevented NS from still staying at the table|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure they can make 3@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: EW badly misjudged this hand with a lot of action|pg||
pc|sA|nt|me argent: hamman is a great believer in NEXT|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think fleisher thought his partner had a spade void for all of his opponents bidding|pg||
nt|gavin:  put the Ace of spades elsewhere , give partner 0-4-4-5 and u have a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|algraves: yes it is dangerous to trusst opps rather than partner|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mildredb: aw, ok, :)|pg||
nt|chorush: he woul dhave said nice lead to me also|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman also led a small @C, but Fleisher played on @Hs, rather than @Ss|pg||
nt|kit: reasonable 3@C opening here if Nickell wants|pg||
nt|barnets: the world champions are now in very deep trouble 62 down|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is a one round force|pg||
nt|barnets: nickel picked up 14 imps|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a good position to be 200 plus on that board as you can see it making on different defense|pg||
nt|barnets: when weinstein was down 3 in 4@H that zia made|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: nick passed after a long pause|pg||
nt|chorush: Nickell would almost always have 7 for the 3 level here|pg||
nt|flash: that would be slightly out of character?|pg||
nt|kit: if Martel gets his spades in there, things get exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: levin-weinstein caught speeding in other room|pg||
nt|jlall: NS cannot make 3N if zia does not save|pg||
nt|gavin:  hard to believe he will save |pg||
nt|jlall: weinstein did|pg||
nt|gavin:  he wants a spade lead has 3 little hearts (knows their @H finesse is offside)|pg||
nt|gavin:  totally different auction|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, the 4@S bid in the other room is a little rich|pg||
nt|gavin:  weinstein furthered the preempt in a strong club auction|pg||
nt|flash: big position with minimal values and no real tolerance?   |pg||
nt|kit: but bigger position to leave that suit on the shelf|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: So Rodwell got the 1NT in at this table, but he won't be happy with it -- this could go down a lot|pg||
nt|flash: Martel's values quite soft to X?   but they still have chances for 400|pg||
nt|kit: Martel not close to a double IMO|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will likely shoot out game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chorush: 4 spades going to make them guess is my guess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|flash: shudder|pg||
nt|kit: much safer to come in now?|pg||
nt|flash: it's sooooo much safer to do it immediately than to pre-balance|pg||
nt|kit: And if they play there, Meckstroth better put the big ace of trumps on the table|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised Rodwell didn't double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: UD signals|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  this is not a sacrifice auction , specially when u know best case is -300|pg||
nt|jlall: lol ok|pg||
nt|bbramley: newspaper lead! 4th from longest and strongest...|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like 15 back to Nickell|pg||
nt|kit: Martel sure will, however, if he gets a chance|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: anywy, N-S get to the normal and doomed 4@S game anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It took Martel a long time, before his pass|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is a downside to Xing 1NT overcalls...  it allows the opponents to find 2m fits that are usually unreachable|pg||
nt|kit: Well, Stansby beat him to it|pg||
nt|chorush: doesnt their double say i want to bid?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: not on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: very good point Walter, a point which many don't realize|pg||
nt|kit: Walter?|pg||
nt|lesniak: thay dont pla3-5?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bbramley: when hamman gets in with @HQ he'll have little choice but to lay down @SA|pg||
nt|chorush: it does if they think they are in a force but this was only 1 rd force|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it feels like it may be but usually those type Xs are made by the partner with the long trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|flash: the issue under discussion is a beastie called PDI - Pass-Double Inversion|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass is NF by roddy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|flash: through 6 boards, Diamond has added 10 IMPs to the lead; now 81|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|flash: which switches the traditional meanings of the two calls|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to be in an established GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it doesn't apply here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it also doesn't apply in auctions where they just bid game|pg||
nt|chorush: based on the result from the other room this will be a pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|flash: defense can get 500 here, as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mildredb: moment of truth|pg||
nt|gavin:  hamman really has no choice here|pg||
nt|gavin:  no way to beat this hand other than @S 7-2-2-2 around the table|pg||
nt|bbramley: zia played @H7, positive smith echo - but should be irrelevant|pg||
nt|jlall: the @D3 might be whats confusing bob|pg||
nt|bbramley: still, why is hamman taking so long...|pg||
nt|jlall: if that was the smith then it looks negative|pg||
nt|gavin:  KQx AKJ9xx Kx xx ?|pg||
nt|bbramley: one of many reasons i hate smith echo|pg||
nt|gavin:  could he have that hand|pg||
nt|jlall: then you can shift after the @SA|pg||
nt|gavin:  still needs to cash the spade right ?|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya|pg||
nt|barnets: hello marcin|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfc: "tricky-nicky" said bobby on 10@c|pg||
nt|kit: how 500?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have very few forcing pass situations that aren't hands that a GF was established below game|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if that makes sense|pg||
nt|chorush: makes perfect sense|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i reread it and it started to sound like gibberish  :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I played in a cuebid in my match against them becasue I was trying to create a forcing situation for us|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has no way to get to dummy without compressing trump tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: declarer now inferentially knows the shape -- South has overcalled hearts, raised spades, and shown up with 5 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff intertain the @h8 lead|pg||
nt|kit: so heart to king (if South ducks) looks pretty reasonable, planning on ruffing spade and then playing good clubs letting North ruff|pg||

nt|gavin:  in the unlikely event that e-w leads a @H or trump , then they can make 4@C by drawing trumps cashing the hearts and leading a spade up, NS will be unable to negotiate their 2nd spade trick|pg||

nt|algraves: Zia has borrowed a point from the vulenerability god|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jlall: martel/stansby play weak NT|pg||
nt|jlall: hence 1@D|pg||
nt|gavin:  meckwell's biggest weakness is high level decisions, putting it to them isnt a bad idea|pg||
nt|flash: Stansby treating as too big for a 1NT overcall?|pg||
nt|barnets: but west could have beaten it with the @H10 lead|pg||
nt|kit: I open room 4@S played from South side so could have been defeated with heart lead|pg||
nt|flash: through board 97 in the other semi-final; Weinstein has rallied a bit - now down 64|pg||
nt|barnets: east has 5 wasted points for play in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: well it was a bad idea that time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: presumably NS have a way to raise diamonds and have partner pass wtiha  strong NT|pg||
nt|bbramley: north has 17, but no aces is a BIG defect for 3NT|pg||
nt|flash: remember that 1@D doesn't necessarily promise length|pg||
nt|kit: guess I'm wrong -- can take quick club pitch|pg||
nt|barnets: actually dec has a club pitch|pg||
nt|barnets: on the third diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Kamil overcalled 2@H with the East hand|pg||
nt|barnets: so cn rise @HA |pg||
nt|barnets: and take his pitch|pg||
nt|chorush: very good non 1 spades bid by Stansby. A lot of players feel compelled to do something on this vulnerability|pg||
nt|kit: N-S competed a bit too high in other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this should promise 4@S without extras|pg||
nt|algraves: so the other room is 3 boards behind|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chorush: if the opponents were NV, Katz might have taken some action to protect his sides interests against potential thieves|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1NT is 12-14 in this position|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Serge|pg||
nt|passell: difference in style  Kamil chose 2hearts at fav vul with the east hand|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell's failure to overcall may cost him -- now they have to defeat 1NT which they might not do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Defense 4th best and Smith echo|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i guess kamil earned the imps with his enterprising 2h bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i guess he couldn't make himself pass 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jlall: yeah north knows his partner has at most one ace so his hand is pretty bad|pg||
nt|kit: Martel will try again for a major I imagine|pg||

pc|dT|nt|flash: trump lead to keep the defense in the game?|pg||
nt|kit: trump lead is effective here, and quite reasonable|pg||
nt|bigtrain: loos like a trump might beat this|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: lead are standard  here]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to get 2 trumps in and then tap dummy before the long @H sets up|pg||
nt|kit: when no likely side source of tricks for declarer, trump lead is usually right|pg||
nt|chorush: good keeping the 9 of diamond by rodwell although it wont matter here. there are times that letting the diamond 8 bcome an entry would matter|pg||
nt|barnets: could e/w get overboard here who knows|pg||
nt|algraves: only with a few scotches I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia was joking that  West hand has all power in monors - just like a book said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: minors|pg||

nt|barnets: playing 6@S in open here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric: I was thinking about heart lead[on prev hand] but I will loose my club trick|pg||
nt|barnets: auction started 1@S- 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 2N might show a 4 card limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think north's 5@D bid was not a great bid in other room|pg||
nt|gavin:  knowing your oppoonents are in an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and that their side suit (@C) isnt breaking well|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gavin:  he was extremely unlikely to be buying a singleton in either major|pg||
nt|jlall: hamman has only bid 3@D|pg||
nt|jlall: right in theory|pg||
nt|flash: quite a result from the Open Room on this one|pg||
nt|kit: why?  Looks pretty reasonable|pg||

nt|bigtrain: takes a @D lead to beat slam|pg||
nt|kit: but goes down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: west x 4@H cue and and east came in with 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff: likely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|barnets: now a real slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: players are starting to understand that stopping at 2NT is losing bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: east led a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: if he was going to do this, I like 4@D or 4@H the round before|pg||
nt|jlall: of course he didn't know they'd bid 4@D |pg||
nt|gavin:  i like levin's choice of 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: but in general I like to bid 3@D and pass or just bid 4 |pg||
nt|gavin:  i dont see a reason to expose your distribution|pg||
nt|chorush: this is a good time for a restroom break. looks like 460|pg||
nt|flash: @H7 led in other room...   i'm beginning to think that Benito was on to something...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff: 2NT is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Rodwell might well have tried 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: just on 1 finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: 50 percent|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bbramley: club ruff beats it 2, but down 1 or 2 is the same 12 imps|pg||
nt|jlall: partner is still an UPH so hamman probably bid 3@D as a constructive bid in case partner wanted to bid slam or was 54 majors, tactically I like levins bidding a lot better because ...|pg||
nt|jlall: of what actually happened|pg||
nt|barnets: I say they will bid it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: Well, stiff diamond lead works if partner has either pointed ace -- that's a concrete plan to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a swing of some kind to nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff does NOT take his time, calling for 10@d right a way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: EW seems to like the action..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Not knowing the CR result on this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|barnets: not sure why a heart was led because north xx 4@H to show first round heart control|pg||
nt|barnets: a heart then seems to play for nothing|pg||
nt|kit: He was hoping to set up a heart trick, and score his queen of spades -- I don't agree, but that must have been his thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: yes invitational 2nt is a very bad treatment to me|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|algraves: so hamman encourages because of his controls and then subsides because of his shape and Zia takes over|pg||
nt|algraves: need to make 2@C tricks for 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: The only problem now - EW bidding boxes out of PSSS cards|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: headed for 10 IMPs to Fleisher|pg||
nt|flash: 31 IMP lead with 20 boards left...|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so they are sending out for more pass cards. there is a delivery service|pg||
nt|algraves: they dont get a lot of business,|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: you feel that strongly? :)|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont hate them that much|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Witht the caps too:)|pg||
nt|algraves: Joey what is your opinion of the support double treatment, do you have one?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|me argent: they ars essential playing precesion|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I like them playing a strong club|pg||

mb|1N|nt|gavin:  24 points and lots of doubletons, but the 3 useless @H points make it not such a great game|pg||
nt|jlall: so zia could have bid 1@S, and hamman could have checked back for 4 card spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  still the opponents have to find a lead|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that the team captains involved have been sent in search of a camping-goods store to provide each of the players involved with a compass|pg||
nt|kit: 4 card major,longerminor|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel won't need any help decide which suits they are|pg||
nt|kit: right, and that should keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Thx Kit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: This axactly what Lew wrote to Eric|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@H = transfer|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S by E-W doesn't appear to have much play.  3NT?  Maybe.|pg||
nt|flash: most keep system on over X and 2@C (except when 2@C shows the majors)|pg||
nt|chorush:  4 spades not making if they get there. 3NT has some chance|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|kit: Martel trying to scramble out of what could be big danger opposite the weak NT|pg||
nt|barnets: brazil once played italy in olympiad- the whole set in same direction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: pass or correct I believe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell only ignore ARTX...  penX and 2@C are handled differently|pg||
mb|3C|an|MAX|nt|gavin:  much better played from south like in the other room|pg||
nt|flash: isn't it more 'std' to use the X of Stayman there as cards?|pg||
nt|kit: no, sorry -- it just shows hearts I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: brazil had a huge set in each room|pg||
nt|barnets: and the match was a tie|pg||
nt|kit: What is 3@C if double of 2@C shows clubs?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they used to...  but have since changed to show the suit|pg||
nt|kit: Something is inconsistent|pg||
nt|kit: Martel wants to bid high if partner's major is hearts, not if spades|pg||
nt|barnets: anot|pg||
mb|4N|nt|barnets: anot|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: anot|pg||
nt|barnets: anot|pg||
mb|5C|nt|flash: 2@H is 4th suit forcing; doesn't necessarily show @H length or strength|pg||
nt|kit: If they changed, did rodwell remember?|pg||
nt|kit: this will certainly be another double-digit pickup for Fleisher|pg||
nt|chorush: Another 12 going to Fleischer I believe|pg||
nt|flash: down 1 and down 2 are the same IMPs|pg||
nt|barnets: another poss slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Seems like 3NT should make, but was down 2 in open room|pg||
nt|kit: Can you explain Walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: explain what?|pg||
nt|kit: the bidding -- the 3@C call|pg||
nt|bigtrain: riasing @C with values?|pg||
nt|flash: according to the play record, Weinstein misguessed @Cs in the end position (took a finesse)|pg||
nt|chorush: great choice by Stansby|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry key probs|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: The auction should give declarer a road map to take 2 hearts, 3 spades, 4 clubs I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like an appropriate action|pg||
nt|barnets: in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: what if he just wanted to play in clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: what is the alert of 3@S?|pg||
nt|gavin:  my guess is they play it a little stronger than most people|pg||
nt|jlall: they play weak NT so this is strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2nd and 4th leads. Zia might lead low from doubleton, per CC|pg||
nt|mildredb: ok, thx|pg||
mb|5N|nt|chorush: Katz has a good hand; might cue now|pg||
nt|harmon: kc will keep at 5 which is almost harmonproof|pg||
nt|chorush: Nick has a minimum, wont be interested|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth doesn't know which major Stansby has, and of course he thinks the minor is clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|bbramley: stronger that standard, anyway|pg||
nt|bbramley: than|pg||
nt|gavin:  easy @H shift|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: so another IMP to Fleisher?|pg||
nt|barnets: he misgueessed the club jac|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: that is a lot of tricks they took in the closed room |pg||
nt|barnets: on the spade guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5NT is not Forcing, said Zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but I don't think we could off stop - given the match score|pg||
nt|mr murray: most certainly will guess it when he finds out the club distro|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: I think another imp to fleisher, possibly 2|pg||
nt|barnets: but he also finds the @H distribut|pg||
nt|barnets: distribution|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Does not look healthy, said Zia|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ..and call for @cA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|kit: This looks like another pickup for Nickell|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip is taking a break|pg||
nt|mr murray: nice read|pg||
nt|algraves: well that was a good play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and Zia passed to Bob his hand - asking to make a plan|pg||
nt|barnets: zia who has perhaps the best table feel around in the game drops the @CK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they may loose a match , but sure not their spirit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: fleisher gained an important 4 imps on the last partial when zia went down in 2@H|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|barnets: 41 imps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mr murray: these two slams certainlywont hurt them|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin:  not enough entries here to take care of it, so he will play for the q@S to be with west|pg||
nt|gavin:  much simpler that way|pg||
nt|gavin:  plus he can pick up 4-1 @S that way|pg||
nt|jlall: plus he can pick up 4-1 spades there|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah|pg||
nt|mildredb: great minds :)  justin & gavin :)|pg||
nt|jlall: when you don't have the 9, usually you hook towards your JT|pg||
nt|jlall: since that way you can pick up 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: if he has worked out the heart count, he may think bob would overcall with the @SQ|pg||
nt|jlall: but that is a huge view|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|barnets: meckstroth declared 3@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlall: he has made the normal play here|pg||
nt|gavin:  i dont think he was ever considering playing @S the other way, just whether to cash the A first|pg||
nt|bbramley: and even with @SQ it's still a ratty overcall w/no aces, a bad suit, a passed partner and wrong vulnerability|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gavin:  hmm|pg||
nt|mildredb: plus either could have the @H2|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah i agree, i was just thinking of what he was thinking of|pg||
nt|gavin:  good play by zia, should make it clear the K@C is onside though|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: that's surprising(?), but, again, doesn't change the IMP score|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|me argent: doubt west will missguess|pg||
nt|gavin:  or likely doesnt|pg||
nt|algraves: so Zia has to switch to @H now|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet he returns a trump:)|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@C was conventional, like the Cole convention, ie forcing 1 round, or old KS|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: It was a transfer to 2@d|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gavin:  i believe that 2@C actually showed @D|pg||

nt|jlall: 4@S would be interesting here|pg||
nt|jlall: what will stansby bid over a 1@C opener?|pg||
nt|jlall: I think NS are really aggro preemptors, so maybe 3@H|pg||
nt|jlall: yes|pg||
nt|mildredb: hmmm, I'd have thought the @S2 said no more trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: There are 3 boards to play in CR|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chorush: ugly 2NT for Nick|pg||
nt|passell: yes only 21 anda great 5 bagger  very ugly|pg||
nt|barnets: Nickells lead 4 meckwell and hamman -zia will play last two sets|pg||
nt|flash: 28-38 segment score; those rally caps seem to be working!!|pg||
nt|kit: and just like that, in 2 boards the match goes from a runaway to a contest.  It can happen.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|flash: some might be reluctant to value QJ tight as 3 HCP?|pg||
nt|chorush: if not for QJ of diamonds would be upgrade to 2C IMO|pg||
nt|barnets: 33 boards left|pg||
nt|flash: Open Room finished with the segment; last 3 boards here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|algraves: well that is the lead that beats 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: again a lot of tricks in the closed room |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S is multi -meaning|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2N asks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D shows a good shapely hand with a 3fit and long @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: through 85 boards, Diamond +95|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: seems like it might have gone diamond honor covered and ducked, then a shift|pg||
nt|flash: rather unbelievably, Zia cover the the @DQ at trick 2 (essentially same lead)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lead are attitude, said Steve|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w need to get diamonds going sap|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|jlall: on best defense this is 2 down|pg||
nt|jlall: if south gets his ruff, and north can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3N i'd guess|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but possibily 5@D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chorush: could be essential to cover the diamond|pg||
nt|kit: from declarer's point of view this hand is not cold -- spades could be 5-2 with king of diamonds off|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he should play the j and not the q because he has to cover the j|pg||
nt|kit: very good point George -- quite subtle|pg||
nt|kit: but not sure applicable here -- covering with Kxx won't work anyway|pg||
nt|chorush: He cant afford to duck the J; Really can't duck the Q either|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jlall: looks like martel gave suit preference for spades, strange|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chorush: partner might have Jx|pg||
nt|kit: and his partner might have stiff queen.  But it is a nice theme to remember|pg||
nt|harmon: can he ask shortness??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but that sets @H|pg||
nt|kit: with both black kings, this looks like better bet than 5@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Close 4@H here -- declarer has serious entry problems to his hand, and will not be able to establish and run diamonds I don't think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|chorush: so now we will have a push if levin doesnt cash|pg||
nt|flash: so now, either the @SA gets cashed or the trick goes away|pg||
nt|flash: what can i say?  the extra comma took valuable time...|pg||
nt|chorush: levin has hope that his partner has Jx of diamonds and that declarer will misguess|pg||
nt|kit: Levin will be hoping declarer doesn't have jack of diamonds and needs to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: so he won't cash -- in fact, he'll probably play back a diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: the cashout might make that holding irrelevant letting declarer have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: this is on the @S position?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he'd have to jump to 5@D to play there after|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mittmouse: i dont think he should cover the q because if declarer needs 5 tricks in the suit ducking will cover all  situatios|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks and 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: sme contract and opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: signal is u/d|pg||
nt|kit: but he can take 3 club ruffs, and with a good spade guess emerge with 6 trump tricks, 1 diamond, 2 spades, and 1 club|pg||
nt|flash: loser-on-loser in @Cs??|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: and if South had KJx of diamonds, presumably he would never cover the queen|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that in 5@D, the defense made Fleisher guess @Hs at trick 2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flash: this doesn't appear to work (on a trump shift)|pg||
nt|kit: this is another possibility -- gets him a club winner, but not a spade winner, so still needs 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jeff is holding @h5|pg||
nt|kit: trump shift looks pretty easy to find from East's point of view I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Now will have to set up the diamonds -- are the entries there?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe they are -- ace of hearts, 10 of clubs, spade to ace, diamond ...|pg||
nt|barnets: so 4@H made inopen|pg||
nt|kit: East wins, trump, king of hearts, king of diamonds, spade ruff, diamond ruff, spade ruff, good diamond -- yes, it works|pg||
nt|kit: specs say I misanalyzed -- let's see what I have wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open room where meck played  trump weinstein played a club|pg||
nt|barnets: at trick 3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||

nt|flash: help!!!   they're picking on me!!!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bbramley: @S2 should have been attitude for spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|algraves: needs to get the side suit going |pg||
nt|algraves: which he has |pg||
nt|algraves: so one down|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves: 2NT makes ns as they have 4 clubs, 2 spades and 2 aces|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: opps get 4 of the red suit they lead and the king ofclubs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|kit: Maybe if East doesn't continue trumps|pg||
nt|flash: @C now|pg||
nt|kit: yes, East plays club, West pitches diamond|pg||
nt|flash: takes away the late entry|pg||
nt|barnets: yes club now|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth has to work this out -- the trump continuation seems like the reflex play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: makes on trump|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|flash: well done by the defense|pg||
nt|kit: yes, so important on defense to work the full hand out rather than making a reflex play|pg||
nt|flash: 10 IMPs and right back where we started the segment|pg||
nt|barnets: now when north trumps a @D in dummy west can overuff and play trump|pg||
nt|kit: And 4 boards ago it looked like the match might be over -- amazing how quickly the imps can fly|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice defense|pg||
nt|barnets: dec plays @DK @S ruff @D ruff overuufed and trump back|pg||
nt|barnets: leaves him a spade loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip is thinking, Jeff is looking at the score card|pg||
nt|barnets: or he may try the @H finesse without success|pg||
nt|vbman: T|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to the defense is west discard of a diamond on the club|pg||
nt|kit: at other table play started the same, but Weinstein failed to find initial trump shift and then there were enough trumps to make.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip call for @sq|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Thankx to Jeff to correct|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|algraves: 3H down  at least 1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|barnets: in the other room east played a club and then a trump-|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: with 4-4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mildredb: take his ruff, cash @SA & pard will tell him what to do|pg||
nt|caitlin: X|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our commentators for guiding us through the boards|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gavin:  he already will have with his @H return, but yes its easy from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we bid @s first|pg||
nt|flash: and to the USBF for organizing this broadcast and inviting us to participate|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they usually lead A frum AK|pg||
nt|algraves: these guys still play bridge the values way where you raise with support and ruffing values and bid NT with no support or no ruffing value|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: very risky not leading the singleton diamond IMO -- would hate if a diamond ruff was the setting trick|pg||
nt|chorush: we should see suit preference by Rodwell here. They use upside down sp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: UD signals for defense|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out...    thnx to Serge Bondar, our operator, for another great set|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so all e's plays are SP|pg||
nt|flash: the extra information from table-side is most helpful|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our commentators for guiding us through the boards|pg||
nt|flash: there's a chance that the last set might start b4 the scheduled time at 10 past the hour|pg||
nt|kit: I'm amazed Meckstroth is having such a problem here|pg||
nt|flash: if both teams are ready to go|pg||
nt|chorush: so question is does meck know enough abou the outstanding diamonds to be sure rod calling for heart?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gavin:  he will play a high @H indicating he doesnt want another @D ruff|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@D is not a slam try, it is just to help partner judge what to do if the opps bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlall: also NS play weak NT, so north's 2H showed abotu a strong NT with 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: he knows 2nd diamond was lowest|pg||
nt|flash: Diamond +67 through board 102|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barnets: and the first swing to nickell on 115|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mildredb: diamond had 64 lead w/ 3 comparisions to come in|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|chorush: in fact, it is only that the 3 card trump holding would ruff the diamond that keeps it from being a beat|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: I am stunned|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mildredb: *has|pg||
nt|gavin:  we might see him go an extra down by attempting to take more entries with a diamond to the T|pg||
nt|gavin:  he needs to trump dummies spades and cant get there enough|pg||
nt|gavin:  so he will likely try to manufacture some extra entries in @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  that or spin the T@D right now|pg||
nt|gavin:  try to come home with 4@D 4@H in dummy and 2 in his hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|flash: next-to-last board; restart in 1/2 hour|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: as am i|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|barnets: opps miss 6@H playing 4N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out, thnx to Serge Bondar, our operator, for a great job|pg||
nt|flash: and to our commentators for guiding us through the boards|pg||
nt|flash: and, of course, thnx to Fred and the crew at BBO for giving us this great viewing platform|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D6 was attitude since it could have been from KQ...  but the 8 was 100% SP|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: I think that defense psychologically puts them out of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry, said Jeff|pg||
nt|flash: this makes the difficult even more unlikely...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cQ|nt|jlall: better spin it now|pg||
nt|passell: a rare opportunity to see these great teams meeting|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|flash: Diamond now up 98 over Weinstein, so that match is unlikely to go the distance|pg||
nt|chorush: barring anything wild on board 75, this set is going to end up with a baseball score (American league, at least)|pg||
nt|passell: you are the designated hitter Ira|pg||
nt|barnets: so match still on |pg||

nt|gavin:  nice defense, at this level you cannot get that defense wrong |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  then his partner would have lead his AK the other way because he would have 3|pg||
nt|jtr: AKx maybe leads the K|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfk: Kamil-Fleisher have had a very nice set|pg||
nt|po-s: from East.s point of view I mean - say West has five diamond|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Against pre-empts it is a good policy since you often lead unsupported Aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|po-s: then you should get your club trick going|pg||
nt|gavin:  his partner would not play the J@D|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|algraves: Well the operation was a success for Zia but the patient died|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: last board in this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will resumed in 5-7 mins|pg||
nt|flash: also, the European Championships are in full swing|pg||
nt|algraves: 3|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: my new website |pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for events and local times|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: meck likes the spots|pg||
nt|algraves: 3C was down one ew last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  isn't it possible declarer was QJ10xxxxx, Q, xx, Ax and a club was necessary?|pg||
nt|flash: another instance of stretching (?) to respond|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not with eric's signals|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Light opening bids on hands like South has are often effective, but this time will get them overboard as in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: good choice on this hand as game has lots of play|pg||
nt|kit: should be easy 4@H or 4@S contract here|pg||
nt|mildredb: dull tool that I am, I'd just pass|pg||
nt|algraves: but martel stansby good to get 110|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: If it Balcwood - I made a mistake, said Bob|pg||
nt|algraves: as theydid not get pushed to 3S down 1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gavin:  what an ugly hand to lead from |pg||
nt|gavin:  complete guesswork|pg||
nt|kit: wow -- 4@H went down in other room -- that's a surprise|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gavin:  good choice|pg||
nt|mildredb: great lead|pg||
nt|jlall: usually a major is good here, but usually Jxx is terrible|pg||
nt|jlall: so that was his problem heh|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S may not make either -- probably will go wrong in spades, so may have to guess jack of hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: This hand shows why when you have nothing, bidding nothing is a good idea.  There is that third opponent (the one across from you) you have to worry about.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein might consider passing 3@D.  The problem is that his 2@C is game-forcing, so he partner could have a really strong hand and not need to jump|pg||
nt|kit: but on this lead, it will make, as will pitch club on good diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: that will be 13imps|pg||
nt|kit: so will probably unblock diamonds, ace of spades, spade to king, king of diamonds, making 5 or 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric is asking about @d3|pg||
nt|algraves: 50 a trick as we used to say|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gavin:  the Q@S was a better technical play by stansby|pg||
nt|gavin:  need to keep the communication in the spade suit open|pg||
nt|chorush: will Katz eschew his diamonds for the unbid suit?|pg||
nt|flash: don't wander too far, folks; apparently a good chance to start again in advance of scheduled time...|pg||
nt|chorush: obviously i had no idea who was on lead|pg||
nt|flash: Diamond +80, playing Board 105; 8th segment doubtful??|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: well maybe meckwell need to x it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, not making that much, as king of diamonds ruffed, but still will make|pg||
nt|barnets: if they get there|pg||
nt|algraves: down 3 at least|pg||
nt|algraves: here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: not clear what fate of this will be, probably down 2 or 3|pg||
nt|me argent: not best|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|kit: helpful lead for declarer -- now he will do better than I had expected|pg||
nt|kit: he is in dummy|pg||
nt|kit: now I think down 1, but complicated|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Chip can finesse @d himself|pg||
nt|kit: only if he can get there -- with what crowbar?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|scotty: If Stansby flies with the second black ace.....|pg||
nt|mildredb: does N get squeezed in minors?|pg||
nt|gavin:  NS play attitude leads|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like one of those unfortunate 3NT hands where declarer is shut out of both his hand and dummy|pg||
nt|harmon: HE THERE NOW|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: I think ace of spades, spade to king is right -- if South is 2-2 in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: But Rodwell was worried about possible 4-1 spade split -- maybe he is right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|passell: down 2 is good bridge for declarer|pg||
nt|chorush: if Nick can find a duck here they might beat it more than 2|pg||
nt|harmon: oops|pg||
nt|kit: I know -- I meant on heart lead|pg||
nt|harmon: srrt for caps|pg||
nt|kit: now AK and a club probably|pg||
nt|chorush: defense is going to have to be reasonably careful here|pg||
nt|barnets: specs switch to other room to see end of match|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gavin:  so south needed to be a little concerned that his partner may have Jxxxx and that declarer has stiff K|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Nickell is afraid that if he ducks declarer can switch to clubs and have enough tricks with the spade trick stolen|pg||
nt|algraves: down two now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|passell: he took the cinch|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gavin:  this line of play didndt work out well for hamman|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't see a way that a club pitch would cost|pg||
nt|bbramley: i thought of one - if south has @CKx and @DQ, then a club pitch allows the 4th club to set up|pg||
nt|gavin:  for news and articles abt the trials and europeans and other bridge stuff pls chk out my website www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|curtis: looks like brad moss was the only one to make 3n on this board|pg||
nt|bbramley: many kibs argue that south must have @CA, else he's have played @SQ at trick one|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|chorush: as would I|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: so he will make 10 tricks now, 12 IMP pickup|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: so nickell recover39 imps in last few boards|pg||
nt|kit: odd he didn't hook Noth for jack of hearts, as no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you back here in 55 minutes and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|barnets: 49 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: actually|pg||
nt|barnets: now trail by only 20|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: He said if @hJ drops, I made 5|pg||
nt|barnets: remarkable|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein has picked up a couple of late swings to reduce the margin to 74; might have another segment there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Thx everybody for watching|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we will re-start the broadcast at 3:45CST|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|nt|kit: now diamond ruff, heart to king, diamond through, and defense gets 4 trumps, 1 club, 1 heart|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; back soon|pg||
nt|flash: scheduled in 20 minutes; may be sooner|pg||
nt|chorush: the oponents can start earlier than the announced start time for the segment if both teams agree to|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We do have a 20 minutes break, that was mixed-up with clock in our room|pg||
nt|chorush: at least, they could in the earlier rounds. if they are using duplicated boards they might not be able to|pg||
nt|flash: 20 minutes it is...   hope to see you all back then|pg||
nt|algraves: but martel did not want to lose the setting trick if Zia had ten bizillion spades to ak j|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|mildredb: bye all|pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|gavin:  ty|pg||
mc|8|nt|kit: spade through doesn't accomplish much -- North has good 10 of clubs|pg||
nt|flash: we're running a bit late, so don't be surprised if they give the players a few extra minutes between sets|pg||
nt|kit: I think all roads lead to down 1 |pg||
nt|chorush: there will likely be a 15 minute break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Eric is taking his time|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all allan specs|pg||
nt|algraves: ok everyone run to 18 green |pg||
