mb|1N|an|12-15 balanced|nt|jlall: so I guess hudsons line was justified :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|me argent: south better take care here not to get overboard after partners lgt opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: the NS pair at this table is 10 and 12 yo respectively, both became the youngest life master at one point|pg||
mb|2S|an|!|nt|dude2010: yes, when patner opens and i have 19 i am slam bound ((especially playing 2/1))|pg||
nt|me argent: north s 3@CS is a huge overbid |pg||
nt|dude2010: partner*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: West is a high school sophmore while east is a student at California Berkely |pg||
nt|dredog03: yes.|pg||
nt|dude2010: NS play canape, EW play standard. both precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in this event multiple pairs are playing extremely wide ranged 1nt openers, can create swings but also missed games|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|me argent: hard to imagine south stopping short of slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: Even picking up the whole spade suit and q@d, one trick short|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: yes, some precision pairs like a super wide NT range so that their diamond is not nebulous|pg||
nt|jlall: not a fan of that myself|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dredog03: me neither. i personally prefer to limit the nt range to 13-15 and just pass the flat 12's.|pg||
nt|jlall: marriott knows his partner doesn't have much so just goes for the most passive lead|pg||
nt|dredog03: i like the passive club lead|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah definitely good lead|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Endmund thinking|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dude2010: the CR gives NS some breathing room with 4@h-1|pg||
nt|me argent: north must learn when opening light to limit his hand  at his 2nd bid |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|me argent: not that it would have helped here |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Wu explained his reasoning for bidding 2@h as he wanted to play a 4-4 fit as opposed to a 5-4 :)|pg||
nt|me argent: that reasoning only applies at higher levels when weak you want to play where you have the most trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 4@s need a trump lead here?|pg||
nt|jlall: unlucky, i don't think marriott played it badly|pg||
nt|jlall: nice defense |pg||
nt|jlall: I guess this is another 1N opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 12-15 back in action again :) , invite + accept?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dude2010: not a modern 1nt opener for Wu|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Stiff ace grossly anti%, not even an option to open 1nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jlall: west will have to invite opposite 12-15, and east can reject with 4333 13|pg||
nt|jlall: i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|an|no gaurantee of 4 cd major|nt|me argent: think south will lead @C10 vs 4@Ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: wow, :x, i suppose when i said agressive bidder i underestimated :)|pg||
nt|dude2010: T@cs seems normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Green thinking about it|pg||
nt|jlall: i think playing a 4 point range, when you're on the bottom half with no 5 card suit etc you need to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: rizzo might invite with a good 10 hoping to play game opp 14-15|pg||
pc|s3|nt|me argent: 3@Ss seems like the rgt evaluation with west but all roads lead to game|pg||
nt|dude2010: yes, but now Dhir gets to take credit :)|pg||
nt|me argent: only if they make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Would predict the logical line to be to simply start roughing diamonds, if they draw 2 rounds of trumps after the first diamond, still ok?|pg||
nt|dude2010: Edmund is taking his time, something that isnt very common in a junior event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: as we saw in the previous match, where Das made two errors as a result of playing too fast, there's no hurry :)|pg||
nt|me argent: EW have only 2 losers on top but unfortunately they have a dearth of winners|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: good pass on this hand, the hands fit very poorly with AQx opp KJx|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlall: this was not best|pg||
nt|dredog03: as with earlier hands, passive defense is best here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: in theory now can set up 2@d 1@h 3@c and 2@s|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer can get 2 diamonds, 2 spades, 3 clubs, and a heart|pg||
nt|dredog03: this may wind up letting green make it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|me argent: good switch by a jeng|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlall: the defense is threatening 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, and a spade though|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlall: marriott needs to duck|pg||
nt|jlall: else he has no entry to his long heart|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|me argent: here its saying i dont know what i am doing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i think edmund discarded b4 realizing the k@h had been roughed|pg||
nt|dude2010: edmund deciding if he wants to be in his hand or on the board|pg||
nt|dude2010: yes, playing too quickly once again|pg||
nt|me argent: think it breaks out even|pg||
nt|me argent: since south had short @Cs and @Ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: could he not have overroughed, roughed a diamond, club back to hand, roughed the last diamond, roughed a heart, then draw last trump?|pg||

nt|dude2010: yet there still have been 17 imps|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 1@d or 1nt?|pg||

nt|jlall: oh they play 11-14|pg||
nt|jlall: i think its too good|pg||

mb|1D!|an|Either 4+ !d Longer Maj  or 6+!d or m's|nt|jlall: it will be interesting to see if he rebids 1N or 2C|pg||

mb|1H|nt|dougdscsu: 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: Modern style opens the north hand 1nt, reflected in the closed room, 1@s the choice by north here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|me argent: bridge is a hard enough game without making SILLY mechanical errors|pg||
nt|dredog03: 1NT rebid is probably conventional showing some kind of canape hand.|pg||
nt|jlall: oh ok|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: their 1@c opening followed by 1nt shows 15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: now north must bid 2nt|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|dude2010: heavy pass by S|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: never shy to reach into his bidding box, arjun |pg||

nt|jlall: ill bet on 2N also|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfj: this, will be fortunate to escape undoubled|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Hudson "yay, i get to be dummy"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall: the 9 lead is telling|pg||

pc|s4|nt|dude2010: X|pg||

nt|dude2010: i would|pg||

mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: lol|pg||
nt|dude2010: this will not turn out well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlall: EW have 3 top tricks, so it will be a question of if they can get the fourth or not|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: we broke the streak of identitical contracts|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|me argent: bob hamman is a great example one of reasons he is so tough to play against is that he can have a disaster and move on to next board like nothing bad happened|pg||

nt|dude2010: had they made 4@hs in the other room it wouldnt have been as bad|pg||

nt|jlall: spade is very hit or miss, but its reasonable with a weak hand to try your strongest major here|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Do they lead the 9 then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hard to believe they lead 2nd and 4th in partner's suit - I'd think the same as Jeng that he'd raised on 3 small and didn't want his partner to think he had an honor.|pg||

nt|jlall: however if rizzo really had KQxxx and green really led small from 3 small, how would rizzo know to lead small the 2nd time?|pg||
nt|jlall: he would think his partner had Txxx and declarer AJ doubleton|pg||
nt|jlall: and if spades are 4-4 we are only talking about an overtrick, and if green has 5 spades the play doesnt matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 25, smack dab in the middle|pg||
nt|jlall: the biggest problem there was that marriott just played way too fast|pg||
nt|dredog03: very right sir.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: another 2nt -3nt |pg||
nt|jlall: it's not a race, that is the type of play you can take your time on, I know if he thought about it he could have come up with the right answer there|pg||
nt|dude2010: something we have seen a lof of in this junior tournament|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|me argent: 7@Cs aint a terrible contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: he will force to slam gauranteed|pg||
nt|dude2010: he certainly wont stop short of slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: its something i think juniors (myself included) are more prone to doing. look at the open trials right now, they play very very slow and thats fine|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jlall: wouldnt surprise me if declarer just cashed out here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: basically it depends on @Cs breaking or a stiffJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I predict will bid 7 upon finding all the keycards|pg||
nt|dude2010: yes, clm 10 and go home|pg||
nt|jlall: he cant really risk leading a diamond up|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|dude2010: i vote 6@ss over 4@ss|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfj: Edmund thinking over 4nt, perhaps going to try and show 2 + side void?|pg||
nt|dude2010: after a long enough tank 5@s will show that hand exactly :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: also worth noting, EW may think they are further behind then they actually are, hard to know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: certainly there may be a director needed in some kind of scenario where dhir goes to 7|pg||
nt|me argent: thats always an error|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but these players don't know much about those aspects of the game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|me argent: one never knows whats going on in other room|pg||

nt|grypho:  you may only get one or two opportunities in a lifetime to play for a world championship .  To win, you MUST learn to play slower.|pg||

nt|jlall: cant his partner have a normal t/o X still with like 12 and a stiff diamond? |pg||

mb|3H|nt|jlall: he can make game opp that |pg||
nt|dredog03: but would green know to double? how much has west shown in terms of values?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: rizzo can balance with 3@S|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 3 boards to go, less than a board, excitement to come !:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 75 kibs seems a bit light :p|pg||
nt|me argent: 1nt by EW is contract CR|pg||
nt|jlall: great lead anyways :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: While play has not been "deliberate" here, it has certainly been more thoughtfull than the other tables, a good sign.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|3+ 11-15|mb|2C!|an|Either Natural 2!c or weak 3!c bid|nt|jlall: 5@D is pretty close here, but with the heart jack off i dont think its doable|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, that is very good|pg||
nt|jlall: hudson in particular takes his time|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: you can really only bid 2@d with this hand since 1@d is 2+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jlall: i'd like to see north make a responsive X|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: in standard methods it is worth a limit raise|pg||
nt|jlall: perfect hand type|pg||
nt|dredog03: 1@d is 3+ i believe.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 5@d might sneak home if trumps are never lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: doesnt look like the cards will allow rizzo to pull this one out|pg||
nt|jlall: yes if you could ruff 2 spades and 2 hearts in your hand|pg||
nt|jlall: it might be possible|pg||
nt|jlall: since north can never overruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the defence will get a few chances to do it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jlall: on this lead|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer can pull trumps|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: thanks again everyone, pleasure, two more boards in this semifinal match, followed by a 1 hour 20 minute break and the beginning of a 48 board usa1 final and usa2 semifinal|pg||
nt|jlall: weak NT from hudson|pg||
nt|jlall: and they will be in deep trouble|pg||
nt|dredog03: this could be another loss for the weak notrump|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: if Rizzo penalty doubles, taht is|pg||
nt|jlall: red/white it is so dangerous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Two more boards remaining this Segment, the next is scheduled to begin in approximately 10 minutes following board 16, Would like to Give a Special thanks to our wonderful ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: commentators Justin Lall, Sean Gannon, Doug Dey, Andre Asbury, and Kevin wilson, great job!|pg||
nt|jlall: some people wonder how much you need to double a weak NT, a good general rule is 15+, but some 14s should qualify (especially with a good suit to lead/bid)|pg||
nt|dredog03: Even I would penalty double this one|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14|nt|jlall: thanks matt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dude2010: making 6@s here, but not an easy on to bid with a 2@h-4@h preempt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: looks like a 4@h bid for wu|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: arjun needed to hold the north hand in order for someone to get to slam on this hand :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW can make 3NT as it happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: More fun than the open trials, after the nickell exit :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: missed game at both tables|pg||
nt|jlall: both tables play partscore wtih 25 HCP, very unusual for a junior event!|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 're done :))|pg||
nt|dude2010: if i were was playing it would go down|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jlall: marriott makes the most aggressive lead since he has a yarb and needs desperate measures|pg||
nt|dredog03: its such a wide range of hands west can have, so east cannot safely go on..|pg||
nt|jlall: i like his lead again|pg||
nt|mrdct: well i guess green is expecting such a strong hand - dbl was certainly the winning action vs the weak NT|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|jlall: green has a good hand, even if partner shouldnt have a balanced 15, he could easily have a 6-4 13 count or whatever where game makes|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: if they win a game swing|pg||
nt|dude2010: what would happen with a tie, matt?|pg||
nt|dude2010: BAM?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I doubt it, i'm sure a playoff would occur, would have to ask the directors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Certainly not a BAM|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would imagine a playoff|pg||
nt|jlrice: I think he needs to aggressively X the weak NT    could be easily getting 800 where no game has play their way|pg||
nt|mrdct: @c lead will beat 4@S i think|pg||
nt|dredog03: Rizzo and Green are definitely one of the more conservative pairs in the U21 field.|pg||
nt|mrdct: or @D and @C switch - the defence just need to set up their @C trick before it goes on the long @H|pg||
nt|jlall: they might not play 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|jlall: if i opened 2@S you could bid 4@S with the south hand, not sure about marriott :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I hope I don't have to find out|pg||
nt|me argent: decent 4@HS that will probably fail if north leads his singelton|pg||
nt|dredog03: NS do not play 2@s as weak|pg||
mb|2S|an|weak|nt|dredog03: or i thought they didnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: i guess they do|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mrdct: that's a pretty good hand for a green vs red weak 2|pg||
nt|jlall: if they play feature, north will show no feature and south will pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: i think they play ogust|pg||
mb|3S!|an|Good suit good hand|nt|jlall: so if north shows good/good south will try game|pg||
nt|mrdct: good hand good suit i guess|pg||
nt|jlall: and north showed good suit bad hand south would pass|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would play this as good suit bad hand  as has no second round controls of other suits|pg||
nt|mrdct: now green needs to lead a minor|pg||
nt|jlall: depends on your style whether you show a good hand, I don't think a Q outside and 6322 is good enough for it though|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dude2010: not quite a decent 5@hs thought|pg||
nt|me argent: and will probably fail if north doesnt lead his singelton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Wow... EW having a disaster in the closed, had he passed out 4@h, likely wuld have been enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: bad hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: also depends on how weak they can open 2@s at this vul|pg||
nt|dredog03: I would not consider that a good hand. Q outside isnt enough|pg||
nt|jlall: so|pg||
nt|jlall: @HK lead or @CQ?|pg||
nt|dredog03: @cQ lead looks normal to me|pg||
nt|jlall: theyre both quite attractive|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dougdscsu: im for @h king|pg||
nt|jlall: I think i would lead this also, not sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice lead|pg||
nt|jlrice: K of hearts less attractive now that he has seen dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Hudson "this is the first time you've ever bid 3@s over ogust"|pg||
