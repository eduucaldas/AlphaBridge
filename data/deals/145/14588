mb|1S|nt|chorush: This hand appears to be an easy 4 spades for NS, with the diamond ace right|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands -- attacking @C would have let contract make - but i think playing @H gave better chance of going down ONLY 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and no reason @HKx couldn't be in west|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another [ugly?] upgrade to 14|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: many pointing out  low @C [not cashing Ace] before @H finesse better -- works in actual case and @H finesse still available if @C not good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i guess he didnt overtake the heart, then had no entry left for the 4th one|pg||
nt|me argent: must admit i am a 2@C overcaller with souths hand a TOX wouldnt enter my mind|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am with you Joey|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: they will end in 4@S whatever north opened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: K&R  thinks north is worth all of 12.30    http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|lml: dies it count the nice 10's|pg||
nt|lml: does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 14-16   2@D= @H or @S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: I think it is 13 no more and no less|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|lml: hi Allan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- K&R looks at 10s -- but really doesn't like Queens|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb:  I mean the team names. Both of you have them backward|pg||
nt|lml: well they go better with the 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in combination|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: they don't want to get too high here but I don't imagine they will|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S = safe but 5@S = not safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could be "Baze"  @S raise, unspecified shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 & 9 card suits have not been all that rare this week|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: then 4@C=1@C  [3N would be some void]|pg||
nt|lml: whatever they are doing they doing have the tickets for a slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C takes the early Tap to beat.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharynr: and they have found the lead!|pg||
nt|me argent: with souths hand why make double for takeout when you dont want partner to bid any suit but @Cs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharynr: any explanation to the 3@D bid Operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no explanation given to 3d|pg||
nt|kjadams: finding the winning defense would be superhuman.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: well that wont work!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 3d actually by Diamond..I will correct|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS using udca|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfd: as to the team names on the green vugraph bars:  yes the names are entered there reversed|pg||
nt|lml: 6 imps to Diamond when Greco-Hampson got a plus in a partscore on the previous deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: e-w lead 3rd from even, low from odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for 5 of 6 pairs in finals are available online  follow link for the team under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=18&task=list|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that Greco is safe no matter what he does since Fleisher can only give Kamil one ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: !Q very loud scream for @S shift|pg||
pc|cA|nt|me argent: its obvious what 3@Ds from east was|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: say WHAT?|pg||
nt|me argent: an overbid|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco has to guess the trump jack|pg||
nt|lml: yes he does but Kamil was less likely to lead a singleton with good trump so I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein flew @HA then dropped @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: thats the easy way!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more info at other table where opening lead was dummy's suit.   Here Fleisher's non-double of 3@H lulled declarer into playing low|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfd: I will check with COO and see what to do|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|2H|nt|robinswr: 1diamond shows an unbalanced hand. they open 1club with all balanced hands |pg||
nt|robinswr: unbalanced hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: Walter do Hamson-Greco use many of the RM precision gadgets?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a few|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but their @C auctions are very different|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: for instance...  the first auction would have shown @C and @H by the two hands but in RM it would have been responder with @C and opener with @H  :)|pg||
nt|harmon: 3n I think cold here|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually 2hearts shows a six-card suit at these colors and some players do it on five so 2hearts does not describe this hand |pg||
nt|sbeatty:  2H seems a little conservative at this vul.|pg||
nt|harmon: 4h down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chorush: Diamond is fotunate that 4H, which seems normal, wont make ona diamond lead|pg||
nt|harmon: and 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: no 4s wont make just 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|harmon: not forcing Walter??|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm surprised|pg||
nt|robinswr: partnerships decide whether this is forcing or not|pg||
nt|gulyas: a hangulat?|pg||
nt|chorush: a club toward the king and a club back would get the defense to draw trumps quickly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think it was intended as forcing|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky for greco that 4hearts has four losers|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chorush: if it were intended as forcing i would certainly have expected Hampson to bid. He has a monster cmpared to what partner would expect|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|d8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Fleisher is endplayed|pg||
nt|robinswr: when partner leads shortness, the main signal is suit preferance which is what kamil meant by his jace|pg||

mb|1D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|algraves: @d lead beats 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves: or switch after 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice over the nebulous 1@D how Kamil's DBL focuses just on majors|pg||
nt|lml: its probably easiest to do if West is on lead |pg||
nt|lml: the diamond ruff|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|me argent: 4@Hs good contract EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW play 1N=12-14 except  3rd seat vul vs not|pg||

nt|kjadams: and this is better contract!|pg||

nt|reisig: 3@hX is better :)|pg||
nt|me argent: think levin much too strong for his preempt|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: so two chances to find the ruff|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Moss opened the west hand   Martel obviously likes better 12 counts for unfav 1N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: hampson might try 3 rounds of @C [with finesse]|pg||
nt|lml: good point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Weinstein in 5@D  --  that won't fetch either|pg||
nt|algraves: it really is an " obvious " singleton |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i guess their 1@D is always unbalanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|kjadams: against my preempts it's right to pass with North hand.   Seems not so vs Levin|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [not 19-20 bal]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a worthy 12-14|pg||

nt|ahollan1: previous hand, unsupported queens, 4333   yuk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Steve -- not worst vul|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would have opened but i open some balanced 11's|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: 4@S touc and go|pg||
nt|lml: Hampson cant love the turn this auction has taken... how to get in the minors...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D & @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the problem with DONT is that you don't know the lengths of the two suits|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|me argent: 3@Hs = 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: dangerous spot for Levin to double but his side can make 2 or 3 spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: kib points out that best def does set the last hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: a good disciplined pass I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this should go down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: he cant get enough pitches for his hearts without the opposition ruffing|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is the killing lead and North will just play normally , pitch a heart and play spades. He has no reason not to expect 7 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is reluctant to duck first heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: sky 1st club and arrange for 2 diamond ruffs with spade as entry.|pg||
nt|me argent: always a mistake to double a partscore when best one can do is beat it 1 wiith perfect defence too many accidents can happen|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kjadams: yes.  I am sure North wanted to bid "undouble"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Weinstein needs an uppercut to get three trumps to go with three aces|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chorush: look like diamond should start with the spade K|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1N=good 13-16    Martel's NT would be 12-14  will he open 1N or 1@D? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think just coincidence that 2@D bid corresponds to DONT    actually 2minor = minor + unknown major|pg||
nt|robinswr: same principle|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|chorush: If I were Martel, I might think the trick taking potential of this hand is more than 14|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled and again  North becomes declarer  and both lead @CJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chorush: slightly conservative rebid and NS will miss the aggressive 4 heart contract that would make on a good day|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: they might make it on this layout depending on the lead|pg||
nt|algraves: meanwhile they can make at 5 @H from south , 4@S from north|pg||
nt|lml: without a diamond lead they can discard diamonds on spades and go about setting up clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is true|pg||
nt|algraves: but they really dont have the stuff to bid too much higher|pg||
nt|lml: no they shouldnt be there for sure|pg||
nt|lml: its just that if they get carried away in the auction they may luck out|pg||
nt|algraves: they might crawl up to 5 but that seems pushy|pg||
nt|algraves: we dont know what there bids mean in any depth, but they do undoubtedly . so all we can do is wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe JoAnna will learn if   a) 1N limits hand beyond 8-11 bal  b) 3@C agree @H|pg||
nt|lml: the thing is that from Greco's point of view 8-11 is enough if its the right cards|pg||
nt|lml: the @CK alone would make it decent add the a major jack and even better|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|algraves: well he needs some key jacks to make it a good slam|pg||
nt|algraves: and the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: South passed initially and would have opened 1@D with bal 11 so South is limited|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher can kill the whole thing if he leads the @DA if they do get to slam since the @Ck has to score|pg||
nt|algraves: JXX, KJXX, AXX  XXX is a good 6 hearts basically needing 3-2 trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|algraves: whatever 4@S was Hampson had had enough|pg||
nt|lml: he knew they could safely play in spades|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: North alerted 4@S,    and South did not alert 4@S     earlier bidding showed exactly 3@S4@H in south|pg||
nt|robinswr: but no redouble|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: aha   thanks JoAnna|pg||
nt|algraves: so they had a key card misunderstanding here , Where is Eddie Kantar when they need him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it seems that 3@C was part of the pattern showing to describe 3-4 majors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @S raise guarantees 4  [support dbl situation]|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: something of a difference in evaluation|pg||
nt|me argent: another slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: agree.   Not that the 2D bid created worries where the other table was silent.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Not = Note  :-)|pg||
nt|me argent: true norths 1nt opening showed 13 15 points in this room and 15 17 points in other room but still south could have tried|pg||
mb|2S|nt|algraves: in the other room south passed 2@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: since their 1diamond is limited they can make preemptive bids here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever run out of pass cards Allan?|pg||
nt|algraves: I am not sure Martel would bid normally with that hand., but he is probably getting a little tired of being pushed around|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss'  3N on 22  -200   |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Moss also bid 2@H  but playing standard Weinstein could only bid 2@S and there it ended|pg||
nt|algraves: well they have all their assets working for them. and the suits break|pg||
nt|algraves: somehow EW have to get a force going on dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an effective lead as it establishes the @d trick before declarer can take a pitch|pg||
nt|robinswr: they have four top losers |pg||
nt|kjadams: possible Beer hand  (Diamond 7 takes last trick in 6H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: no spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=transfer  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: thx JoAnna -- that is better than my just saying 2@H was trf|pg||

nt|algraves: if they are they let me make an unmakeable game|pg||

nt|robinswr: stansby decided to treat his hand as a strong notrump|pg||
nt|algraves: yes lots of handling with the bad breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see 2@S can include what many call a strong NT opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not convinced he treated it as a strong NT as much as he doesn't have any rebid problems|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play strong notrump vul in 3rd seat only|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreed, but there is no guarantee that rebidding 1@s is 15-17 right?|pg||
nt|algraves: really there is no way to make 6@S|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sbeatty:  Interesting...the hand is definately worth 2NT but is may wrong side the contract (theoretically)|pg||
nt|chorush: not Kamil's failure to use Stayman. 2 advantages: won't go set in 4-4 bad suit on bad break and doesnt help opps with lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: yes, and in theory, not best for slam bidding usually -- but 1m then 2N is hardly any better|pg||
nt|robinswr: might be worth 20 but maybe it would be better played from partner's hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chorush: He will probably use the club to develop the niinth trick because of the relative spot strength|pg||
nt|kit: This double holdup is probably right.  If Fleisher goes after the wrong minor first, he may have a chance to recover if spades are 5-2 and Hampson can't get in twice.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR is a hand evaluation tool http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's some UNDO JoAnna |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes he really did win trick one with the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kjadams: note that he had to play 2 hearts before doing that so that declarer did not have transportation.  JD could have made by hooking club while he still had diamond exit.|pg||

nt|chorush: yes, and he will duly go set at least one|pg||
nt|passell: Levin did well not to lead the K of clubs it would have given away the club suit and the whole hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK useless  so  2N probably gets more credit than 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room -- very different auctions|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 aces and 3rd seat = upgrade to 2N opener|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: this is friendly for NS|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|chorush: yes, after the king of club lead declared might wellguess both the diamond and spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes up for last hand being friendly for NS   [sarcasm]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he's going to be happy at the location of the trumps|pg||
nt|algraves: yes and the diamond offside so no slam|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|passell: a game try seems to be in order|pg||
nt|algraves: smooth duck by Fleisher , Hampson has good feel in those situations|pg||
nt|algraves: kamil is thinking he could tap dummy and guaranette trump tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: trick|pg||
nt|algraves: regardless he has no losing option now after the spade misguess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: doesn't @CK mean down 2?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|chorush: although this defense is gong to pinpoint the KQ of clubs in Levins hand, the practical effect might be to enable declarer to go set 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college days, that [down 1] was definition of good bridge  |pg||
nt|passell: yes winning the club K might have worked  |pg||
nt|chorush: Levin is likely to play the spade J if trumps are led from south|pg||
nt|passell: it would have shown up later anyway though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin leans back in his chair to consider the position here|pg||
nt|passell: a diamond now and a club back would lead to an interesting end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anybody know if Weinstein ever opens 3rd seat 1@H with only 4? |pg||
nt|passell: if Steve had the KJ of dia instead of the ace and declare had 4 clubs it would be neccessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably unlikely with Platnick 4@S call regardless|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 very likely result from here|pg||
nt|chorush: Im certain he does although more and more people are using a jump to 3 here as mixed instead of preemptive. Don't know if Levin and Weinstein are part of that group|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|me argent: hard to dump @CQ if @C lead from dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for down 1  it needs a different name|pg||

mb|p|nt|robinswr: the more they preempt the more guesses you have to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  was wondering if that would be 3@S bid [asking for @S stop]|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|algraves: maybe that induced the spade misguess|pg||
nt|algraves: so 6NT a good contract |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: really?|pg||
nt|algraves: as it has 12 top tricks |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like 2spades - 3spades as michaels|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: that way you can play 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just weaker than leaping michaels?|pg||

nt|algraves: no finesses, no breaks required|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21  @D suit worth AT least one more point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, wasn't counting on 4@s|pg||
nt|robinswr: since stansby will not find an 8-card fit, he'll be conservative|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: that was down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I will correct it, thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: if the play went as shown|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-20|pg||
nt|kjadams: me either.   the big flaw for me is the doubleton heart.   Partner might want to play 2H when we belong in Spades.|pg||
nt|me argent: but no harm no foul|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|passell: he will have a chance to shift unless declarer sneaks in a spade|pg||

nt|robinswr: smolen|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3hearts shows five spades and four hearts|pg||

nt|algraves: 4,5 honour count and huge suit. almost 2@C then 2nt|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|algraves: but you can only upgrade so much|pg||
nt|robinswr: pick a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 4@C now any 54(40)?   [where 4@D needed to show 4@S 6@H]|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|robinswr: i don't think stansby will pass this|pg||
