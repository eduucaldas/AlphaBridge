mb|1S|mb|p|nt|peachy: fast pace at this table|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||
nt|lmeili: looks like 12 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
pc|dA|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lmeili: he hears |pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: I dont think even 5 makes|pg||
nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the slam is actually not bad with reasonable splits, but here the splits are not good|pg||

nt|haans: easier i N would have played @DJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: group B is broken|pg||
nt|wygbe1: for example, with 22 d and 43 clubs, the slam spreads - |pg||
nt|wygbe1: even with 31 d and 43 clubs has play|pg||
nt|peachy: right. And if it does make, vul slam is expensive to miss|pg||
nt|andersk: Most 1 @S opening does not have 6 tricks, almost incredible that he opened weak 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be very hard if @s's are 4-1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|tomi2:  gogoman should ruff the heart now with the queen and wait por partners spade tricks later|pg||
nt|yuval10: has N ruff with the 9@s now the contract would've gone down|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we have good and bad news from German open team. Good news is, that declarer managed to get 10 tricks in spades in this board. Bad is, that they bid slam...|pg||

nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
mb|d|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|r|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||

nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||

nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||

nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||

nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||

nt|yuval10: another interesting hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H must be transfer|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|vasmar: I think 6@h make played by E (if she guesses diamonds) unless S underlead clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Presumably to allow more time for a decent bottle in the evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: making 5|pg||

nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|eweber: Drijver no longer has to worry about a @d through his 10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: but has to take care of communication to make his 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might get stranded with @HA|pg||
nt|eweber: playing @h first might help, but both J and K are wrongsided|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andersk: fortunate @C split|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safety for 4-1 break.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rigas_karo: actuallt q@s and @d, declarer has to guess what to do for the overtrick, but both lines work|pg||

mc|11|nt|eweber: ...unless|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there is a reason|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he thinks @CK is onside|pg||
nt|eweber: ...he thinks @c finess is working and wants to get back to his hand now|pg||
