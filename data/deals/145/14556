nt|vdoubleu: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: N, last of this half - they still have 16 to play in the semi-final match. Then a break and then 32 boards of a 48 board final in the USA1 bracket and semi-final in the USA2 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: bracket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: The open players are a little behind, despite playing only 15 boards - I don't know whether we'll restart a bit after both of the Junior matches have finished or wait for the Open ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: so there won't be too much noise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfb: I do know that we'll cover the other match for the second half here, unless it looks very one-sided|pg||

nt|hedyg: ambiguous 1@d opening, they play strong @c|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfb: BOth E & W are writing notes - probably that E could have 54 in the minors either way, but I can't actually see|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Das did not find the K@C lead in OR to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In the other rm, there was no porblem for N/S to get to game|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Adam (K) opened it w/1D (as North)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I wouldn't open it playing 2/1|pg||
