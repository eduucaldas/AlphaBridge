pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Or 6@D. A 50%er the last. @H a bit lower|pg||

nt|mrdct: Ernie's @D suit not really good enough to stick his neck out vulnerable at the 4-level|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: correct guesses needed in both @S and @D to make 4@s|pg||
mb|p!|an|Shows spades|nt|serhat: this might be a pick up for Prescott team|pg||
nt|rodal f: And the @D suit will run|pg||
nt|mrdct: and once he learns it's @s he might just shut up|pg||
nt|mrdct: if anything 3@c|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i would be passing|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 2@s bid implies a handful of @hs|pg||
nt|mrdct: i.e. a hand that is going to compete to at least 3@h opposite a weak 2 in @h but wants to play in 2@s opposite a weak w in @S|pg||
nt|mrdct: the concern for gill is that there will be plenty of hands gosney could hold where 3NT makes|pg||
nt|mrdct: i wonder what a delayed 2NT should mean after a multi 2@d|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Range ask|pg||
mb|2N|an|Balanced hand 13+ HCP|mb|p|mb|3C|an|Stayman|nt|serhat: now NS nows the H fit of opponents. Dyke might be 2h  to stay out|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Only Gill and I don't know what the 2D bid is...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT normaly use to tell minor. Even at this bid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably quite a good agreement - so what are the respnses?|pg||
nt|mrdct: if 3@c shows minimum - that is quite convenient for gill who can just pass it with his nice @c suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are the @D suit skiped from EW now?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: 17 imps up for grabs on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: brown will win 8 or lose 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Made by there system, where EW had no defence.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|rodal f: Stange bids for me:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: should get @S right as he's going to lead up to the K|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: N-S finally realise why Howard doubles..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: although still and issue with the 3rd @h|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 10 minutes remaining|pg||
nt|mrdct: seems strange to me too|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'll find responses out after board|pg||
nt|mrdct: why on earth would gosney want to bid stayman?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Started at 2NT. S don't have for that bid.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: never seen this auction before|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they are playing system on after the 2NT bid then a transfer to @h woudl make some sense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: 2nt seems ok, but no aces for 3nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Martin:) and welcomed u are.|pg||
nt|mrdct: did both north and south describe 3@c the way to their screenmates?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: Ernie might put declarer to the test in @d now with the @D9|pg||
nt|mrdct: what did gosney describe it as?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|jcwla: That choice of leads might be the match.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: going for teh overtrick, just rubbning it in|pg||
nt|serhat: but @S lead was not a good idea. when holding J10983 @H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2D is for the Majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would never expect gill to be strong after passing|pg||
nt|rodal f: By non E or W limiteded?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i agree with gill's initial pass as chances are it's a weak 2 in @h and he can make a t/o dbl of that - but 2NT should only be pulled out of the box if you have a clear agreement ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: about it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree, as long as S want to bid.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so double first then 3@C|pg||
nt|mrdct: anyway it's good for the match as robinson badly need some imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass then 3c sounds merely competitive|pg||
mc|7|nt|rodal f: Shows to strong cards, wich S don't have|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think gill's problem was he was assuming rho had a weak 2 in @h and would get a nice easy t/o dbl next round|pg||
