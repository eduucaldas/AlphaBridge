nt|hawe45:  bonjour de Copenhague|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok fine Thierry, ty|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vbman: this german pair is my favourite|pg||
nt|vbman: this is heart against diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial available both sides.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Paul and all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  a very important match for both teams, who will both be aiming for a top finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: 130 is available for ew|pg||
nt|rmb1: Robin Barker in Exeter, UK.  A civilised 12 noon here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fredin may bid 3@s more for the lead than anything else|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: Welcome to the 50th european team championship from Ostend in Belgium. This is the 5th day of the open event. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: yes my choice|pg||
nt|mamos: North has woken up in a frisky mood|pg||
nt|eweber: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: south thinks Oh gawd here we go again|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eweber: 2@s shows 4-9 and Sabine is not known for underbidding|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the placement of cards 4@H has a good play for NS.|pg||
nt|dimi: Iceland (200 VP) the current leader of group A is facing Germany (168.5 VP) the fifth of group A |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: looks aty least down 1     had a place with spade finesse right|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe I should add that it shows @s+m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello all!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S shows 5+ 5+ minor 4-9 so about as expected i guess|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vbman: yes 2 or 3d|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the 1NT range?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says (14)15-17|pg||
nt|haans: do not expect a dim loser|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Makeable contract, the defense taking 1@C+1@H+1@S=3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello haans.|pg||
nt|haans: bad lead :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E had no choice, imo:)|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for wijs-muller seams to be new entry|pg||
nt|paulg:  now Fredin wishing he'd bid 3@s!|pg||
nt|dimi: hi Gerben :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all, hi dimi and gerben!|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: plsuppose he does not want south in|pg||
nt|haans: well lots of @H not correct for bids|pg||
nt|dimi: unfortunately it is not possible to identify the players yet|pg||
nt|Gerben42: possible swing board|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Jan :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: some pairs will be in 6, unfortunately both opps have an obvious @C lead...|pg||
pg||

nt|bjacobs: At this table, the 2@C overcall would have discouraged South, with @CJx|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is a meaty hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The hearts are open in 3NT ... if it's reached, the defence has to avoid blocking the suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: @H suit may be blocking in 3NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5d can be made by intra finesse in cl|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|psridhar: club to 9 and then queen from dummy...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Smirnov decides to sell his hand as "inv+ with @D fit" since 1@D virtually promisses 5 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: excellent judgment as it turns out ...now east will reach 5d for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@D might also make by eliminating the majors, then simply trying to lose the first club trick to the @CK|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: But, I'm not sure these options add up to a better chance than simply playing a club to the queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, it's all going to be irrelevant if East bids a slam|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|tomi2: E hoped for some more points than @SJ, @HQ, @CQ  but maybe he should have tried to investigate and not just blackwood...|pg||
nt|psridhar: could it be 6d d2 and 3n d1 at other tbl for 2 imps to iceland Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems rather unilateral of East to bid this way.  Can he not consult partner?  For example, with a 3@H splinter over 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, no doubt, Piekarek will be happy to see @CK offside|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Piekarek looks like he is going to look for a pseudo squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|psridhar: Baldursson followed to trumps with 7 first and then the 3....any significance ?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|c3|nt|tomi2: @D7 discard = I won't score a beer this deal ;)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it could be operator playing a card for him at random - or the trump echo could show something about his shape|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: othe room 5d was made on elimination lines and then guessing location of club king|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: Not just a guess - the bidding helped declarer enormously|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk6: Good morning to Gábor Szõts|pg||

pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SQ8653HA9762D8CJ5,SJT4HQ53DKQ4CQ932,S972HKJT8D73CKT74,SAKH4DAJT9652CA86|sv|n|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: So pls shut down and connect|pg||
nt|Walddk1: The two tables are not connected|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|shevek: hi hans, vladimir, everyone :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls enter the result Thierry, 4HE-1|pg||
nt|gohar: 3nt was better?.....isnt it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no it isnt|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not really |pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @d lead and u are out|pg||
nt|gohar: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you should try to win the matches versus the strong teams in the round robin, because those results count later in the final|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
nt|dimi: at the other table Baldursson-Jonsson is facing Pikarek-Smirnov|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
nt|dimi: Wladow-Elinescu play a strong @c-system with strong NT |pg||
nt|Gerben42: Baldursson - Jonsson were part of the 1991 Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems light at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running scores|pg||
nt|haans: TG CC say Flannery :)|pg||
nt|dimi: Magnusson-Haraldsson play 2/1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: iceland here is playing a variable no trump range and transfer bid over a 1 cl opening|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 11th trick needs to come from @C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he avoid 2 club looser?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
nt|gohar: they deserve penality|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: given the 5-5 distribution he can play Ace and low @C!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
nt|hedyg: went down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1 sek brb|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To bid ANYTHING with the West-hand is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just ducked the @c and let E ruff and make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H seems to be makeable and that is 620, lets see|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 4@h should have been won|pg||
nt|hedyg: ducking the @c lead he loses 1@c 1ruff and 1@s|pg||
nt|gohar: yes @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: down 3 ...|pg||
nt|gohar: 4@h better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even going up then draw 2@d 2@h ruff a @d and 10 trick's|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d9|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
nt|gohar: what abt the other table?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu can then drop the @CJ under the A|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: elimination of spades and hearts and then the queen of cl|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|xenya: i don't believe that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice defence |pg||

nt|janhamhurg: now the 9 and later the queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can play the 2, Wladow will be in an endplay|pg||

nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||

nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||

nt|hedyg: he played K@H on the switch!|pg||

mb|1S|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||
nt|hedyg: why useless? good for 7NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy 4 h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||

nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c rkc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy dia lead, quick claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 3 is positive|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: notice that Jonsson did not bid after 1@D, almost making it impossible for Smirnov Piekarek to go plus (even 5@D will be hard to make without information)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||

nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hat to tell you, but 7 @S is ONLY 2.000 = gaining 5 IMP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@s?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||

nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think he should have bid 4@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||

nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know theyre system but must be void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tuff start at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H he can claim|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's say 1NT = 12-14.  Then he has probably found @DAK and the @SA.  That means North will have one of the @H/@C queen, but not both|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And there are extra complexities - like how does he get to dummy to play trumps?|pg||

nt|mamos: three off turned out  to be optimistic|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w may well end up in 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: Cristina Giampietro and Pony Nehmert bid 1@s 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland said that is not a record|pg||
mb|2D|nt|janhamhurg: not a good idea i thk, why not 2 dia or 1 no- because they are vulnerable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT natural with 4+ @d I believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  Italy'en team is *powning*:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: partscores are not IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
nt|mamos: id expect South to bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be to much|pg||
nt|dimi: -1 likely outcome|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Magnusson meant 2@S as purely comp.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now they play 4- probably - 1, but makes if you find the club queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but Haraldsson expected perhaps a tiny bit more than this junkyard|pg||
pc|d8|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still isnt a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now actually its better than 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good guessing in trumps helps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janhamhurg: or in clubs- but still i guess -1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  Assuming the change is minor and published to the other countries|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: declarer slipped up a little|pg||
nt|copeyj: and townsend made him pay|pg||
nt|copeyj: excellent defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done tom u just saved 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more|pg||

pc|sK|nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: althouh i don't see why it was necessary to play spades at that point|pg||
nt|copeyj: well it wasn't nice to see an error|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  this would be a minor change, it's just all the photocopying for the NPC or coach that is the hassle|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Flannery has changed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a fair overcall tho|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: operator?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: was that what happenend?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player had play the 10sp in place od cl|pg||

mb|5D|mb|d|nt|bjacobs: N/S could continue themselves, but that's unlikely|pg||

nt|vbman: my line needed 44 h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator please the contract is just made.|pg||
nt|haans: GRAND|pg||
nt|pitiful:  was that really only 9 operator?|pg||
nt|dimi: oops|pg||
nt|Gerben42: revoke?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton: yes, a chance for Sweden here|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|dimi: 2 revokes?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 12 imps away by a lack of concentration|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no revoke just the ten under the jack|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now its important to realize 15 more boards coming lots of chance|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: what misfits:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb coffee break|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for ew|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: miss click +1 sorry|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D sac optimal|pg||
mb|d|nt|copeyj: I would pass 3@C with the N hand i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: assuming this is weak jump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H equally good.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not sure what 2@S shows here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok it was a revoke then, the spade 10 on a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what is wrong with 6@C, EW.|pg||
nt|benjy:  impossible in my view|pg||
nt|eweber: I have been told these sites work best with Internet Exlorer, some browsers refuse to show anything when you click on "playing record"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||
nt|copeyj: so now I am sure Gromov will look for 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW doing what's right against pairs who mix it up like NS - just play their normal game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i dont like the 2 spade call- much to strong for me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|dimi: i agree Jan|pg||
nt|Gerben42: me too - but NS like to mix it up, it's their style|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: and play 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting that perhaps both North and South were planning a leaping michaels bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes a great lead |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 5 card stayman, so 2@D showed 1+ 4cM, 2@S showed @H and no @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: is my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||
nt|copeyj: they both are|pg||
nt|haans: will E double|pg||
nt|mamos: it is difficult to describe such hands if you open 1@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Hi Mike and Rashed|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down?????????|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1 off?|pg||

nt|shevek: 2111|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h7|nt|haans: soon maybe a game?|pg||

nt|copeyj: looks like 10 to me|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: you can make 3 spades or even 4 with a little def mistake|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: yes, it's down on good defence -- no entry to dummy tio cash high club in time|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|haans: easy defense now|pg||
nt|haans: easy?????????????|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is very delicate for declarer.  He can draw two round of trumps and ruff two clubs in dummy.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect at least 2 missed slams for any team in 20 boards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: or spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: about 1 third of all imps say be payed in defense|pg||

nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: actually declarer can't come to hand|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|andersk: Iceland is currently outbidding Norway(or the Norwegians outbidding themselves) On their way to 3 NT in open room|pg||
nt|eweber: and Sally and Nicola did well to push them to 5 by bidding 5@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: claim 11|pg||

nt|cicus: I am told 1@C includes weak club hands too|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4s other room the declarer slightly mistimes his play-with paucity of entires he shd hv played a dia when in with the first h ruff|pg||
nt|psridhar: and defense capitalised by ducking the spd king|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would fear that ops cash 5 heart tricks first, when I bid 3NT with T632. but then again Smirnov failed to open 2@D Multi or 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: with just one entry in h ace, Smirnov shd hv removed it to 4s; 3nt seems hopeless|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Hop Suisse|pg||

nt|copeyj: 1@S-2@C-2@D-2N-4N all pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: carbon copy auctions are very rare|pg||
nt|paulg:  I've only played against Fredin a couple of times, but he is one of the more imaginative that I've seen|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: i went through the play - wasnt that clear to guess it - but he made it :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4@S bid opposite the vuln preempt showed good judgement|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and trust!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unfortunately @CAKQ was opposite the singleton and break 5-2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: still makes 10 trick ace of dia is well|pg||

pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ive been looking at scores instead of bridge :(    sorry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  Townsend, who used to be known as 'Young Tom' at my local club, has become more conservative with age|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: starting with overruffing and play dia woul help- but decl didnt know 4-1 spades|pg||

nt|andersk: jeez....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in the end they accepted that it was a draw|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand:)|pg||
nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: second excellent board from piekarek-smirnov|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||

nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i dont want a @c lead!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with passed pd, another "weak jump overcall", agree with 2@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D over 1@C is annoying for opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@H fit jump even more so|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and go down in 4 spade- but now 4 dia will make |pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@D makes after a Club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player in discussion|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D looks like final contract now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no alert i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: although it may be "general bridge logic" to bid 3@H only with fit, I still think one should alert it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 3 hearts is a fit jump east might bid 3 spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||

nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 hearts now- any extras you see in that hand?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||

nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: has pros and cons i admit.... passing or bidding|pg||

nt|hedyg: only 26 of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west probably backs in if u pass but unlikely they have a game and more likely u get into trouble bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: not much point in winning either :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@ds and 1@h is enough|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: 11 toptricks - time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Sweden :)|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally and Nicola have won 12 Imps by pushing Cristina and Pony to 5 in board 6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Please tell how 2@H made 9 tricks on board 8|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Down 1 much more likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no sorry|pg||
nt|jallerton: North did well to make it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)or 1@d and 2@h|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|haans: trash may end you in 4-3 instead of 5-3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  That was why I recommended to play at least a RED suit from dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: the point has been mentioned|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cicus: pass seems a bit too little|pg||

mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|tomi2: now he leaves his opps the room to investigate evetyting. He probably had fear to push them directly into a making slam by bidding 5@D|pg||

nt|haans: :( :(|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|xenya: result on 8 corrected -- what about board 2?|pg||
nt|jfaria: I wonder what italians are doing vs Slovakia :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  helping?*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: delay after W bid NE at other side of screen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another routine 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: none, as it happens|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another potential strong @C for dubinin|pg||
nt|jfaria: again strong bal 1@c|pg||
nt|haans: 7@S?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 7@s Very optimistic|pg||
nt|haans: agree but (swede)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far EW here can be very happy with their card|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: I hate singleton K and Q - but still I would open 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: with the !K in her hand known after playing the Q earlier, @c K was the best she could try|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is were S should bid 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: probably EW will try 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@D negative from Gromov i expect|pg||
nt|copeyj: on board 10 (just played)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: England are playing 3@H undoubled in the open room|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 down|pg||
nt|jfaria: "4@s whatever u got"|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and 9 imps to England (much needed)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: 1@d = nat ALWAYS unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: 6@d anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: i like it|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: disciplined partnerships mahy handle it|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 AND NO PLAY FOR 3n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: Non Ace@C lead makes 4@S.|pg||
nt|copeyj: combined 24 i think mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 17 opp 7 isnt it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 24 i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure why 1@S alerted.  Card suggests 1@S is nat, <GF|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gold is not passing this, just considering best way forward|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has bid 4@s opposite that|pg||
mb|4S|nt|shevek: I wonder why south didn't cue @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: hearts|pg||
nt|haans: 5-6?|pg||
nt|haans: what did 21Hx show?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wont make with a normal dia lead, unless you guess the spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||
nt|eweber: y, there you are right, but who would seeing a doubleton in dummy and the chance to overruff in @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 3@d should set the trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: now here is a hand i specialise in|pg||
nt|copeyj: playing in 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c in the German system askes for 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess Dubinin draw the big picture and respected captaincy|pg||
nt|paulg:  second double would normally be a strongish takeout|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d shows a doubleton @h?|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@d say no|pg||
nt|ludewig: 4@S needs to play Spades for no losers|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shevek: they seem to get there anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: slam rates to go down though -- on the surface|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @c lead declarer has to guess @ss|pg||
nt|haans: 5@c AND WAIT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norge slapp unna en katastrofe i det andre rommet.Boye doblet 4 hj og islendingene rettet til 4sp|pg||
nt|rodvenn: fortsatt spill 8|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S could be 3 @S|pg||
nt|ludewig: North will proabably try to punch dummy with diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  the redouble said 'bid your suit'|pg||
nt|jallerton: Oh sorry I am asleep|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a method close to my heart|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
nt|eweber: if I remember correctly and they still play like this|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he is playing for 0 losers needs to start with @SQ|pg||
nt|ludewig: now he wishes he had played 3 NT|pg||
nt|dimi: true, he playing for @s 10 doubleton ...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: which is the wrong percentage play- to be honest gerben|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SQ wins whenever KT onside or T singleton behind|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42: but he doesnt know about @H yet|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jallerton: has to run this, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: IMPs right i assume|pg||
nt|paulg:  as happened to Scotland's women in the previous match, bidding a thin grand slam when the opposition are only in game is not a winning formula|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so wasnt clear to go for 0 losers in @S|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|haans: ot is double unlucky|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and loses to kx onside and kxx|pg||
mc|9|nt|andersk: as I predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: @c had to be 2-2, so @S J quite safe|pg||

nt|paulg:  is this going to be a match of two halves?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Sorry-connection problem.|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so you compare kx onside with 10x offside- thats about 50 50|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
nt|ludewig: try and make|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but the essential point is that you dont knwo your @S goal without knowing if you lose @HK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so is my grade in german:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
nt|dimi: no road to fail|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1o tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but germany is far behind now in the match, and i woudnt call that unlucky|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jfaria: next pl|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||
pc|d8|nt|copeyj: 8 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: Play right???????|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andersk: cant raise 8 tricks thats the problem|pg||
nt|pauleger: this line succeeds as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: yuip a very unluicky board for england|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aggressive play could be a vital asset of the world's greatest bridge players. many believed to attack in a bold, confident, and determined way, who knows they thing to make a ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giant leap toward realizing their full potential |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: number 10 still to come- which is a sure --|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Could be 1000 or even 1400 to Germany|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: 5@C is quite awkward on a @D lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes it's eerily like board 10|pg||

nt|rnmalik: But you had given up:)|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 10 was not passed in as we thought|pg||
nt|haans: SW other side of screen|pg||
nt|mamos: all these players have lots of medals and championships to their names|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is he's fault|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 6 club is better, but since 2 keycard are missing 6 isnt an option i thk|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H is lay-down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 sp is -1 only|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or - 2 if a ruff comes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be 9 trick's unleass he guess the @h Q|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry always -2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bidding clubs 3 times is a miracle to me- sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
nt|ludewig: South shows some club support, he did not bid 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a kibitz says pass over 4 spade would have been forcing- im not so sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CX+1 is more than slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1400 vs 1370|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that scores well no sos on level 5:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX I mean|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CXX+1 , without redouble slam is more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is north thinking? if he bids i leave:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: north and east are on 1 side - operator enters two bids at the time|pg||
nt|ludewig: the operator puts in bids for N and E at the same time, so East is thinking I think|pg||
nt|dimi: E will not feel comfortable|pg||
nt|Gerben42: East just showed support in an auction in which opps are strong |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: N is thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Dear collegue - 4 @H lay-down = 10 tricks, they will regret, that they didÂ´nr RD|pg||
nt|Gerben42: woww|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1130 against possible 1370|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be the start of a German comeback?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its not that easy- we will see|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: yeh hearts is hard work tho shouldmake|pg||
nt|haans: even today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-oh - only 600...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So "WE" get 11 IMP|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on this lead can make all tricks even... 1800|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we see 13 tricks, but imagine cl 3-1 and king of hearts offside|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
nt|dimi: One swallow does not make a summer ...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i doubt that that is an english saying----|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: update on board  10 - apparently the table result was 5@S making, but score adjusted by director to 5@H-1 ; Germany can appeal until 30 minutes after end of match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: reason for adjustment was a break in tempo (BIT) from Elinescu|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: nicely bid and with @S 3/3 makes.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 if Fallenius gets @Cs right -- more if he doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: he does 50% of time :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: now a promotion?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: so much for laydown|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the play did seem irregular on  10 - now we know why|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now he needs cl 22 and heart 22- not sure that line was best|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|jfaria: small plus for NL|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: he does not 50% of time 2|pg||
nt|haans: is it time ti think now?|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, he might play clubs from the top, then try for some endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: very obscure, all that|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 11 Cullin bid 6@d|pg||
nt|xenya: lead?|pg||
nt|shevek: @d|pg||
nt|haans: thats why we are leading am never we if they are losing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible, really Jansma played @d7?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: so a nice pick-up for Sweden|pg||
nt|pauleger: he may now try the @c finesse and go down|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jfaria: EW going down increases the gain|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: home now- but nothing to write home about:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing safe for +1000|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks close cicus|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: from Jonsson's pt of view his pd has shown a single suitor o/c with xtras...hence that 3s with an ace and a side singleton|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, reasonable bidding.  But 3@S is no picnic|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|cicus: it seems to me it takes a trump lead to create problems, otherwise NS can crossruff the hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Maybe 3@S IS a picnic.  Losing 1@D, 2@S, 1@C (ruffing the losing diamond|pg||

nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry for miscounting, 1130 was never in question, but 930 by playing @C earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: should have said "safe" rather than safe |pg||
mb|d!|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hard to reach a club contract- weired x here, their style i thk to x with 15 +|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: oh i see:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
pc|sT|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
nt|dimi: doctores are not that brave today|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|eweber: good defense against a making 3@d contract :)|pg||
nt|mamos: must take diamonds now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||

nt|haans: i hope we doubled 7@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 14 comes later  sorry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: -200 can not be more exiting|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: om 14 they play 4 sp / player to fast |pg||
nt|haans: fair|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 14 / 4sp = ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  that will be 4 imps to Sweden then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange to play 3 @D - with that @S-fit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a freak coming here!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: whoa|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|5H!|nt|shevek: yes, once the team mates sit the same way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly but lead was good. Kept E thinking.|pg||
nt|jfaria: not ver exciting hands... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: either all pass or Fucik opens|pg||
nt|haans: 14 4@S a make|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR 2@H showed @H +m and 3@c was pass or correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: not strange at all really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Same her, I suppose|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 2@h it should be normal to|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that looks as someone has made it up to produce a big swing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 3 imps if 4@s made exactly|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes here also 2@H= 5@H +4m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ?!|pg||
mb|6D!|nt|pelu: transfer to @S (4+) could have a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South likely to bid 2@S - unless 3@D would be a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the hand is a bit weak for that action|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just trying to help Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: 5 Imps for GER in board 10, Sally bid 2NT vs this wk2 on @h 10xxxxxx, ending up in 3@sX for 800|pg||
nt|mamos: id guess that germany are winning the match at the moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asks|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: South undeterred.... |pg||
nt|andyv:  good call, Mike|pg||
nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing @S or @C and @D I guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||
nt|paulg:  but that is probably why I'm commentating|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: half way!|pg||
nt|shevek: anyway, past midnight here, work tomorrow :(|pg||
nt|shevek: have fun everyone|pg||
nt|haans: jump to game with minimim hand|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks and I'll find out the REAL score tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: showing 5 spades i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   leb?|pg||
nt|lestergold: leb?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D = pass with minors, bid 6@S otherwise|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: Bye Nicoleat seen you again|pg||
nt|shevek: bye now|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Hans and Vladimir|pg||
nt|haans: Nicoleta|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Nicoleta, thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would 2 @S mean after 2 @H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all makes sense now, in a crazy way|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great lead!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad timing for the agressive move by W|pg||
nt|ludewig: over 1@S from S nobody would bid less than 4 or maybe 5NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: psychologically +1000 +800 will do the Germans well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but its hard to stop below 5 clubs- so the gain might be just 300|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in std system the auction might go: 1@S (2NT) pass (3@D) ; 3@H (4@C) Dbl end|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: not with 7-6 gerben!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bidding 4@C voluntarily on this auction surely shows my hand with pd promising nothing|pg||
nt|ludewig: the other table is in 5D with S to bid (after 1Club - 4NT)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a spade is best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: might be - 5 now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is a trap for all EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all clear now- so he will play a dia|pg||
nt|ludewig: same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp. after strong @C from S, West will be motivated to push higher|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far scores on  15 range from 1100 NS to 1700 EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: perfect defence will give germany some needed imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: make that +2200 to -1700|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@Dxx -5 until 6@Sx-6|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||
nt|paulg:  is this layout almost pre-destined?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: probably|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: do not balance in long in their suit = p have no points|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42: hope no one will have nightmares about this one - good thing it's in the morning session|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: now!!|pg||
nt|jallerton: well I suppose if anyone has an 8-card spade fit it's probably oppo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: a lot off|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  unless they have already bid yours|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|haans: here we see what who good it was to lead a further spade|pg||
nt|ludewig: anyway perfect defense from NS here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes - 1400 will do both their confidence and their score some good|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: very careless line|pg||
nt|lestergold: club now for maxi|pg||
nt|lestergold: is that not obvious?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already off two bad result|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that and prev board could be a break point - in case OR find and makes 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: wrong Jack|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: truly well played |pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: i would be disappointed at that 800 as NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing that South would have been better off playing a trump at trick 3, but that's not an obvious play|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: that wafer thin overcall is abt to get the treatment here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Run to 2@H?|pg||
nt|cicus: I never understood the concept of overcalling on very weak hands|pg||
nt|cicus: you only give away information without hope of gaining anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For the lead, make life hard for opps - there are several reasons|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Assume they will run to 2@H the slow way|pg||
nt|psridhar: XX rather than 2h is in the hope that pd can run to 2c|pg||
nt|cicus: make life hard with 1@S when the have the balance of power?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|cicus: *they|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly - I wouldn't be surprised to Iceland pick up imps on this deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: his wish is granted now play 2c x on 3-3?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He redoubles|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|psridhar: wd now 2h 'escape'|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: OK, now somehow he has to scramble 5 tricks to justify my comments about winning imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Bill is accurate in his prediction as always :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I will believe you Bill even if he won't|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: trumps Piekarek..trumps and more trumps pl..|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tomi2: E has no entry to play one more heart|pg||
nt|cicus: my feeling is that E may have confused matters by passing over 1@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not totally championing the 1@S overcall, but it had two things in its favour: the good suit and the vulnerability|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And I agree with you that East's pass was very strange indeed|pg||
nt|psridhar: acc to gib if smirnov plays a pointed suit now 2h x makes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: cold slam|pg||
nt|jfaria: OK a good strugle now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have saved a trick drawing a trump at the end|pg||
nt|ady: grand here|pg||
nt|ady: but on heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sweden are recovering at a pace that could lead to a win|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||
nt|mamos: not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mamos: shed have preferred oppo to open 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland in it therefore|pg||
nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: reward for a most quiet auction goes to Jansma - Paulissen|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
nt|dimi: 12 imps, nice |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S (2NT) p (p); 3@H (4@C) X end - 300|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||

nt|eweber: it is a pleasure to watch this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||
nt|copeyj: X from Townsend showing 4+@H|pg||

nt|ady: twins got into bother on jand 15   plaued 4@HX    losy 500 and 7 imps|pg||

mb|3S|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a huge hand for 10-12 NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: England are hurting|pg||
nt|lestergold: regret that i must leave now thx to my excellent fellow commentators well played Denmark|pg||

nt|Gerben42: invitational jump shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||
nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3NT seems to have a shot though|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||
nt|jfaria: he can now|pg||
nt|haans: a Gazzilli variation |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|dimi: not the best lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: now they can play nt|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: sorry, I must leave too - I have a bridge match|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so Iceland got to Lightner double 6! played from West. 1 down|pg||

nt|mdgraham: thanks Simon, thanks operator - and well done to Denmark|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: @CJ right|pg||
nt|andersk: and Norway stoped in 5@S on the next slam, as we predicted|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is a funeral|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course also very well done by Iceland!|pg||
nt|andersk: we still miss board 13 here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: agree, seems unlikely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: makes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  almost looks like one round of bidding is missing|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend trying for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: my kind a play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: maybe South bid 3NT and North corrected?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|haans: well done|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its very close though, for example @CA onside would suffice|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@hs and a @s trick as a minimum|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: 4-0 break of course not helpful|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jallerton: Perhaps 4@s is Flint here, trying to sign off somewhere|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jfaria: now Fuck can ruff some @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@d|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fucik worked for that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  hard to know what range East has actually shown |pg||
nt|jallerton: they were not many IMPs at stake anyway, Hans assuming EW made a plus score|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|haans: nice knowing who has the king|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-Board 15, 4@H was made.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vasmar: Purka yo mean|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: I suspect West was just signing off in 5@d, Paul|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pauleGER: not "well done" ? ME: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|pg||
nt|mamos: still ok if plays Heart when in with Club|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: you are a regular commentator and we are sure that a nice personality there :)|pg||
nt|haans: now @H finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|jfaria: Fucik i meant|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true Gunther is declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: but will be 2 down eventually|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: oh dear Towsened has abandoned 2 clubs and the enry form a spade finesse|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pauleger: -2|pg||
nt|vasmar: he will make easily 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodvenn: thanks i must leave|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen had better hold the Ace @s |pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u opps will be endplayed at some point|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 4/2 heart break was quite a normal xpectation so im nor convinced by towsned's timing here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|d2|nt|haans: talk again|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: nice defense|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  this defense a bit surreal|pg||
nt|pelu: and the play :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  one more board but time for me to go to bed... good night everyone and enjoy the rest of the show!|pg||
nt|jfaria: but that we all can see looking at 4 hands :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: however doesn't affect the lesson:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so +1 |pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: night Andy|pg||
nt|mamos: oops |pg||
nt|eweber: misguessed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still I think you need to be in such games - unless you can really figure out @H 3-3|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: somehow i don't believe he made 10|pg||
nt|pelu: lets guess: 8 tricks ?|pg||
nt|haans: OpenCC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||

nt|bjacobs: Because this must be a (bad) dream|pg||

mb|4S|nt|tomi2: it is morgning, yes :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cicus: but morning sessions are the worst|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just the lazy 9 card suit ... what is East to do?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Devil of a problem - we all see that a grand slam is on a heart guess, but Piekarek doesn't know that|pg||
nt|tomi2: difficult, he has bid a weak hand with hearts already and has 2 ourside kings|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely not defend 4s when he can make 7h?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: i hear iceland has reach 7H other room|pg||
nt|psridhar: doubled of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: of course?|pg||
nt|cicus: normal play in @Hs slightly favors the drop but bidding may alter probabilities|pg||
nt|psridhar: sitting with the trump king over the long h bidder|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: I think they need to call the auditors in on the hand dealing program|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: the traditional trump lead in grand might persuade E to put up the ace-did he find it in other room?|pg||
mc|12|nt|bjacobs: We'll soon find out|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think if South doubled 7@H, it gives everything away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact it was North, which didn't give everything away |pg||
nt|cicus: but his bidding did|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess you are right ... what an amazing hand to finish on|pg||

nt|hedyg: good afternoon and welcome back to the 50th European Team Championships, Ostend, Belgium. Seniors RR 2 , 20 boards/round|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hello Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome to Stefano Franchino, Andreas Plejdrup Meister, Mirza Gohar Mahmood and Hans Werge  |pg||
nt|gohar: hi hedyg|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: ok whatever|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no shortness in exctiing boards|pg||
nt|Gerben42: This is the last board of the match! Many thanks to our excellent operator Thierry Mullens and my co-commentators :)|pg||
nt|dimi: in board 17, piekarek-smirnov reached 4@s and made for +6 imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: stay tuned for more top bridge from Oostende the rest of the weak|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|lestergold: no|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: how many @H, 4@H for me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: thank you i do me best|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: next sessions 13.00 16.15 central time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks.|pg||
mb|5N|nt|xenya: last hand now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4cards M ?|pg||
nt|jfaria: last hand, thanks to my fellow commentators, and all the super kibs we got :) operator was great too |pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende.  Great concentration!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H is a nice contract, can even find @HK after overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been 2NT opening?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: East had a  horrid position   - played South for Kx  which in a way was consistent with her defence  dont know what 1@H from North meant|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably expected south to have more than 10points for 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 22/18|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentators: Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||
nt|eweber: though she might have expected North to have something for her 1@h bid|pg||
nt|mamos: these handa re glaringly obvious for us .......... but declarer has a different view :)|pg||
nt|eweber: they are playing very quickly, maybe too quick this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  n-s have a @s partcore here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s could be a cheap defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: strange |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but found the top spot anyway|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rnmalik: Board 17 may result in double swing for Sweden.|pg||
nt|haans: or it may not :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max flat.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but e-w would push on to 3@d|pg||
mb|7H|nt|h_karluk: wonder who will try to balance it out|pg||
nt|Gerben42: wow @@6@S and 7@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: that will make!|pg||
nt|dimi: 7@s is 3 down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: sure is an exciting match|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h ?:) hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: tanks to watch|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume she relied on the fact that Dany never played a @h through|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: last 5 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps had 3 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a normal comntract to bid but looks doomed on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and after last h goes to table|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree hamid all very strange|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|benjy:  Thanks all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks everyone, hope to see you tomorrow morning for the battle of two teams no longer in the World Cup ... Scotland vs France|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: this only possible very fast players there, also in a long marathon operators got tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a savage misfit in the side suits and a nasty spade layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Me (and some spec.s - thanks) think defence took 2@H and 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we all think that Robin|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes some time to fqst|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last hand.  Thanks to the operator Thierry Mullens in Ostende and to Hamid, Mike, David and Simon; and to Roland and EBL for organising the broadcast|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|lestergold: well movie shows it as making need to check more carefully|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We appreciate to Eurepean Bridge org, Mr Thierry Mullens of Belgium was our successful operator, to the BBO, to Roland Wald of Denmark and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *European|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: thank you all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yw|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it shows townsedn claimning 8 tricks acceppted after he had 6 and onoly the one more to come as we all observed so it remains a mystery|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think either Fucik did an exception or changed his ideas abt LTC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: @SQ just a joke|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: hand 19   CR was played in 3@S  making 100|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Sweden got 15 imps on Board 17, 5@Hx making.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: tricky double, will Haraldsson now misplay trumps?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: stay tuned!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jfaria: somedays 3@h could be right , not now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pauleger: he will make his contract. thx all for watching, thx Rashed and we will be back @@ 13:00 local time with R5 of the RR|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well done!|pg||
nt|dimi: well done Iceland, thx all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: now its a question of damage limitation contract likely to be same in open |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: now has 3 @H losers and @D and @C.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were nothing to do with the @h guess|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: might be too late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each IMPs vital|pg||
nt|paulg:  an important win for England, and i guess it will be 20-10 or 21-9 VPs?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anders tells me that it will be 21-9 VPs|pg||
mc|13|nt|paulg:  for a 27 imps win ... thanks all|pg||
