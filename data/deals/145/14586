nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hello Peter, Gerben, Ugis and Barnet|pg||
nt|ugis: Latvians playing Precision here and Polish club in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: An untidy contract to reach|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C must have been some art. rebid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|ugis: yes, 2c artificial here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Welcome Barnet :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so looks like a Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42: (opps have more trumps than declarer)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card is http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/latvia/Ozols-Romanovskis.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably not much lost as natural bidders would reach 3@C, which has problems on this trump break|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||

nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||

nt|iain sime: Hi everyone. Both pairs are using fairly natural methods. For Italy 2@Dis strong, for the Swiss it is a weak 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As is Ostend :) Hey Iain|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hello Shirley, Bill and Mike|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||

nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2@C overcall has helped them to stop low on good values.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Even hot in Edinburgh!|pg||

nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do quite well in diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, Duboin can tell that South will not hold the @SK as well as the values shown. Otherwise he would have responded. A text-book example of reading the cards. Well done.|pg||

nt|mbruun: Hey|pg||
nt|henryb:  slovakia just scored on Italy|pg||
nt|xenya: first blood to Italy -- in the OR 4@H was declared by S|pg||
nt|brolucius: But, er... I'm sure Duboin would also have made it, had he been declarer. |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR S showed both M over opening 1@C bid and NS bid the @H game for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|pasker: Bocchi and Madala bid to 5@D in the open room|pg||
nt|pasker: which went one down|pg||
nt|mamos: NS appear to have a comfortable game here|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass????|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S likely contract but cards not well placed for declarer|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D negative, then Sementa no doubt with some 2-suiter|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7 HCP|nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|1H|nt|atabey: board 1 was a push. after a 1@s opening|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D opening by EW, would show a strongish balanced hand.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand for N/S ... actually 6@C is a good contract, but it might not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a web site for these trials? |pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 D on a clubfinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: or this tourney |pg||
nt|hedyg: Piper showing a lot of respect for the 7-4 hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asked me to tell him when anything would happen Henry|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@h looks best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the opens I think Austria beat England if I am not mistaken |pg||
nt|iain sime: South has judged he is too light for a Michaels cue bid at red.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|hedyg: 18-19 balanced yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: unfortunatley Scotland do not have a team in South Africa|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He's not looking too pleased|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: yes. Boye transferred first to spades and then bid hearts|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt might be better|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Vugraphznk: I wouldn't consider it with Jxx and Qxxx M anyway, even if I could open weak 2, would you?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running EC scores, courtesy of Roland Wald|pg||
nt|hedyg: what has W judged?|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d has some play here|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N certainly has more chance of success|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine there being a banner on www.eurobridge.org|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how many times can you pass with 10 hcps opposite an opening?|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3NT would have made in practice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: both hands 4333... should be in 3N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphznk: NS seem to be a tad agitated...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 9 tricks not imemdiately visible|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and nothing to play for in the red suits .. so see this drifting -1|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Hey David, Roland :) Welcome all!|pg||
nt|jtr: Gazzilli auction here|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoi Bas|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like a normal 3rd seat 1 @d opening to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Bas |pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C puppet stayman?|pg||
nt|sybarra: those are the sites I have  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C drury? apparently not, judging by the 3H call|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H overcall might encourage South with well placed AJx to try 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 3@DX corrected to 3@HX is hard to analyse, if South went for blood|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|lesniak: celne zachowanie gracza E|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|iain sime: As it happens 5@D loses two clubs and a heart. |pg||

pc|c2|nt|jtr: I have noticed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Life was not meant to be easy...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has no choice anyhow|pg||

pc|c8|nt|bagman: Sure he had, diamond to Q and spade finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d???? and get ruffed?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy bid and made 4@H (+1) on the first board, for 11 IMPs.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: especially with Sementa declaring - he will get very trick out of his awkward contract|pg||

nt|sybarra: can it be weak multi also?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, just a BAL hand just under 2NT opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am sure Duboin would swap 21-0 for 0-21 if it gave the Azzurri a late equalizer in yesterday's game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure, but he had an option and there was this restricted choice thing in spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  the old Precision 2@d opener|pg||

nt|sharkey: the Vienna system which may still be used by some had 7-5-3-1 count David - 68 points in the deck|pg||
nt|hedyg: David are you implying that Lohay should have ruffed with the jack?|pg||
nt|brolucius: J-10, J-9 or 10-9 is three times more likely than J-10-9 (instead of the normal twice as likely).|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: But cashing out is probably better in Teams|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: doesnt even need it as cards lie. could just cash winners and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||

nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||

pc|h3|nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||

nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||

nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||

nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7 HCP|nt|petergill: No need to introduce the Italians, who earlier this year were ranked 2nd, 18th, 13th and 187th in the WBF world rankings|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||

nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have a Bocchi0Duboin convention card up and 1@S shows diamonds for that partnership. Cannot find one for this partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
nt|stc: the two black Q's in S will probably score|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
nt|barnets: the 12 imps Iatvia gained is when after a natural 2N - North Bocchi looked for a major fit with 4-3-3-3 found one and went down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told this gives the scores:  for running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|iain sime: Meanwhile, East has done too much opposite a balancing double I think. Oh, and come on Germany!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking probably not a winner but Madala is unaware of the bad splits|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, North opened 1@S, East passed (sensible and disciplined) and Madala as South has responded 1NT, which could lead to a @D partscore, I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the maximum for an Italian 1@S is quite high, still not passing was a position|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Sementa's smart duck of @DK might reap a good dividend|pg||
pc|dK|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|jtr: Is there one for group B ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt ok for me..|pg||
nt|brolucius: That says it all. Englishmen want Murray to do well at Wimbledon. Scots want England to lose to Germany. Sad!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No matches at Wimbledon today I hear, that solves one problem|pg||
nt|stc: just switch some of those Q's|pg||
nt|iain sime: It will mean that we will be able to watch the rest of the tournament without being bombarded with references to 1966 for a start.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: and they play Gazilli, so 2@D is not reachable|pg||

pc|c5|nt|petergill: so they have stopped in 3@D, which looks makeable|pg||

nt|othered1: 1N is just the price you pay for inverted minors.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Versace are in 4@S on board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||
nt|lesniak: lepiej bylo z karta adama otw 1 trefl i stanac w 1-2 pik:(:(|pg||
nt|bagman: Here 2M might be considered overbidding|pg||
nt|iain sime: "three was too high partner"|pg||

nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: first u have to bid it, then they have to lead a nonclub|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding on the last deal was instructive. When you compete for a part-score, responder should be very wary of undoing your good work by going too high.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really if he counted N's hcps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1-point upgrade|pg||
nt|barnets: count one point for good clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin and Sementa are among the very best card players in the world - the best, according to some people (especially from Italy). |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 20.05 HCP, according to Kand R Evaluator at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq2+k64+k6+ak986|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||

nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Tez|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: and so THEN the breaks are good and he will make it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
nt|bagman: N is likely to lead a heart whether W bids hearts or not; just for a different reason|pg||
nt|lesniak: 3 pik=krotkosc- ale nie jestem pewien czy obaj tak mysla|pg||

nt|petergill: North cannot be accused of lack of courage!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess OK with @D3-3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no insurance taken out|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid by charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure Madala's approach was right tactically|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||

nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||

nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should survive.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H also makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: must get @hs right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, very fortunate.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible to go wrong, really|pg||
nt|stc: very good decision by Mossop|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: nice lead|pg||

nt|lesniak: chyba ze czegos nie zauwazylem|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||

nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D ruff for 800|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
nt|petergill: East is endplayed after he ruffs the @D and has to accept 800 instead of 1100  - he will try a low club from his king |pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Norberto Bocchi did not bid as boldly as Janis Ozols|pg||
nt|barnets: nice play|pg||
nt|barnets: gives north a dilemma|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin, anticipating the endplay, works out that it's better to play a club from his side than to give partner the @d ruff. Classy, as long as it doesn't backfire.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats impressive bridging|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: I think it was better to pitch a @D there, not a spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: 4 card majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 6 Swiss in 5@c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H over 2@H would show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
nt|snetram:  co powinno pokazywaÄ renons|pg||

nt|stc: and, as in the case of Madala you may play for different countries|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there's a lack of entries to dummy|pg||

nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Piper knows that North will probably hold a couple of diamonds, as he did not use the 2@H opener (three suits, short in diamonds)|pg||
nt|capercliff: cu Henry, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Awww Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Henry, enjoy :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper/Wilkinson have an excellent attitude and memories like goldfish ... a bad score never fazes them|pg||
nt|bagman: ducking twice is fatal|pg||
nt|bagman: Time to count decarer's tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  his choices would appear limited... either a club or a club or a club|pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing to do if partner hasn't go a trump trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can measure the strength of a bridge player by counting the countries in the world that would welcome the player into their national team.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@h and, if necessary, bid 2@H again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: but what is important: after 2/1, 3 level new suit better be 5|pg||
nt|lesniak: na 100% pytanie tylko czy pokazuje renons czy tez pyta o asy z wylaczeniem|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||

nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the description of the play siuggests a NT contract, probably N bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was the right board, I just entered the wrong contract, my apologies|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Muppet Stayman at the other table|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play diamonds before spades, hoping to set up a spade discard on the @DK-Q.|pg||
nt|antoniz: tam na szczêcie te¿ nie umieli zagraæ szlema,farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|bagman: In pressure situation "passion rules reason"|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|hedyg: X= good hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I never play Forcing Pass when we've jumped to a weak game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S=7+hcp, 4+@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm did he duck the 2nd @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I asked him after the claim and he said 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if he claims 9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, he took @DK and heaved a sigh of relief|pg||
nt|rodvenn: splintr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mini-splinter, shows diamond support|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and denies 4 hearts|pg||

nt|lesniak: jesli partner ma 4 ta 10 ke to jest bez znaczenia|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky 4@S here|pg||
nt|gohar: not tricky|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D might just shut out the spades.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: they need to avoid 3NT on this deal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess 5@D will be reached soon|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have (reasonably) ducked the 2nd @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NS may defend in 5@d|pg||
nt|iain sime: May not find spades if North bounces.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But 2@D seems right on those values, with the dubious heart honours.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@ds, 4@s and 1@c|pg||
nt|capercliff: playing the K was bound for going off if they were not breaking, ducking was the safety play|pg||

nt|pasker: N may now bid 3@D and S can locate the potential @S weakness|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some would bid 3@H, a mini-splinter (which would give South much more information).|pg||
nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Teehee|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D plays better than 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: not so safe|pg||
nt|barnets: with bad club break|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until we see 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suffered the connection problems that I mentioned 45 minutes ago. Obviously the exorbitant £17.99 that I pay for Boardband each month is not considered sufficient for a good ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: service.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know for sure that had N bid 3@s, S would have raised to 4, playing the principle of 5-8|pg||
nt|jtr: Entries to play @ss are a problem here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, experience and probability are neighbours, aren't they? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: no|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N try to sneak a @h now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, just like u and me! |pg||
nt|andyv:  for running scores|pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: this rates to be down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllllll famous last words|pg||
nt|petergill: South needs to retain his @D entry to the long spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it was a part of the Romex system, designed by Mexican top player George Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract same lead in the open|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did consider rising with the @SA... for about 0.0001 milliseconds.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely played by Bocchi|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for a @H stopper|pg||
nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
nt|petergill: Moment of truth|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iain sime: Not sure about this line. the heart king was an entry.|pg||
nt|petergill: Very difficult play for South|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: I guess that this will played to the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Versace had somehow found a way to duck the @d, it would have put a lot of pressure on N|pg||

nt|brgpro: after E has shown 3@s, he knows the @h aren't breaking....well, actually he hopes they wont break...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphznk: It seems the contract is indeed 4@S, I missed a part, sorry all|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhh ok ty Bas|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|jtr: They are playing 4@s at the other table i hear|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lesniak: i tyle by bylo...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pasker: as pointed out by spec the 9@S is going to be good enough on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Ducking would have been double dummy play; imagine partner with AJxx(x)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brgpro: that would be a quick one down, even without @h ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: hoping for some clues or helpful discards|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must be careful now in the trump suit. Yes, well played!|pg||
nt|mamos: pretty sure @H finesse is wrong now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too many @H's discards from W |pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will also test Madala|pg||
nt|petergill: Will be interesting to see what Madala does at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Very tough play - the sort of play that the champions often find|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open declarer played a @D from hand at trcik 2 better I think and madala made a fine play of ducking his K|pg||
nt|petergill: Agustin Madala ducked, I am told|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: declarer had no chance to set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: as dummy was short of entries|pg||
nt|athene: but now he is running seriously short of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even though west only has two obvious winners (@CA, trump)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 8, not 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W held his diamonds because N might have had diamond ace instead of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N still has the chance of a defensive error earlier, i.e. E failing to unl;ock spade ten from QTxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a diamond exit would see him home|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I haven't even done a slamtease yet ;)|pg||

nt|petergill: Well deserved imps to Italy |pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs are good they will always be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H raise should include 4333 10 counts. |pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: another canape sequence here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky club position|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H = "not forward-going", |pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
nt|petergill: He is a passed hand, so he knew if partner passed the Dbl that it would be OK|pg||
nt|barnets: not surprised|pg||

nt|sybarra: just not my style |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open north was content with just 1 X|pg||

nt|petergill: Duboin and Sementa might now be thinking - we might make some shaky penalty dbls if Janis Ozols bids a lot of subsequent hands|pg||

nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||

pc|h3|nt|brolucius: The kibitzer who told me those scores must be psychic then.|pg||
nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||

nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Strange, everyone says -1 but I'm sure the play went as it went...|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
nt|petergill: South had 2 losing choices, give partner a ruff and miss out on @D tricks, or takes winners. He chose the latter|pg||
nt|petergill: Half time, and Latvia are holding the mighty Italy well |pg||
nt|Gerben42: as they have done the other favorites of the group|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: By the way, specs, we have promised David not to comment on England's World Cup result last night. We rarely use the word "howler" during vugraph presentations|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||
nt|mamos: Blue Club type strong Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasted into it at other table|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict they will reach it here now|pg||
nt|stc: When E has only 6 cards the dec has not more trump|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
nt|barnets: good reason|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||
nt|snetram:  kara trzeba grac na impas|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a 13?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@H showed a real suit|pg||

nt|lesniak: nie na 2 stronne przebitki ma 12 lew|pg||
nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
nt|xenya: over the double|pg||
nt|bogier: na przebitki jest 12|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, it was a 26 IMP swing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has too many primes to pass if W raises|pg||
nt|mamos: surely now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||

nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 tricks off the top and a 6th if they don't squander their @d communications|pg||
nt|andyv:  N on lead so trot out his AK@h|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||

pc|s2|mc|8|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||

nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||

nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||

nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||

pc|s7|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||

nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||

nt|antoniz: piêkne odejcie|pg||

nt|brolucius: It will be nice to say: 'Well, yes, we did lose to Germany in the World Cup, but - against that - I enjoyed that big hand on BBO this morning.'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||

nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||

nt|iain sime: 5@D ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||

nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||

nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||

nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2suiters, no|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see why he didnt|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: can he get the pitches |pg||
pc|h3|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||

nt|andyv:  I'm not sure that W didn't put off playing the @ds until she felt right about them... the @c play makes no sense otherwise (why risk a ruff?)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha, Harfouche left for the bathroom and came back a bit later, just after the claim, so I asked "1 off" and Bocchi said "no, two". Just now Harfouche opened the screen and asked ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: for assurance :)|pg||
nt|mamos: David Price did well   here whether the Diamond Acw was favourite to be onside after the Multi   who knows   maybe he thought England were slipping behind   as indeed they were|pg||
nt|hedyg: better than 7-6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bad manner to talk with food in your mouth|pg||
nt|mbruun: Foot|pg||
nt|andy_h: Note that Lauria-Versace in the other room play ordinary weak 2M openings. This would restrict some of the hands being opened if you play a particular preempting style and it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: appears having a 6322 and a bit-below-average-suit-quality wasn't good enough for  Lauria|pg||
nt|antoniz: czêciówki na obie linie dla nas:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: As it was not my informant's fault, I will not name him.|pg||
nt|hedyg: E only has a 6-6 hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  may have to go back to the bathroom|pg||
nt|brolucius: Marc Smith tells me that two 11-counts together make a 3NT contract. Seems he is right on this deal.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - a Meckwell 3 NTer|pg||
nt|stc: almost balanced :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, this would be no consolation for a loss in this afternoon's big game.|pg||
nt|hedyg: can Madala stop?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Can double.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace only bid 2NT...|pg||
nt|stc: he will not pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then he cuebid as much as he could|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder how happy East managed to look as he gave preference to diamonds.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|atabey: its a difficult job. not what it looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Fair enough to play @SA-K here because declarer had no reason to expect only one club loser. |pg||
nt|brolucius: West is happy to bid, with two useful kings in partner's suits.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Thank you Spooky and erezz for the results in the absence of my personal scorecard :)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS more ambition in OR.. reached 3N down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: only 3 obvious losers but a lot of work to do especially with trumps 4-0|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you are the underdog, the N hand is one that you might want to play around with and open... maybe 3@d, or 1@d or even 1@h|pg||
nt|bagman: South might X the spade game|pg||
nt|bagman: he might not beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not with N passing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear preference he has|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2NT asking, 3@H possibly medium hand with @C shortness :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: I am relieved to hear that 21 points is not enough for 3NT. It certainly isn't when I am declarer.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means interesting hand (@S are fixed)|pg||
nt|bagman: If EW bid in confidence, S should not X. If it's invitational, X would be fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: North considering a pass. Yes, he has passed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill, remember to tune in for the cricket in 30 mins|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just waiting for David to send me an invitation for lunch|pg||
nt|jtr: Dont hold your breath|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Duboin stayed out of the auction, despite vulnerability.  West's action in OR bought -800, abetted by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *is|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: and Marc Smith. That could be fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: Consider yourself invited (after the world cup is over).|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: 3@S is not in any way invitational is it?  So is North allowed to bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is an underbid|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze idzie|pg||
nt|pasker: that lead should help|pg||

nt|petergill:  1 is Fulvio Fantoni, pushed up by his World Pairs win in 2002|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: the lead help|pg||
nt|bagman: Now this is more or less over. declarer has many ways for 10 tricks and some for 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala is looking around for an Undo button. 'Sorry, I don't know what happened. Obviously I meant to pass over 5@D.'|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: E has better majors|pg||
nt|stc: As I heard on BBO:"my daughter bounced my arm"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot use that excuse in Ostend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, who can say that 5@H was wrong? He could have ended up being a hero if the North and East hands were adjusted a bit.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: I still think that transfer is their defence to strong Club (which Simpson Price are not playing)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Sure North is allowed to. Whether it is wise to do so is a different matter|pg||
nt|xenya: good @D switch -- Italy is likely to pick 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand. Declarer's thinking suggests that he is trying to protect against any foul breaks which is what you want to do in case it happens|pg||
nt|bagman: The @CA is marked south|pg||
nt|bagman: So is the @SK with some confidence|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Suspect the problem is the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I play Gametry XX here, so 3@S is just stonewalling opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also Italian - they have a lot of players to pick from|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: maybe they play it over any club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to be at the crossroads soon; is he going to play on the clubs or on the hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 10@h would have been a great card to find|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||
nt|othered1: And AKxx of their likely trumps is a lot better for defense than offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think they are btw, same rings though she has it on her right hand and he on his left|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite a good count of the hand and can go for the line to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for some ping pong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N and W might just as well fold their cards|pg||
nt|stc: In the USBC trails Moss-Gittelman payed 2200 in -5xx, this one will be cheaper |pg||
nt|hedyg: in the Denmark/Israel match Denmark played this in 6@DXX for 2200...sry Roland |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Look at my flag, Hedy|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Only  2 is on England, I believe ;)|pg||

nt|mbruun: 6 Sp will be reached|pg||

nt|iain sime: Switzerland pick up 21 imps in two hands. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT fair enough, no good rebid if 1@c opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, whatever we think the odds for or against Madala's 5@H, let us not forget the fine judgement of West on the deal.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes indeed!|pg||

nt|hedyg: he got the hand out of his system by bidding 4NT|pg||

nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||

nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Italy's lead reflects very solid play|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||

nt|bagman: played for the drop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been some instructive bidding boards. Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that you should not take a gamble that is destined to lose.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= a major suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|Strong hand|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi tried to Charlsen, who stated he didn't mind. Then Hoffa asked for the screen to be closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec wisely pointed out that 12-15 is too wide as a 1NT range = very good point - that was part of the problem|pg||

nt|andy_h: According to the K&R Evaluator, West's hand comes to 12.20.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ9+Q7+KQ743+KJ10|pg||
nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = some sort of good raise to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even have time to let the strong hand play it|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: These people must've played with Joey "NEXT!" Silver :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That really shouldn't have happened.  South's discard on the second diamond MUST tell a story|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, she should discourage hearts ... maybe she did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: third hand for NS to have a little chat about....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Chat?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe shell shocked after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are they married?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 6@S was not such a wonderful slam as I thought at first. Various things could go wrong, but still pretty good.|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo nasi:)|pg||
nt|pasker: a bit of a careless claim there, not checking to see if the @HJ comes down|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s partial here|pg||
nt|stc: only 3IMP, a "push" in this match|pg||
nt|petergill: Italy has access to lots of good bidding ideas that are little known outside of Europe|pg||

nt|andy_h: So 2@C was @C's and a higher suit|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki Rysiu,ale dla mnie komentowanie w tak zacnym gronie to prawdziwy zaszczyt:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CA lead would allow declarer to discard two diamonds. |pg||
nt|hedyg: Switzerland need to limit the damage if they want to qualify|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 27 IMPs at 20 boards is 21-9|pg||

nt|petergill: 5+ @S, 4+ minor when not vul|pg||

nt|andy_h: I'm guessing 2@C = GF, balanced or natural clubs|pg||
nt|rodvenn: a good fit and many top controls but few tricks|pg||
nt|pasker: likely to @S game i think andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe not|pg||
nt|bagman: Might be a spade game on @HK lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think you are right:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 3N?|pg||
nt|iain sime: The so- called Aiberdeen double. 3 cards in each take out suit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a normal A@H lead how do you make 4@s?|pg||
nt|stc: only 7 VP behing the 9th place(Norway)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|Gerben42: surely will be denied|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably 3NT|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|antoniz: takie 1pik to szko³a Krzysia:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: studiowa³em Twoje ksi¹¿ki, bardzo starannie:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S are possible also without K@H lead, if South don't play @h but @D|pg||
nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is looking for a sacrifice somewhere, but doubles instead of 4NT in case partner prefers to pass.|pg||
nt|stc: another big point !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North will pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to find a bid..|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N defense have to try and stop dec making the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D = 18+ with @D|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 8 toppers with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Sementa will start liking his hand now|pg||
nt|petergill: North loves to bid, but 3@S seems too pushy, to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will be Sementa thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if it's N or E who is thinking?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: pass than 3@S isnt the kind of strategy on this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: either directly 3@S or forever hold your peace|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3Nt is the best spot|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Dbl 3@S Dbl All Pass might be the auction at one or two tables|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||
nt|snetram:  szlemik w karo nie jest Åatwy do licytacji|pg||
nt|antoniz: po tym 1pik chyba niemo¿liwe|pg||
nt|Gerben42: asking for stopper, Duboin has some|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: 10/19 leads so far were @C leads, that's funny|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, she gets access to dummy's clubs, but not too clear what to throw on them|pg||
nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think North should have bid 3@h on the last one, though|pg||
nt|petergill: Gerben's words are Very Important Advice|pg||
nt|petergill: the "or forever hold your peace" bit, I mean|pg||
nt|barnets: needs very good defense to beat this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is not at all hopeless|pg||
mb|d|nt|bagman: Declearer might go down a lot now unless he cashes out the 7 tops|pg||
nt|sharkey: West opened 1@H canape OR so East was out unless wanted introduce @D suit Vul...|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice double by E|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi actually bid 5@C in temp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tempo|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D sets spades as I think 4@C would be needed to confirm that 2@C was based on a natural club suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: XX showing first round control|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think|pg||

nt|andyv:  W should pass this but hard to do|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D 1@C 2@H are the easy ones|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 3n would have made|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = 3 @H's, 4@D's, one club ... and one on the wash maybe |pg||
nt|Gerben42: hmm :) what about 4@D will they dbl?|pg||
nt|petergill: but EW keep bidding, heading towards contracts which should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It does|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bagman: South has two chances to play hearts before the elimination postion develops|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes and Fantoni made a killing at a NABC tourney in the US by playing 5 3N contracts holding 5-4 major suit fits... it was right every time!|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table North did make a trump trick, of course, but declarer was able to ditch two hearts on the established @CK-Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: safe lead from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s for @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have turned a handy plus (probably) into minus.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he still had a @d loser and 1@s? how did he make 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Magic.|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like he should have lost 1@H, 1@s and 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "No bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was when Bas had written 12-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he corrected that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very poor slam; too much wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|antoniz: zwyciêstwo bardzo nas cieszy, a zaczê³o sie niespecjalnie:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: N has troubles if they play odd=encouraging on the diamond switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have few losers, but they lack tricks - 5@D on non trump leads might make 2 H's, 1 @C and 8 @D's I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is interesting too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Disgusting"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: 2@S = 19-21|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: heh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: 3NT = 5@S  4@C and not 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bro Paolo would have made 12 ? :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what can he do|pg||
nt|barnets: if he can make 5@H tricks 4@D and a club |pg||
nt|barnets: seems a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp the combination of making 5@H and getting the @D through|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @D 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: if the diamonds split|pg||
nt|petergill: The play looks complex - I hope the defence do not let Duboin's reaction affect their concentration (i.e. make them assume that the contract is hopeless)|pg||
nt|barnets: would have better chance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: On @H lead, don't you get @H pitch on @S?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: ohhhhh N didnt split his @s honours!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bogier: z " O" PC ciê¿ko cos wyci¹gn¹æ w licytacji|pg||
nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you can ruff 4@S in dummy and @D 3-2 you would get 6 or 7 @H perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict 4@h will fail and will take a very very long time to be played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he will try that I guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was taking a nap :(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably being upset about the A@c play|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not @s back?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in other news: Germany 1 - England 0|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds ok to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: I will, just after i finish sticking needles in my eyes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|stc: good play now, @s helps dec|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Good tactics psychologically to fail to split spade honours. Makes missing the game look worse. But such clever manoeuvres are better early in a match.|pg||
nt|stc: K@S the last safe exit card|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more easy to beat 4@S that 3Nt|pg||
nt|petergill: He might be hoping for @D's 3-2 and complete crossruff = 9 tricks - 10 tricks fails when @d's breaks 4-1 |pg||
nt|Gerben42: i know because I live there and suddenly outside got VERY loud |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|bagman: Bocchi leaves the @HA for his partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe the Great Dealer will end the session with a flourish. Another big deal right at the end.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: I wonder if they have saved us something splendid for the last board.|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice of him:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but when your pd showed out on @s not such great tactics ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice|pg||
nt|stc: Madala should have cashed the @hs before @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: then Mossop could play K@s|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|iain sime: Queen, spade ruff, heart, heart.|pg||
nt|stc: yes but he is endplay again, he makes only 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi's decision to bid 5@C is still a bit puzzling. It would have been interesting to know how he came to that decision. Perhaps he placed South with a better hand.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|andy_h: Concentrate Bas!|pg||
nt|bagman: N has no reason to keep the diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Pow, there went Duboin's @DK|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: To the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but I think it was the best chance|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|sharkey: and Slovakia may win the 2nd half of this match - and good luck in the football games coming up|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: South and West are screen mates|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly what Latvia wanted, a few more imps for a nice respectable result about mighty Italy|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us in a most entertaining set of boards... the bridge may not have been perfect but there was a lot of excitement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 4pik|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe Italy doesn't get 25Vps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Bas, great job as usual!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps was not sure about 4@s, natural or short ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop alerted 3@D but then took it back|pg||
nt|petergill: Latvia is still well placed to qualify, having already played Iceland, Italy, Germany and Bulgaria|pg||

nt|m_niemi: sry, priv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If we knew what that meant, we'd probably agree |pg||
nt|brolucius: If 3@H was NF at the other table, East might well have passed.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, sure, partnership bidding is the key to being successful at bridge :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How did I go?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are vulnerable so they might bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bas for the extra table-side information. (The mark of a top VG operator...)|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they reach 4@H?|pg||

nt|pasker: thanks|pg||
nt|petergill: or 5@D?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Scotland have played well in the first two days of the tournament and hopefully that will set them up for the tough days ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Transfer responses after an interference of an opening bid, hence 1@H=5+@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but a very entertaining fight!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas, Vladimir, Andy, Jon, Christian and Martin|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
nt|stc: W opened 2NT, you have 5@ss, hard to believe that partner has 5+@s and no @c fit !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure whether Zivkovic alerted 3@D, I would assume so|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they pinpoint the @S problem...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure Roland, I enjoyed it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Slovakia|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebanon v France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: They pinpointed the spade problem, as one expects from these Italians|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: playing like this they are among the big favorites|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another 4@H by EW in a 7 card fit :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: that's not the best possible start...|pg||
nt|iain sime: thanks Bas and all. Bye. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 64 minutes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Iain|pg||
pc|s4|nt|snetram:  Moim zdaniem E powinien walczyc - 4NT|pg||

pc|sK|nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andy_h: In the Open Room, the Norwegian N/S pair had an uncontested auction to 3NT after North decided to reverse with 2@H|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: still cant handle it all |pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer can get two diamonds the tricks he makes from trumps|pg||
nt|pasker: it is difficult to know when you don't know what 2m would have been over 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: In the end N might get endplayed but the contact is probably down at that time|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: ciao all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks, be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The TD's here now|pg||
nt|antoniz: a my 11 lew|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
nt|andyv:  When E denied @hs, maybe he shoudl have pulled 1N to 2@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: I had to get a hyphen in during the session just to please DB|pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't notice it. Where?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks everyone|pg||

nt|jtr: Thanks for watching everyone  TTFN|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Thank you, be back later :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: and a tie score 2nd half|pg||
nt|brolucius: A classy plus score by the Italians to end the session. |pg||
nt|bagman: It's seldom that at this level a pair stops in 3@H in an invitational sequence when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa played the "played card game" again|pg||
nt|sharkey: I understand Bas and the Dutch play Slovakia next game in football - so good luck to both teams :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D by Versace seam more effective after 1nt by Lauria|pg||
nt|pasker: W likely to make 3 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bagman: A game should be bid  if its 33% or better|pg||
