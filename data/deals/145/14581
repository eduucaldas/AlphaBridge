nt|yuval10: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?26046.0 post_26060|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa likely to pass this as S could not open|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everyone passes the s hand even with the poor @S structure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 1N all pass|pg||
nt|haans: gadgets|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did not feel for it|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're due for some interesting matches|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|rigas_karo: kalimera se olous|pg||
nt|star6ija: J@h was better continuation|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||
nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rigas_karo: +1 now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d9|nt|eweber: as I just see Russia is playing with Khiuppenen-Kholomeev in the closed room, NL with Wijs-Muller|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|aldek: you could play for @CK in north|pg||
nt|mamos: David prederving that 1D2|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes interesting. No slam makes from S, but 6@D makes from N|pg||
nt|haans: been there|pg||
nt|mamos: ??|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ziff:  Strong club|pg||
nt|motu: 6@C from N is cold, because of  6-1 @H |pg||
nt|lmeili: yes 6@c by N always cold, W has no @h to cash when wins @c K|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly play fast!!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|star6ija: something like 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a heart pip shourt of a good slam here   can make by dropping A@H doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|star6ija: do they change the systems?|pg||
nt|haans: all you need for slam is no clubs lead :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i dotn think j@c was played|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eweber: unluckily we still don't have running scores from group B in the Open|pg||
nt|motu: DBL is 6-8|pg||
nt|boyklas: 1@h is a transfer to @ss|pg||
nt|lmeili: easy 3N for EW|pg||
nt|boyklas: nvul, would you have bid 3@s now?|pg||
nt|motu: not my style|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam 6@C is the best spot    6@H down quickly on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but slam is a little far fetched if you ask me|pg||
nt|davidb: N practically looks at 8HCP|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT on the same|pg||
nt|star6ija: and to guess heart position of course|pg||
nt|aldek: operator, what has happened?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
mb|3D|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: 5@C is a good bet|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Where are we going now? is 4@S Keycard?|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a hand for topping up the caffeine|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||

nt|roswolf: israel missed the game on bd 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2:  hi all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|motu: hi tomi|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi Tomi|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|lmeili: wrong side to play @s|pg||
nt|motu: 2@S is 9+ any hand|pg||
nt|andersk: Sorry Im late, was dinner here:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however there's transportation problem|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eweber: I assume the final will be played with 10 teams given the number of 9 rounds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, welcome back|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|yuval10: can they reach 5@c here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: kib has asked for the link for the running score|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||

nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||

nt|andersk: Hi Martin, Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
pc|d3|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||

nt|oleberg: X probably shows 5+minor, 4major|pg||
nt|oleberg: Common on the continent|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: this is some play for 4@S   but likely to get club wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: will be a partscore here.. ew will and up in spades, dbl problably 5+ minor and a 4 crd major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jtr: Dbl is 5m - 4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: But if my guess was right, pass by West is strange|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I was wondering too|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jtr: Dbl asks for the major|pg||
nt|jeanhari: maybe Jansma wasnt sure he still could bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: Anyone knows the strenght of 1NT?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@D normally would ask for the major|pg||
nt|jtr: 14-16|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 14-16 I'm told|pg||
nt|jtr: 15-17 3/4|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: ok|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jeanhari: closed room EW are in 4@C|pg||
nt|ady: 4 level ambitious for e/w  need a lot of things to go well|pg||
nt|jeanhari: which isnt happening|pg||
nt|oleberg: And if they go to level 4, spades should be chosen :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jeanhari: indeed 4! has some theoretic chances if NS play hearts in time|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: South and West are screenmates, so it was probably Jansma considering, not South.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|oleberg: (The operator cannot use the keyboard before both players have bid. It would give away the tempo to the other side of the screen)|pg||
nt|jtr: Good lead|pg||
nt|jtr: This will probably come down to the @c guess|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed.. in the end Paulissen will have to find the @C queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: rfor the rame in the room|pg||
nt|jeanhari: which he wont get right notrh having a strong NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, North could have AKQ@d|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||

mb|3D|nt|eweber: with no bulletin online so far informations spread slowly|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this could be a thin slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: fast pace at this table|pg||
nt|cameron_1: X?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||
nt|lmeili: looks like 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems trange|pg||
nt|mamos: prsumably majors|pg||
nt|mamos: and or values   "competitive"|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||
nt|mamos: from an english poerspective these Queens all look to be in the wrong places  opponents hands rather than theirs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
nt|ady: apart from spades behaving  would need to guess diamond rightr   a poor slam|pg||

pc|dK|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||

nt|cameron_1: I think the problem started with Daid's initial choice of 2@c|pg||
nt|cameron_1: rather than X|pg||
nt|aldek: or pass|pg||
nt|cameron_1: the ebu didnt pay it table money to watch him pass|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   |pg||
nt|aldek: they never pay|pg||

nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||

nt|wygbe1: even with 31 d and 43 clubs has play|pg||
nt|peachy: right. And if it does make, vul slam is expensive to miss|pg||
nt|andersk: Most 1 @S opening does not have 6 tricks, almost incredible that he opened weak 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be very hard if @s's are 4-1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tomi2:  gogoman should ruff the heart now with the queen and wait por partners spade tricks later|pg||

nt|tomi2:  we have good and bad news from German open team. Good news is, that declarer managed to get 10 tricks in spades in this board. Bad is, that they bid slam...|pg||

nt|athene: 7@H here - let's see if they find it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
mb|5D|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||
nt|motu: vul 1nt is 18-19 non vul 20-21|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andersk: @H 9 for @D switch|pg||
nt|haans: Q and J for @D switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hQ for @s switch|pg||
nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
mc|11|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|oleberg: 2@D probably multi|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s best here|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: (A weak 2 in either major)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jeanhari: but EW bid 5@H, so a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|oleberg: 2NT looks like an inquiry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|ady: missed the boat here|pg||
nt|oleberg: And 3@D like spades|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|mc|11|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
nt|fokal: some kind of transfer ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
pc|cT|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
pc|dK|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||

mb|d|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
mb|3D|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||

mb|p|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||

pc|dK|nt|collins64: @s to the J and it's over|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead may allow it to slip home|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|boyklas: i think its not reasonable to lead the AH|pg||
nt|collins64: for sure|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6D makes here|pg||
nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
pc|sK|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||
nt|davidb: D to the 9 = 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Ouf|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|davidb: normal finesse..|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|davidb: still can make .|pg||
nt|roswolf: all hinges on the @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: end play west|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|davidb: H to K & D to the 9 -normal play|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: might play @DQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|athene: if versace doesn't balance - i think that's a sign that pass is right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|odysseus69: small spade at trick 2 would be enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|oleberg: (6@H = by ducking a spade at trck 2)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not a good time to balance|pg||
nt|jtr: Then another @d|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: 2nt is a suicide bomber|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: The light opening may backfire|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: what about another diamond then|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: But if South really wanted to compete, it would have been better to bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jeanhari: which should have been found imo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no axe...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|oleberg: (Right you are on both counts, regarding 6@H)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand but difficult to bid 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting hand, slam possible to make (@C lead puts a pressure on declearer)|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume we still have the 5:4, but not sure about board 7|pg||
nt|tomi2:  hard to follow the cardplay, but operator, pls try to be sure about the number of tricks they made :)|pg||
nt|haans: again :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: a real solo flight of fancy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT???|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-3 spade fit and both hands unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: my guess is 3nt was "serious" and also "seriously misunderstood"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: just 2 aces  in a spades contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: hmm a 4 card major opening|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: seems to be turning into a rout. 57 imps in the bag and probably another 11 from board 10, so68-0 at half-time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 58 excuse me|pg||
nt|haans: we must assume pen dbl not possible|pg||

mb|2D|nt|boyklas: at the OR 2H is playing|pg||

mb|d|nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hre we are - allez les bleus|pg||
nt|athene: some people think the double jump after t/o double should be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: others play it as limit bid; i.e. better than single jump|pg||
nt|athene: clearly Mari is in the second camp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks possible at any lead, I think - taking for given, that the @D-finesse is working |pg||
mb|3S|nt|andersk: 2@HX is probably -2|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT makes tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: impossible to guess the @c position here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also flat |pg||
nt|peachy: transfer again in N|pg||
nt|haans: good body everywere|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: 2NT from S most likely would've make her declarer, as N would've bided 3NT anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: at least 10 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: this will be down 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a perfect fit here|pg||
nt|star6ija: and 3@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: NS|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andersk: looks like the names have been corrected|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?:)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of work|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG will need to guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|mamos: that lead directing opening has resulted in the best lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulhac:  With the clubs 3-3 there is no obvious defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: have no idea why did not touch spades before diamonds|pg||
nt|andersk: SVK- ITA 2-1|pg||
nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: claim soon|pg||
nt|star6ija: trump lead is the best for EW|pg||
pc|d6|nt|star6ija: well done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||
nt|mamos: yes there are two "f" words we mustnt mention this week|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am rather depressed by the scoreline, hopefully our dutch friends will start doing something wrong soon|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|boyklas: he made it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: belguim picked up another 8 imps in board 10|pg||
nt|collins64: no|pg||
nt|boyklas: why no?|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold doesnt have many clues as to the outstanding values|pg||
pc|d4|nt|collins64: why A@c|pg||
nt|haans: well played|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still at least we are better than them at football|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: Trump continuing the good work|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||

pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||

nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||

nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||

pc|cT|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||

nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||

nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||

nt|odysseus69: nobody listened to East who screamed I HAVE MAJORS|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 4@C means I don't believe you pertner!!|pg||
nt|oleberg: East: I have good news and bad news; I have a singleton diamond, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: Paulissen left the room|pg||
nt|oleberg: Through the roof?|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: Not sure if it's for the rest room or the hospital|pg||
nt|odysseus69: which was worse- 3H or 4C?|pg||
nt|ady: surprised at Jasons 3@H    surely must know east is stuffed in majors when passing 2NT    double seems to stand out|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, one must understand 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no only you know partner has no fit, you also now partner has lenght in hearts which opp. is about to go playing|pg||
nt|jeanhari: know|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok true.. more cases for the defense?|pg||
nt|oleberg: I understand both 3@H and 4@C. 3@h is questionable, but 4@C seems normal.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that lead gets no prizes either- declarer must have 7 clubs so not many left for dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jeanhari: good news for Jansma is that the other room is in 4@H|pg||

nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: For minors-non vul against vul.|pg||
nt|haans: bidding are correct operator say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
mb|d|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: it looks like it was a quick pass from North|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: NT will be a poor strain this time, one can only hope they dont bid 3|pg||

pc|c3|nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||
nt|yuval10: for me it's 7@s indicating @d|pg||
nt|ady: 4 tricks or 8 on heart finesse |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: south doesn't see any future in hearts for the defence - he doesn't know how few declarer has, for one thing|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably with some overtricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|josj: Operator, can you check the players'names and seating please? At this point, Ekren-Berset are playing for Norway in both rooms :)|pg||

nt|oleberg: Indeed :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: I agree Ole|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jeanhari: do you think partner wil bid on with just xx in clubs en x diamond?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|jtr: Well, he would have bid 3@c with that surely?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: maybe he should but would he/she?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or maybe pass first as he did i suppose|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, the bidding might not end in 4@C, but if I double later on, partner will be well placed to make good judgement|pg||
nt|jeanhari: maybe  not with some good secondary stops|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok next board :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: And really, if you fear 4@CX with that hand, you recieve more bad breaks than I do.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, true|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Souths 3H bid shouted BAD BREAKS IN MINOR SUITS - i heard it|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but opp. arent going + if you let them play|pg||
nt|jtr: We could argue all day about the rights and wrongs on that one|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: this hand will be som imps to England, so indeed we can go on about the previous :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: overtricks at stake|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: allthough declarer doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|jtr: I wonder about 4NT over 1@s  Seems a reasonable bid to me|pg||
nt|jtr: But then you dont know whether to raise to 6 i guess|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: when east passes 2NT  you could expect around 11 suit major cards   clearly west would stiill take out to 3@C   but once next hand bids 3@H  there was obvioud danger  to bid on   ...|pg||
nt|ady: partner is not going to have to cards you need    clubs are very good   but  diamonds may play for several losers |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jtr: Better to try and get a noise out of partner at a lower level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I could live with 4NT |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: I think the worst bid in the auction was 3@h|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|jtr: As David said, East has loads of major suit cards so why do you want to play in a major?|pg||
nt|jtr: Still, it potentially gained a few IMPs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|jeanhari: no score here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|oleberg: After 3@H West simply cannot give up yet, and the highly descriptive 4@C may not win a brilliancy-price, but it doesn't contain much danger, and the hand is obviously a freak hand.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: after this result all the dutch will support England... so make it to the next stage|pg||

nt|paulg:  hi Paul, everyone|pg||
nt|tomi2:  board 12 German open pair bid 7@H missing !AS and Qxx-x in their sidesuit...|pg||
nt|yuval10: yesterday there was something similer to NS in the OR here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2210|pg||
nt|yuval10: they bided to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: vs Belgium|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they didn't make :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow always makes his grands|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: a routine 3NT now|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, not much here|pg||
nt|vasmar: good board for Austria in order to hold the difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: litle reak in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: break I mean|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx operator|pg||
nt|vasmar: but boards 14 and 15 are good for Germany|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably they will take the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will west pre-empt with 4 cards in other major?|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-0 to much|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Gerben42: who would have guessed 210 wins |pg||
nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||
nt|ady: should be a lot of bidding here |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that result doesn't seem likely, unless he played it the same way as he bid it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulhac:  Hi Paul|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this could now be very feisty|pg||
nt|star6ija: more undos|pg||
nt|haans: on track :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: ??|pg||
nt|star6ija: undo|pg||
nt|haans: N 3@D????|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: 170 will be flat|pg||
nt|motu: now 3@D would show 4441|pg||
nt|motu: there it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think e/w may well declare a heart contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: level is questionable though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt seems a stretch.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a difficult rebid the way the auction went|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt seems a bit of an underbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: J@D lead beats 5@C would have tht west might have gone straight to 4@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rigas_karo: i guess it will be difficult to stay low here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow has some ideas on working / not working finesses in Grand Slams depending on vulnerbility and board number|pg||
nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry for the shouting|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the pass by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C is rkcb and 4NT 2+@SQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am told 1 unfortunate south played in 6@s doubled on the previous board|pg||
nt|dburn: did he make it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well you might have made it David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but I think he went 1 off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tomi2:  voila|pg||
nt|lmeili: wow!|pg||
nt|ziff:  Seems to be the right board number|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you could probably write a very long article or even a book on just that board, where is David Bird|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: they may open one or two points shorter|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got 11 on board 12  where they could take all the hearts and ace of spades in 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yuval10: E was caught off guard here|pg||
nt|vasmar: no need now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: she needed to cover the @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if P has the 9 it's the same|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  South is known as fluffy on BBO and is one of the most prolific contributors to the BBO notice boards|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unfortunately the hoped for England charge was halted on previous board, 4@c doubled went 2 down|pg||

nt|jtr: Assuming South doesnt have the Q of course|pg||
nt|jtr: Which he could have possibly|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6 as they lay|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes, but more likely in north, will go for that I think|pg||
nt|jtr: Double dummy maybe, by playing the @dJ and ducking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think he will play for 2 diamond losers and clubs 3-2 if spades are 4-2|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @CT, spade spade ruff.. and so on|pg||
nt|ady: likely settle for 11 tricks   thinking that will be another good score|pg||
nt|jtr: Jason did well to not to bid|pg||
nt|jtr: There will be a few in 3@h doubled|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed now and then good to be not that aggresive |pg||
nt|odysseus69: OK what action do we all take as South over 1S|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont mind 2@h facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|jtr: Pass otherwise|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ady: west has seen his partners overcalls before|pg||
nt|roswolf: west knows his customer at any rate|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vasmar: I think 6@h make played by E (if she guesses diamonds) unless S underlead clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: a counteroffer|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  Presumably to allow more time for a decent bottle in the evening|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|boyklas: making 5|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|haans: we now all know i was right :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: another 2 imos in board 15 for germany|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|vasmar: imps|pg||
nt|vasmar: n lightner double?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|santyclz: N might have been contemplating a @h raise there.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|rigas_karo: ruff a @c, @s and claim... next board|pg||
nt|eweber: many diamonds with NE here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will somehow make I gues|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|andersk: that was well playes|pg||
nt|andersk: played|pg||
nt|eweber: Drijver no longer has to worry about a @d through his 10|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but has to take care of communication to make his 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might get stranded with @HA|pg||
nt|eweber: playing @h first might help, but both J and K are wrongsided|pg||
nt|ady: trying to steal 7the trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: fortunate @C split|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safety for 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: duck and -1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: actuallt q@s and @d, declarer has to guess what to do for the overtrick, but both lines work|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: I am wrong again makes.|pg||
nt|vasmar: true|pg||

nt|eweber: I see no good reason to guess hearts right here|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|h6|nt|ady: still only down 1 as defence cant communicate to get 8th tricks    south had to cash 2nd heart   not easy|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eweber: ...unless|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there is a reason|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he thinks @CK is onside|pg||
nt|eweber: ...he thinks @c finess is working and wants to get back to his hand now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but unlikely to think so with @D 6-1|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|star6ija: nicely done|pg||
nt|haans: good play by Haraldson|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulhac:  Can someone give the running scores address ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as I thought, @D 6-1 led him to think Khven simply ducked|pg||
nt|eweber: now he has a new problem|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but if so, why not play @C2 instead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even if he finds @HJ will go down now|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume he was hoping to endplay West with Kxx|pg||

nt|jtr: And West may then devalue his hand|pg||
nt|nyg8:  or bid 3H to show hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west has all wrong cards but 4S looks tempting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: did north denie 4 crd major normally?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays will be overboard|pg||
nt|jtr: They play 4-card suits|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|nyg8:  probably yes, but 3H is better than 4C, if anything Jason should bid 3C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jeanhari: remember another hand where is was wise not to play the hand :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nyg8:  poor bidding in my ootion|pg||
nt|nyg8:  2N to ask for shortness is much better, now they are just guessing|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|nyg8:  W should realize that E has short C so his hand is poor|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@S here depend on heart play after a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: If they bid 4, defence always take their 4 minor suit tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: maybe :)|pg||
nt|haans: xx standard here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 3@s assuming south does not try to cash @c ace|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for providing this service to bridge lovers worldwide.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently only 14 tables on vg. http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like one too many|pg||
nt|haans: 23.45 central time next session|pg||
nt|haans: 13.45 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: 5@D made so 9 to Neth.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: well done|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: when in hand @CQ and !K@C to force W to play Ace @C|pg||
nt|vasmar: unmakeable|pg||
nt|vasmar: only Kx in hearts onside|pg||
nt|drkvas: v well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Vive la France - 920|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1370|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: small @c now can could could problems|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jtr: Quite where Brink found the double of 5@h i really dont know|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: hope to stop them bidding on?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  7H is makeable obviously|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jeanhari: 5@H dbl by Brink in the closed room showed interest to bid on..|pg||
nt|ady: spade save is good    |pg||
nt|oleberg: Looks like 1@C contain all balanced hands, and 4@C is SA-Texas|pg||
nt|nyg8:  4C? strange|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or rather strong@C and SA-Texas|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but maybe they dont play that anymore as north did not bid on|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i guess so|pg||
nt|nyg8:  sort of auction that someone can forget the system.|pg||
nt|ady: this hand again swingy|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i play that but only if it is 'our hand'  Doesnt seem clear that it is|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will ew reach 6@H and gain a few.. of lose about 11 for not doing so|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must see an slamtry now by Jansma|pg||
nt|ady: Jason can vire to save in 6@S    most unlikely they will go to 7@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: view|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jeanhari: but south to bid first|pg||
nt|jeanhari: only 5@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S from South then -well 6H now for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: We dont know the strength of 4@c|pg||
nt|nyg8:  4S by E? 6C by W and then....|pg||
mb|5S|mb|6H|nt|nyg8:  5S by E, 6C by W?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: do we expect 6@H now?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: too late to ask :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Not any more:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what does 6S cost?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 6@S then pass......|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe South should have saved?|pg||
nt|oleberg: 6@S coming up|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s could have been anything|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 7@H coming up after pass by east?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i think P by N|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes me too|pg||
nt|oleberg: If South has 5 spades it is cheap insurance for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|nyg8:  no clear if 6H can make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg: Might beat 5@H|pg||
nt|nyg8:  from N position|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed obvious pass by north|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|jtr: It was for South to save but not clear|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jeanhari: to another 5 imps to the dutch|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Impressive performance by them, well done|pg||

nt|roswolf: and to my fellow commentators the 2 Davids|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm is the tourny web-site.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unusual to say the least?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vasmar: this is tha last board|pg||

nt|pitiful:  a great board to finish the match|pg||
nt|mamos: even at this vul?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if e-w do get pushed to 7@h will he make it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 back to England on 17 |pg||
nt|pitiful:  south wisely did not overcall |pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|santyclz: 2@d or a @c splinter?|pg||
nt|cumino: bilanciatone senza cuori|pg||
nt|rialc2: secondo te non ha tentato il fit a @H?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and e-w did well to bid and make 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
mb|d|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cumino: sry|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
mc|13|nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
