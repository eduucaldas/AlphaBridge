nt|lestergold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: EW natural with a strong NT. NS Precision with a 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjy:  I wouldn't have bid 5@D with the south hand, partner was only competing, he could have doubled 3@D or bid 3@H with a good hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensuring the contract safety play.|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running scores|pg||
nt|haans: TG CC say Flannery :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||

nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be reluctant to pass this |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d looks to be a safer partial than 3@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: i still think the score in board 1 is wrong|pg||
nt|shevek: we don't have a score in bd 1|pg||
nt|shevek: you mean bd 2 Vlad?|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 i meant|pg||
nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||

nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we know he has 8, but he does not|pg||
nt|haans: england can take it|pg||
nt|jallerton: they got there in the other room when W doubled 2@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak two in a major, 2@H/@S=two-suited|pg||
nt|haans: imagnative leads not succeeding are not popular|pg||

nt|haans: hi Jean|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
pc|hK|nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly dubinin dictated fine|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: EW cannot take many clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk5: Operator, there is a typo in North's name.  EKREN|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk5: Reverse the  R and K|pg||

nt|vbman: ---------------4-------------------|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again a tricky hand NS with combined 25 hcp may end up in 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: in my cristal l see several down in 3 nt|pg||
nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||
nt|henryb:  since 6@c depends on guessing who has the doubleton @h A (or singleton)|pg||
nt|benjy:  you are completely scuppered|pg||
mb|1C|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nystr√∂m far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel ogs√• ha √•pnet med 2@h der, s√• da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||

nt|h_karluk: ok ty gl there|pg||

nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||

nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||

nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||

nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||

nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||

nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
mb|6H|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: carbon copy auctions are very rare|pg||
nt|paulg:  I've only played against Fredin a couple of times, but he is one of the more imaginative that I've seen|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|sQ|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||

mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||

nt|lestergold: well  could be repeated here double is normal holding two bullets opposite an opener|pg||
nt|jfaria: but doubt they will reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: although looks like 11 tricks so maybe england got away lightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i would pass to 2@h|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why did not rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7, 5@C -1, @S wrong guess.|pg||
nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||

pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: makes the work easy.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|shevek: not much point in winning either :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: 11 toptricks - time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Sweden :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andersk: -1, good result for NS here! As the layout is, 3 NT makes EW|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Please tell how 2@H made 9 tricks on board 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i agree its controversial but here you have a misfit and the heart suit and a k makes it unlikely not impossible that oppos have a game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||

nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||
pc|h6|nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what do you fancy for dinner- thats the question I just answered|pg||

nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: has to run this, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: IMPs right i assume|pg||
nt|paulg:  as happened to Scotland's women in the previous match, bidding a thin grand slam when the opposition are only in game is not a winning formula|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|rnmalik: Sorry-connection problem.|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||
nt|pelu: why not?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  Kxx in E hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jfaria: next pl|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||

nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||

nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||

nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||

nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||

nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||

nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||

nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||

nt|roswolf: well it is all in declarer's hands|pg||

nt|jillan:  one D on the Da, one on the SK and one on the 4th C|pg||

nt|roswolf: if he thinks clubs are 4-2 he might play to ruff his diamond in hand|pg||

nt|copeyj: but Cullin may have other ideas, and if he does he is probably right|pg||
nt|jillan:  closing my eyes and wishing|pg||
nt|copeyj: might come down to whether he believes the @C3 from Justin, which if a true card would show an odd number|pg||

pc|d2|nt|pauleger: okay thx Thierry|pg||
nt|ady: england have got big swings on 2 slam hands   one 50-50 and are fortunate to be ahead |pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: I think Gold is scared that they may have missed a game and doesnt want to push his luck knowing they cannot outbid e/where|pg||
nt|jallerton: prepared to look very silly|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: working on it|pg||

nt|jallerton: but here 4@h has 4 losers on a @d lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, this is a strange decision - does Townsend think he is behind?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: small @H now, but declarer will probably guess to put up the King|pg||
nt|haans: yes danes not easy to fool :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 tricks likely here - so net gain of 820|pg||
nt|copeyj: 13 imps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A reasonable game.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jfaria: im told 2@d= 11-14 5-5 8-14 5-4 |pg||
nt|jfaria: hard to W to guess...|pg||
nt|vasmar: he has 4 good cards in majors|pg||
nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||
nt|jfaria: those calls are ackward to meet when weak and get strong fit, otherwise a very big gap to to fill|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems random to me with no outside entry, even if his minor values are soft|pg||
nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said at the start, this result will count in the second round robin as well as teams only play the qualifiers from the other group|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why can't they start at the same time each day?|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 am 12.30 pm your time|pg||

nt|vasmar: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|jfaria: again Majors ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes because of the spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@H here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: might be a delicate contract though|pg||
nt|copeyj: i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|haans: 2!GH 3 card support 11-13|pg||
nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rodvenn: 3 nt is a natural contract which will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult hands to bid n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: altho townsend may double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: too much of his hand in @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||

nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||

nt|jfaria: last hand, thanks to my fellow commentators, and all the super kibs we got :) operator was great too |pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende.  Great concentration!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: last 5 tricks|pg||
