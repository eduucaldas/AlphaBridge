nt|gelutu: tomorrow will be more 32 boards to play|pg||
nt|gelutu: here are two pairs who performed very well in 1st segment of the Final|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi |pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: we can see 6@S makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: Edy Munteanu playing with Eugen Chelu and Max Rotaru with Ov Ghigheci|pg||
nt|pisoy: 4@H a little bit better then 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 1h alerted as spades|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: but it is not a slam you want to be in missing the queen of trump and an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Sorrely I need to leave. Have promissed the Watermark to comment there:(|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pisoy: in the last board|pg||
nt|lml: the double does help a lot though|pg||
nt|lml: now you are likely going to work out who has the trump queen|pg||
nt|lml: of course you have to find the spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: both pairs play improved natural systems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: 1@H was obviously spades and now campbell shows he has 5|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: thx Rodal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Any slam to be seen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: sorry about board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: we have connection problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Hello all  :) :) @H @H |pg||

nt|vugraphznx: I'm Githa your operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: @H enjoy watching @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the big problem I hope. EW had 3@S in|pg||
nt|rodal f: If they tryed for 4 itnormaly was one down.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|lml: with some help from the opponents it is just too tough to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pisoy: in a good day you could make it ,starting with Q@D|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|cokodidi: karwur and sacul are one of the greatest player for Indonesia  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: Max-Ov play 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|gelutu: and first unmakeable game is bid by Locmotiva here|pg||

mb|6C|nt|lml: Campbell has to consider bad breaks.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: campbell in thought...going 'uh huh' under his breath a lot|pg||
nt|lml: yes this is a tough hand in a way... lots to think about|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a spade finesse, diamond to dummy, spade finesse|pg||
nt|lml: still leaving a trump in dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if the second diamond is ruffed he is okay if trump are 3-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A bid for a push I precume. NT would been a bit more fun|pg||
nt|rodal f: Home by 2 IMPs on.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 0 - 0 ain't the result after 5 rounds by 7 played:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gelutu: seems impossible for EW not take AD after 3 times gain lead in S, so -1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gelutu: but now|pg||
nt|pisoy: no:)|pg||
nt|pisoy: this is a flat one|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gelutu: discard is possible|pg||
nt|gelutu: and impossible game is home|pg||
nt|lml: if he can pick up trump and make one club ruff he is good|pg||
nt|lml: that gives him 3 diamonds, 5 spades, two hearts and a club ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: May u give us the status Gabhi?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: one more than enough actually|pg||
nt|don_kapu: just 5 tricks for1nt = 200 for EW|pg||

nt|andyv:  Frank, I was looking at this hand as a spec... it seems that W took a very conservative approach in not doubling |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|lml: after the elimination ace and one will work.  Is that where he is headed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: balcombes head is down in thought|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has to have at least one of the club honors,he knows that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: he should also know that E has one too because of the 2S bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: club honors are likely split|pg||

nt|gelutu: part-score battle|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: EW play weak NT, NS strong NT|pg||
mb|2C!|an|1 suiter|nt|sommer: 4@S looks more like it|pg||
nt|lml: which could happen|pg||

pc|hA|nt|don_kapu: ternyata temperamen S adalah penyabar|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: thinking....|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: it just doesnt seem fair your side has 24 high and you cant beat 4@S the other way|pg||
nt|lml: I like dropping the @SJ here if West plays to dummy.  The problem with the @SQ is you aren't that likely to double with the stiff queen|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hmm danger line of play course Hikmat has 4 cds @C|pg||
nt|gracelin: an easy 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to say. At the edge|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d suit will be his downfall (as well as the 3-1 trump break)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|pisoy: easy to make +1 now|pg||
nt|ketoprak: W promised 16+ with 5 cds, so it will be easy to reach the game|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: of course the stiff jack has almost the same problme|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|nt|donsabin: not the easiest contract to bid|pg||

pc|s4|nt|don_kapu: 3nt + 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Alfi:)|pg||
nt|ketoprak: both pairs using Precision, as most of Indonesian players..|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hmm|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pisoy: but 5@H ,easy to make|pg||
nt|lml: its nice when they listen to you|pg||

nt|lml: so do you double on Qxx of trump or not?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: otomatis|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Will S be ice enough to drop first and second @D play? Belive not.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: commentator loses again and this time you lose too Nick!|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I might bid 3NT with the north hand after south comoeted to 3D,  All I need is Axxxxx of D from partner.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I will say that W normaly promice more than a standard 16. Normaly wourth 18+ by my system.|pg||
nt|ketoprak: @s switch freezing the defender...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: oddly enough for a push|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C will be better from E now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he can't see that.|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but S just doesn't have enough trump even if he guesses @ds correctly|pg||
nt|andyv:  he still has to ruff 2@h and a @d and has only 2 trump in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|donsabin: only a brave 4NT by W, showing 64 in the minors...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a new drop at @D? Belive 9 is on|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pisoy: maybe 4nt to show 6/4 |pg||

pc|dA|nt|gelutu: this 5C from S not very nice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|don_kapu: kemungkinan Hikmat Pass 4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, he did play it well... that's why it was unfortunate (for NS) that @ss didn't break.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gelutu: he downgraded KS|pg||
nt|gelutu: but after 4C he must now that even singleton spade is good|pg||

pc|hA|nt|pisoy: better for Edy to bid 3d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pisoy: now i suppose he showed 6cl and 5h|pg||
nt|donsabin: even if he mented a splinter bid I would not think it is ok to imply a second suit|pg||
nt|pisoy: a splinter without fit,is strange|pg||
nt|donsabin: Chelu definetely supposed that:)|pg||
nt|pisoy: easy claim here|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess this is -1 but still a small gain since in closed room EW somehow made 140 in 3S.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pisoy: yup|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mcphee: we followed the play perfectly operator:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: 1H = Spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting set of boards in the sense that there were only 3 part scores.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mcphee: here Taylor has a problem, to bid or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: 3NT?|pg||
nt|cokodidi: ur wlc g1tha .. came with the last board show ... lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sommer: D|pg||
nt|bogdann60:  looks like a good bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: wisely passedm whih may not work out in his best interests|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@S = big raise of @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: now he may dble|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: LOTS OF EXPL|pg||
nt|cokodidi: thx all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gelutu: also 9 tricks here, but missed thin game|pg||
nt|gelutu: in 3NT best lead will be H to K for spade return but W has only 2 spades|pg||
nt|gelutu: so EW will take only 2 hearts 1 spade 1 club|pg||
nt|pisoy: hard to make 4@S here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Only 30 min before Europeian Chamionship start. Looking forward for that as I did for this |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|donsabin: kamikaze reopen|pg||
nt|donsabin: how about 3@c?:)|pg||
nt|pisoy: eh...another life:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sommer: on @Dlead E may make it|pg||
nt|pisoy: just made|pg||
nt|mcphee: good 3@D as that K@S is worth zip now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sommer: ..but best defence sets it, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: plus no help at all in the @C suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so a possible swing this board as it appears n/s have some play for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  no problems here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gelutu: here Eugen played safety... no trump promotion possible|pg||
nt|gelutu: he plays against 5 clubs in W hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sommer: the next card may give the contract.......|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: a thoughtful switch here|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SQ and a small @D?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|donsabin: a sry I didn't see the first dbl|pg||

nt|andyv:  this hand much more of a pain in matchpoints|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gelutu: now is +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Last board.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|donsabin: then the second dbl is poor:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pisoy: a small @h back,more intersting|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzjx: CLAIM3|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|pisoy: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  might as well take @d finesse... he can't be sure where A@s is|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he can be:)|pg||
