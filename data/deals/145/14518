nt|jaapfr: doess EW play same sys as drijver-Brink?|pg||
nt|lesniak: jak marek powiedzial- zabezpiecza kilka opcji|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: although EW 1NT in first position non-vul is 9-12.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: i pewnie powie|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesniak: watpie niezwykle|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a jednak nie|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW play natural with (mainly) weak NT.  1m is natural (3)4+|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: 1st favourable.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has no S in his name.|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: thk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: meanwhile, this is the 9-12 version, and NS have elected to try to penalise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as against that, EW are probably in an 8 card fit, which means the double could be shaded, and S surely has 5 hearts. so at these colors i think there is a strong case for 2H|pg||
nt|lesniak: przeciez nie wie czy przeciwnicy nie zostali juz przeciagnieci a jest na bezposredniej pozycji|pg||
nt|lesniak: powiedzialbym ze wybitnie niefartowne rozdanie|pg||

nt|andreasw:  Nadia(Bekkouche) need's to guess the @s to win|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: it could be a disaster tho at unfave vul when townsend only has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|skollie: EW play close to the system Jansma-Verhees play(ed) - 'Orange Club', a lot like old fashioned Polish Club|pg||
nt|skollie: but they made some changes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now with the lead it will just make|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 2@C was artificial relay (checkback)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: in any case, what S has promised is offense, not defense, and as i said, S almost surely has 5 hearts. even if not, it is unlikely to be  disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it has not made yet!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||

nt|odysseus69: but d better?|pg||
nt|lestergold: might encourage west to play for drop|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|christinas: Ron in N has a 15-count but chose to D rather than bid 1nt because of the vulnerability|pg||
nt|skollie: Blakset needs to finesse in spades to make this, now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and he still has no clue to do so imo|pg||

nt|mareczek: mylê, ¿e 4@s powinno pokazywaæ 6-9 PC bez czterech kierów|pg||
nt|lesniak: stracilismy 11 impow w rozdaniu 2 - raczej na skutek swietnego rozwiazania przez Izrael na obu stolach|pg||
nt|mareczek: ostatnie s³owo do Bala|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead could have been the ace of @C and a look at the signal and then......|pg||
nt|copeyj: e/w likely to play 2@h now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lasu: tämä me jo nähtiin|pg||
nt|lesniak: -|pg||
nt|lesniak: ostatnie slowo nalezalo do Cezarego - trudno sie dziwic ze nie powiedzial 5 pik|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or even at green, as Zia did in the American Trials yesterday|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he went for 500 against 430, so only a small loss|pg||
nt|skollie: N will lead @dQ and 11 tricks will be made|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: W  a negative double |pg||
mb|4C|nt|rado: desperate effort to promote trump trick for defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: towsend rock minimum for his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this can make double dummy on this lead but i fear iy wont make in practice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it will|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here unluckily it is wrong sided - 4nt not safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E will not enjoy discarding twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can safely discard clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or if declarer plays 2 top diamonds it is over|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is that an abovious line|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when q@d drops does that deny the J!?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he discards clubs declarer's task is easy as little temptation to try club hook|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no, but there is restricted choice, plus some possibility that with diamonds that good he might have led one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he cashes his hearts East will be forced to make at leas 1 club discard and declarer will guess to play on diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possibe Victor but he has to play well if he is to makem this|pg||
nt|april7: a small swing for Germany  by making 3 @C losing only 1 trick in every suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H by E|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they should get there |pg||
mb|4D|nt|jaapfr: 4@S by W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 4@H by E:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good lead 2@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how can south bid 2 dia, you know simon?|pg||
nt|copeyj: because they play 4 card suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when they have 4cM and weak NT they open 1M|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 1@D is often 5 for them|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so that promisses 3+ with an honour?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Gerber ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|copeyj: i dont think it "promises" that|pg||
nt|copeyj: i mean he was non vul|pg||
mb|5H|nt|copeyj: and just trying to be awkward for the opps|pg||
nt|copeyj: but yes if you like :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok so just a 3 card raise- thx|pg||
nt|copeyj: he wants partner to lead @D if partner on lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a few values|pg||
nt|copeyj: this looks like down 1 in any case|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i meant with promising an honour:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it just seems normal to run hearts then play 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there is a late discard coming in spades|pg||
nt|copeyj: Romania credited with 10 tricks here on board 2 - but looks unlikely because they claimed at T1 and there were only 9 then|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so ns must keep playing dia |pg||
nt|rmb1: I suspect a pass is missing?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  yes and N-S reach 6@h -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no spade lead in the open room|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 6@h E-W here:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|lasu: näyttäs kotipeliltä jos vetää hertta maskin|pg||
nt|copeyj: note the @DJ at T1 from Gold|pg||
nt|copeyj: tells his partner exactly what was going on in that suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: I suspect EW did not bid after 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: if LHO does have QJx of diamonds there is still the spade king onside possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see this failing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but then i dont see my own failings either:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes since WEst has at least 8 major cards playing diamonds looks natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can we call that a profesional play simon?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if Trine(Binderkrantz) had made the right lead:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=39931&st=0& entry471653  if you want to read why the match Russia-Netherlands yesterday finished 18-2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  miss guessed*|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: operator? what happened? another dia?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: it heralds a long match when you hold 31 HCP including all aces and three kings and you have to sweat to make 4NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@C - Nat or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they could make a club trick @C |pg||
mb|2C|nt|kippari: ikävän näköinen jako:)|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@c polish, 1@d usually negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Justin unusually silent over 2D in Open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: both sides can make 3 of  a amjor|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: please!!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thats wrong for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: They claimed after ace of heart|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kippari: saas nähdä mihin koneet pysähtyvät|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@h two way - 12-14 bal or strong with @h|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they claimed-? not possible he claimed 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: The only play is to play through @HAx, but declarer guessed wrong as to which defender had that holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: double is pass or convert|pg||
nt|skollie: 1@s waiting and EW will play in 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I now hear that an appeal brought back 2 VPs to both teams, so they only lost 3 each|pg||
nt|april7: an impossible 5 @D contract to make,because of no access to dummy for @H finesse, except EW leads @H sometime|pg||
nt|april7: 4 or 5 @D now!!!|pg||
nt|april7: good idea also 3 NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S here showed 4+@D i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@H natural reverse|pg||
nt|copeyj: no idea why Florin isn't bidding @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: either at his first turn or his second|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: yes he did and i cuold nt hear explanation|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok- that looked funny|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kippari: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice comprehensible auction|pg||

nt|bogier: trudno komentowaæ wirtualne zagrania na tym stole|pg||

nt|lesniak: dosyc plaskie to rozdanie nawet jak cezary wstawi K pik to obroncy nic nie moga mu zrobic|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: must be values|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S prolly gf asking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C other room see if they get there too |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 7 of Townsend's 10 points are in perfect place (K@H and A@C)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janhamhurg: so 1 spade denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only beating lead is @s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: no pass with hearts (agree unlikely here) or bid 2s with spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: so far hard work and only a few specks of blood here and there |pg||
nt|april7: after 1@S opening 3@S could have also a good bid asking for a stop in @S, but S wanted to try for more with this hand!!!|pg||
nt|april7: a possible lead 10 of @H?????|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 1 dia shows hearts and 1 heart shows spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lasu: Norjan joukkueesta puuttuu tänä vuonna Hellnees - Helgemo pari mutta tasoa Norjassa riittää. Hoftaniska on tuttu niille suomalaisille jotka ovat pelanneet Rovaniemellä tai ...|pg||
nt|lasu: Saariselällä koska hän asuu Vadsössä.|pg||
nt|kippari: kyllä tässä pelattavaa riittää|pg||
nt|odysseus69: doesnt matter a jot here but if West is giving count then I am sure that the right way is to play 2nd highest|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|christinas: I imagine both teams expect to be at the top of the group. 3 vps can turn out quite expensive|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still Denmark heading (51-37?)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after 3 rounds|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sweden will be pleased to make game here.  Not so clear on a major-suit lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes not easy maybe Trine could have made a move in bidding|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: Dutch took 7 bids and OR 2 bids to both end in 2@S:)|pg||
nt|christinas: Funny that it took 4 rounds of bidding to reach 2@s. At many tables it will probably go 1@c - 2@s all pass|pg||
nt|skollie: meanwhile NS can't make anything with 25 HCP between them - they can't even bid|pg||
nt|christinas: NS has 25 hcp combined and still cannot make anything of significance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you seem to agree with us Christina:)|pg||
nt|christinas: but still a bit surprising that none of the two NS pairs intervened|pg||
nt|lesniak: rozdanie sie zaczyna komplikowac...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and the x on 1 spade shows SPADES|pg||
nt|copeyj: well done|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|april7: 5NT was last chance for a makable contract, very good decision by Auken|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes good 5@C |pg||

nt|copeyj: amazing lead |pg||

nt|jaapfr: x@C|pg||
nt|christinas: Blakset in teh S seat bids rather aggressively - He could have bid 2@c, but too risky if Jansma had a good hand with such a lousy suit|pg||
nt|lesniak: jesli teraz S zagra trefla to cezary jest faworytem do wppadki:(|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kippari: nopea 3NT näyttäis olevan korteissa|pg||
nt|yannis3012: lucky 9 tricks here for n-s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the freaky EW hands 5@D-1 a very logic result|pg||
nt|christinas: 5 @d should be a good contract, but both minor suits break disastrously|pg||
nt|skollie: interesting - i expected jansma to overcall 1@h|pg||
nt|skollie: Ron has an interesting problem now|pg||
nt|skollie: bid spades, diamonds or double?|pg||
nt|christinas: I like the 2Nt bid, it takes away space and serves as a good preempt when he is not vulnerable and the opps are. But it could keep them out of the contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D i should think|pg||
nt|christinas: or perhaps even lead them to make it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i doubt 5@D can be made|pg||
nt|skollie: i would think they play 3@c as a good diamond raise here|pg||
nt|skollie: 3@d seems too little|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you must be rite|pg||
nt|skollie: you wouldn't want to miss your spade fit|pg||
nt|mareczek: straszne zagêszczenie srodkowych jart|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H = 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS 5-card majors|pg||

nt|mareczek: kart|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rado: if longest and strongest lead some 8 for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true as a kib said : 3nt is very cool contract here (cool and cold:)|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak Cezary grall 4 pik nie  5 pik:(:( sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: other room instead of 2@D / 3@D |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nice 4 hearts here|pg||

mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: thanks muriel|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: another misunderstanding,this time by  EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: tough for W to raise , but he might hv values his stiff dia and scraped a bid of 4h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: unbid game here  there wil be first swing for england |pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam make's here but not bid able?|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: 1@D may be three cards|pg||
nt|rado: good lead but still 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|yannis3012: a very good stop for spain with 24 hcps|pg||
nt|rado: some might open 1NT with S hand|pg||
nt|christinas: I think 5@d can be made on a crossruff - 1@h, 2@cs and 8 @d tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mareczek: tu nie ma nadmierncyh emocji|pg||

pc|s9|nt|skollie: Ron may raise here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in 5@D i fear not able to trump @C enough|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: the reason 2@C is dangerous is that North can be presumed to have no major, and if he doesn't have diamond support (ok, he does here) then the one suit he must have is clubs  |pg||

nt|yannis3012: so u think its a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: south promissed points and hearts only|pg||
nt|psridhar: Townsend's X will discourage Gold -looking at QJ of spd himself, looks like pd is X ing with a stiff/void in spd..means he is not keen on slam?|pg||

nt|Walddk12: Well, that's a bit harsh|pg||
nt|jillan:  she neither drinks or have the habit of going down in makeable contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  yes a bit but then again u never know what is going on in declarer's head |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Apparently she hates "cecilia", she's "cilla"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk12: She did place @DK with South remember|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: Gold didnt eant to be done out of a possibole spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially vulnerable when bidding these close games is so vital at teams|pg||
nt|Walddk12: It went @D6 to the ace|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: he will make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a lot of crossruff in this hand |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: suppose redbl was @H support|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|christinas: i wouldn't call it a slam|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and 3n is not an absurd contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: this may well go three off as long as east ducks that dim which is pretty obvious|pg||

nt|jaapfr: despite 27 hcp|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk12: West did not bid her clubs at either table. Direct spade raise at one, 2@D here. Then you can forget about clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk12: By the way, the club suit died in the 60's|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol:)|pg||
nt|jillan:  I did not say that 6S is a good contract, only that is makes :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Double by South now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6N makes 6@c not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a fan of 2N on the S hand, especially facing an unpassed hand -- 2N is a real slam-killer. bad enough when opps preempt us, we dont have to do it to ourselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|petere: 1@D 2+ (not 10-12 bal)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a two suited hand not a balanced hand of course|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 5@C bid very tempting great pass by W|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: why not 4 spades?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: slam try |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4333 is nothing to be exited about|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: operator!!!!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petere: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|petere: 2@H done|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lead is 3rd and low from odd,|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: If East leads @D9 and North plays @D10 from dummy, East needs to duck|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Not sure why Sandra did not raise spades in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: must be heading for the doomed club slam|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@D in Gold & doulbe in East |pg||
nt|psridhar: XX=ace|pg||
nt|Walddk12: To me that is a clear 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Anyway, probably a flat board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: may play on hearts|pg||
nt|rado: no enough entries to check both red suits|pg||
nt|rado: now|pg||
nt|rado: enought|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 6C - not too lucky|pg||
nt|petere: 5 tricks for the defence, eh?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: redouble to show 1 control |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why 2@s should make?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: a very reasonable contract on a normal club break|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 42-36 with 1 board to go|pg||
nt|lesniak: wygrywa impas pik ale jak rozgrywac - ciezko powiedziec, zapytajcie Jacka pszczoly ktory jest na trybunach i suie na tym najlepiej zna|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: now bw?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes seems he gives up !|pg||
nt|psridhar: this hopefully shd end the auction let s see|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see what South decide |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but south has extras|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i would bid 6 with the south hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has to see that he needs SPd Q, H ace, dia ACE, and KQ of club from Gold, unlikely he will bid 4s with those|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think that north shows about that with his 3 bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South takes his time |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we have more than 20 min for 2 boards---|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: 43 minuts left|pg||

nt|lestergold: true|pg||

nt|lestergold: are u envisaging a pinning diamond finesse etc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt help|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my computer predicts nisht machen im afraid|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not envisioning anything except the person who sings at the end of things sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzers p[oint out that 6nt is an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Eamon well i think the singer will be Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: at tyhe end of this hand i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think mike said that at the start of the hand|pg||
nt|eamongall: Meanwhile over in London its 44-43 to one of the tennis players in the long game ... 8 hours now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: or you did victor:)|pg||
