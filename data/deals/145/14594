mb|1H|nt|paulg:  a very important match for both teams, who will both be aiming for a top finish|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fredin may bid 3@s more for the lead than anything else|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||

nt|mamos: south thinks Oh gawd here we go again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eweber: 2@s shows 4-9 and Sabine is not known for underbidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the placement of cards 4@H has a good play for NS.|pg||
nt|dimi: Iceland (200 VP) the current leader of group A is facing Germany (168.5 VP) the fifth of group A |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: looks aty least down 1     had a place with spade finesse right|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe I should add that it shows @s+m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello all!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S shows 5+ 5+ minor 4-9 so about as expected i guess|pg||
nt|arvidsson: De spelar ett starkklöver system (väldigt likt Bernys system) så mycket relä och många zz har vi framför oss)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vbman: yes 2 or 3d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: anyone know the 1NT range?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says (14)15-17|pg||
nt|haans: do not expect a dim loser|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Makeable contract, the defense taking 1@C+1@H+1@S=3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello haans.|pg||
nt|haans: bad lead :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E had no choice, imo:)|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for wijs-muller seams to be new entry|pg||
nt|paulg:  now Fredin wishing he'd bid 3@s!|pg||
nt|dimi: hi Gerben :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all, hi dimi and gerben!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: plsuppose he does not want south in|pg||
nt|haans: well lots of @H not correct for bids|pg||
nt|dimi: unfortunately it is not possible to identify the players yet|pg||
nt|Gerben42: possible swing board|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Jan :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: some pairs will be in 6, unfortunately both opps have an obvious @C lead...|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hej Fredrik, Mikael och Eric|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och zz för de som inte vet är ett annat sätt att räkna honörspoäng, där man inte räknar knektar, A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|affe82: wlc all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: to p,lay trump thru|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: upgraded 14  I assume      although good high cards   3 small and 2 small optimistic ti call that a good 14|pg||
nt|haans: and xx just to much|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hej Roland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: east could be GROMOV|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ady: unfortunate top heavy in diamonds opposite singleton |pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Ben|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT = bid what you think you can make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: could well scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and will do well if he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: even one off no disaster|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: Cannot shorten trumps from both hands to avoid 4-1 break, small @C to table to play @H.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: bloddy first board|pg||
nt|benjy:  Hi Roland|pg||
nt|benjy:  Hi guys|pg||

nt|arvidsson: med hj sak, blir det enklare att gissa i hj för spelföraren |pg||
nt|arvidsson: ?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: This would be bid in OR and would be a flat board |pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|eweber: good morning|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hello Elke, Mike and Peter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: k@D  the K@S   then 4 hearts is a good spot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well done to play @h A there and not a small one|pg||
nt|affe82: och @d K?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If anybody wants explanations about this 2 @D, do not hesitate to write me|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: EW natural with a strong NT. NS Precision with a 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|benjy:  I wouldn't have bid 5@D with the south hand, partner was only competing, he could have doubled 3@D or bid 3@H with a good hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s not for the fainthearted|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: ensuring the contract safety play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: the EW 1@c can be gooey|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a brave affort by Towsend but defence has also done well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello mikes and specs:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome Marshall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|benjy:  and the XX is completely ridiculous in my view|pg||
nt|haans: or had bid 4@D as invite|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: but he have no accept|pg||
mc|8|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps actually the @sQ was played|pg||
nt|haans: @CQ RIGHT?????????????????????????????|pg||

nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men man skall komma ihåg att det är bra mycket enklare för oss som ser alla händer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A quiet start, it seems |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you should try to win the matches versus the strong teams in the round robin, because those results count later in the final|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hjälper inte att spela @c då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tursamt nog ser vi alla händer, gör att vi ibland kan analysera rätt :)|pg||
nt|affe82: utspelet gjorde väl i praktiken att s alltid var hemma|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I make coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
nt|dimi: at the other table Baldursson-Jonsson is facing Pikarek-Smirnov|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
nt|dimi: Wladow-Elinescu play a strong @c-system with strong NT |pg||
nt|Gerben42: Baldursson - Jonsson were part of the 1991 Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, efter utspelet så var det nog tungbetat om spelföraren spelade rätt|pg||
nt|affe82: ew ending up in 3@c after a 3rd hand oping by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems light at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running scores|pg||
nt|haans: TG CC say Flannery :)|pg||
nt|dimi: Magnusson-Haraldsson play 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: iceland here is playing a variable no trump range and transfer bid over a 1 cl opening|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Här väljer N att inte fråga efter @s färgen|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3 @D is the final contract, do you agree on bidding 3 @D Fredrik?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: the 11th trick needs to come from @C|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he avoid 2 club looser?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
nt|gohar: they deserve penality|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: given the 5-5 distribution he can play Ace and low @C!|pg||
nt|affe82: vilket är ett gott avvägande med den fördelningen i mitt tycke|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
nt|arvidsson: med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag det är ett bra val|pg||
nt|arvidsson: it will definitly go off 1 or 2 depending on play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
nt|hedyg: went down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1 sek brb|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To bid ANYTHING with the West-hand is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just ducked the @c and let E ruff and make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H seems to be makeable and that is 620, lets see|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 4@h should have been won|pg||
nt|hedyg: ducking the @c lead he loses 1@c 1ruff and 1@s|pg||
nt|gohar: yes @c lead|pg||

nt|gohar: 4@h better|pg||

nt|affe82: troliga 10 här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag att det ofta är rätt i partävling, men i lagtävling föredrar jag nog en högfärgsfråga faktiskt|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: faran är om partnen har 5 kortshögfärg|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det är inte förbjudet att öppna med Ax i @h med 2 NT, Och varför ta risken|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
nt|gohar: what abt the other table?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: eller @c för den delen|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Gerben42: Elinescu can then drop the @CJ under the A|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket man tyvärr får ha i 2nt, men i regel brukar jag tänka kan nt vara rätt? då bjuder jag nt (inget bra tips att ta efter)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: elimination of spades and hearts and then the queen of cl|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok no guesses left for N and no squeeze so 1 of, better for defence would earlier on attacking @H |pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|arvidsson: instead of returning @D a @H would mist likley give 2 off|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|xenya: i don't believe that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice defence |pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|marlowepi: diamond lead would make more sense if it were more likely that N could give S an eventual ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: i dont see why it wouldntr be good for lead direction, when EW are as likely to declare NT as anything else|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in fact spade lead represented only real chance to beat 2C, and probably would have|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: here it would not be wrong to open 2N in third seat. slam is much less likely once S has passed, and 2N could gain in several ways. for example, it avoids a lead-directing 1H by W ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should the auction go 1C-P-1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand will be all about geting the spades right, and there are multiple options|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: How do you get the opps to break trumps for you on this hand?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: one possibility--though it will probably not be chosen for fear of ruffs and overruffs--is to play all the side suits and save trumps for last. most likely dec will attack spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right away. he could play ace and another or try for the intrsfinesse|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Simon late... go stand in corner|pg||
nt|mamos: this match must involve the some of the most experienced Women players in Europe|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still even tho he should still have pass that is not a 2@s bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: for their system it is|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see 10 tricks - in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: first to reach 5@D and second to make it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i woudnt recomend the 2 dia overcall, bec being vulnerble there is no chance for declaring this hand|pg||
nt|affe82: i 4@s hade @d 9 legat i disken efter 0.1 vilket gjort det kämpigt. om vi haller med generellt eller inte sa kan vi hursom inte klaga pa resultatet.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Det är inte lätt att ta reda på, men då gäller det ju att ta det beslutet som oftast är rätt, och det vågar jag nog ta gift på är hö-fråga i lagtävling|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3nt var ett bra resultat för NS, men vill tro att Berny kommer hamna i 3nt|pg||
nt|affe82: de kommer att ha tiden att välja rätt efter en @cl starkt. trolig push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
nt|pitiful:  we have a Roland slam now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Hans|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 tricks in @h for NS|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: coffee hand- at least should be|pg||
nt|arvidsson: du är en gambler du Micke :) vi kan sammanfatta att det är en fråga om stil nysan hamnade till slut i 4 @S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer inte att bli lätt för N/S att stanna under 4 @s här|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok west did discard a Heart so declarar made, did not even see that as an possibility|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hawe45:  Sorry @S...!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H two-suiter???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome simon|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh lol|pg||
nt|gohar: 2@s was not his bid i think,,,but they play like this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: standard bidding would be 4@D transfer, because 2@D 2@H 4@H would show slam interest|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Fast som en åskådare precis sa :) Kanske 3 NT igen, och denna gången är det verkligen rätt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: på denna gör man 3nt, men går det att bjuda ?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|shevek: 7-10(11) 5], not 4[|pg||
nt|xenya: unless something very unusual happened |pg||
nt|shevek: 5@h not 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very lucky diamonds for the declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am trying to make our operator insert a  D  in West's name|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: i had duties getting cereal bars for a certain D Gold|pg||
nt|Walddk7: TOWNSEND|pg||
nt|pitiful:  strong @c by south|pg||

nt|hawe45:  This should lead to an easy 4 @S|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|gohar: 4@s,,,,,makes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I allready se East lead the @D QUEEN..|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative lead by Fredin -- maybe now it's makeable? |pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems reop X would help East to visualize|pg||
nt|copeyj: although they can make 5@D too |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however still makes 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT is Relay I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  slam is likely to make if they get there|pg||
nt|eweber: NS plays a variable NT, NT opening nv 1st and 2nd seat 10-12|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: givetvis måste man gissa rätt i @C så ingen garanti att gå hem även om den bjuds|pg||
mb|p!|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be reluctant to pass this |pg||
nt|gohar: are u looking for an OT at 4@s?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently not for this pair|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 heart is funny in my eyes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: man får nog hemgången i utspelet i 3 nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårt utspel för Johan|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d looks to be a safer partial than 3@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Surprise...|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|gohar: :)yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om man gissar så  har S visad en svag 2:a I @S med minimum intervall|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i still think the score in board 1 is wrong|pg||
nt|shevek: we don't have a score in bd 1|pg||
nt|shevek: you mean bd 2 Vlad?|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 i meant|pg||
nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
nt|dimi: true Jan, strange most pairs have greements to show 4 card support after txf|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||
nt|ady: west has to legislate for a possible bust with east|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south did not feel obliged to cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Bosiger went -1......|pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket talar för trumf eller hj ut (A sitter troligen hos N) |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
nt|andreasw:  other table @c K wad the lead and a @h switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South knows that for Slam to be good she need a lot of cards from North|pg||
nt|eweber: the NS pair in the other room also plays "variable" as I just see, 14-16 in 1/2 nv and else 15-17 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  was*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The bidding: 1 @C pas 1 @S pass - 4 @S...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better than asking about this bidding, buy the book...!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: we know he has 8, but he does not|pg||
nt|haans: england can take it|pg||
nt|jallerton: they got there in the other room when W doubled 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak two in a major, 2@H/@S=two-suited|pg||
nt|haans: imagnative leads not succeeding are not popular|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry Bethe, welcome.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: will be there 3th match today|pg||
nt|haans: yep 9.30 13.00 16.15|pg||
nt|haans: central time|pg||
nt|haans: hi Jean|pg||
nt|mamos: and the Club weakness has been identified|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well swap south's minors and slam is ok|pg||
nt|mamos: just the trump Q to cause anxiety if EW cah clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how that beats 4@s|pg||
nt|gohar: cant|pg||
nt|hedyg: lose 2@cs and 1@D|pg||
nt|gohar: yes simple and straight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: någon som hade tänkt annorlunda (jag är fruktasnvärt dålig på otur, så försöker få lite tips)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No good lead for West|pg||
nt|affe82: not that I get the bidding but ending in the denomination and level that was expected.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
nt|mamos: cash|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done by east|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well-done - the worse lead possible ( J x x x ) was good this time|pg||
nt|affe82: my regular pd has forbidden me to ever lead that. so would have had a hard timing replicating W's good lead here.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C Queen - and @D to the Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Your regular partner is RIGHT!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how will u only loose 1@D?|pg||
nt|affe82: blir 11 här|pg||
pc|c7|nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
nt|eweber: no big surprise that they lead a club if 4@s and 5@d were cuebids|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
nt|gohar: irrespective of any lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I really hope, someting is going on - no declarer should use that time on an ordinary game contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @D-loser|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly dubinin dictated fine|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: EW cannot take many clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't know - but I can't believe E passed facing a strong @C unless it showed something|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d looser's?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i give 1 and i ruff 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W will over ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO @D-loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh true|pg||
nt|affe82: no it seems strange..|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gohar: yes straight hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck this and finish cross-ruffing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|affe82: a kibber suggest dropping @s J under A. might give decl a chance to go wrong. at least if on a later board he should get to do the same thing on JTx. kind of interesting play ...|pg||
nt|affe82: really.|pg||
nt|affe82: hans line is better. the drop will prob not happen.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - no line within some minutes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should - in my plan - the third @C be ruffed, you must try the finesse of the @D Jack|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, there is a typo in North's name.  EKREN|pg||
nt|andersk: Im not sure what vent wrong here. I like playing 3 @C over 1x-1y-2NT as search for info. Ekrens 4 NT I disagree with, 4333 and actually nothing good exsept for AK A|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To drop the @S Jack is a greek gift |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Walddk5: Reverse the  R and K|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: X=0-4, Pass=5-7 after 1C-(1x)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that makes sense, ty|pg||
nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|jallerton: As Ben points out, if  you X what if it goes 3C 3H to you?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: however that was far from clear|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this sort of hand, it is usually a good idea for north to be able to show shortage below game level|pg||
nt|affe82: this is taking forever. cannot really see why. was surprised earlier when russia-netherlands managed to incur 5VPs penalties eeach fro slow play. they are off to a good start ...|pg||
nt|affe82: repeating that here perhaps..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is a joke - restricted choice by West - come on|pg||
nt|affe82: the drop really does not put decl to more of a test. playing them small up achieves the same thing really.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What decl is thiunking about now, he should have decided before touching the @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andersk: 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensured 7 tricks.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No, they will play 4 @S - just like in bridge|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||

nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy 4 h here|pg||
nt|affe82: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After this critisable 2 @H-bid, itÂ´s a good slam|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|affe82: still earns them another imp I guess. altman's choice of 3n was a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, you can NOT ruff a @H - 4 @S is the spot|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now 4@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then 7 is on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c rkc|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now they bid slam|pg||
nt|affe82: so you don't see him go for the doublefinesse then? lol. no imps. you are right. 11.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy dia lead, quick claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 3 is positive|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en så kallad kaffebricka |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: notice that Jonsson did not bid after 1@D, almost making it impossible for Smirnov Piekarek to go plus (even 5@D will be hard to make without information)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South denied the @H-control - 650|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: inga konstigheter är övertricken vi spelar om här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: en typisk bricka som visar tydligt hur viktigt det är med anpassning|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hat to tell you, but 7 @S is ONLY 2.000 = gaining 5 IMP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@s?|pg||
nt|affe82: troliga 11. claim inom 4 stick?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Doubled -|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter now:(|pg||
nt|hawe45:   I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think he should have bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hade N haft omvänt i rödfärgerna hade han bjudit vidare efter S 2@d och då hade man också gjort slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej när spadern sitter snett ;) tror jag inte på claim :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: efter att man kollat så man har alla A förstås|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 11 med rätt giss i ruter, så kan bli en lång resa till 11 stick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know theyre system but must be void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tuff start at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H he can claim|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
nt|affe82: men när han kommer att spela @d sa gör han det till J och 11|pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om inte Cullin vänder i ruter (sista chansen till bet)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d showed a 4card mixed raise according to their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: no has to check @ds first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me east does not have a 3@d bid but it is much closer than the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll is going somewhere about three off so someone seems to have done tooo much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W may well be afraid of game bid next door|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: frankly this is rooutine defence for top class players but in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty gl there|pg||
nt|hedyg: seen much better Andi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|copeyj: 12 tricks in NT on non @D lead - and on a @D lead you will have to guess whether to play T or Q if played by South (solid played by N)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rnmalik: what happened is beyond me:) |pg||
nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u arent playing because ur needed as a coach|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i never have:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday in open Italy was ahead by 48:0|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after how many board's?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D precision style|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: east west may play 3 spades, will they get a chance to enter bidding?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: balanserar man på V?|pg||
nt|affe82: pass?|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|paulg:  could he not have just thrown dummy in?|pg||
nt|eweber: für die deutschen Zuschauer, die nicht gut englisch sprechen: Fragen Sie mich bitte, wenn Sie etwas nicht verstehen!|pg||

nt|affe82: nej|pg||
mb|3H|nt|shevek: 4-cards|pg||
nt|shevek: always unbalanced|pg||

nt|copeyj: this might have been a good board for england in the closed room|pg||
nt|copeyj: N opened 2@S (8-11)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: but the vulnerability persuaded tosh to try game|pg||
nt|lestergold: stout lads who is Marshall talking about cant be us Simon|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Elinescu may consider passing, facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ah he did|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja det var självklart :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|henryb:  given the result at the other table it cost only 1 imp to bid the game as opposed to stoppint liw|pg||
nt|mikael_w: återigen, en självklar balansering i partävling, i lagtävling är det nog mer en stilfråga|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
nt|mamos: three off turned out  to be optimistic|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w may well end up in 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: Cristina Giampietro and Pony Nehmert bid 1@s 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland said that is not a record|pg||
nt|affe82: another push. me I prefer 2@s forcing from Kirmse's hand. no trouble getting to the right spot here though.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|janhamhurg: not a good idea i thk, why not 2 dia or 1 no- because they are vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT natural with 4+ @d I believe|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They probably play the 2 @s-bid for a weaker hand|pg||
nt|affe82: oops. yet again I am lost.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous now - North must have promised a strong NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  See it fra South, North shall cover 4 out of 5 losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever 4 NT is - North must answer|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: men med NS i zonen är nog pass rätt i längden även i partävling|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||
nt|affe82: i am informed N has showed 14+ bal, might 4n have been quantitative?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  Italy'en team is *powning*:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gave the contract...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: partscores are not IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
nt|mamos: id expect South to bid 2@h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: tycker du det ? det tycker nog inte jag|pg||
nt|affe82: 630 prob. or am I to be surprised again?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be to much|pg||
nt|dimi: -1 likely outcome|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Magnusson meant 2@S as purely comp.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now they play 4- probably - 1, but makes if you find the club queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but Haraldsson expected perhaps a tiny bit more than this junkyard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a small @H - and South will play for the @C-finesse|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tycker att det är ett svårt läge, men zonerna hade hjort att jag passat i båda fallen|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
nt|affe82: personligen hade jag inte balanserat i ngn form. lite skräpigt.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still isnt a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good guessing in trumps helps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||

nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||

nt|pitiful:  was that really only 9 operator?|pg||
nt|dimi: oops|pg||
nt|Gerben42: revoke?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: yes, a chance for Sweden here|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|dimi: 2 revokes?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 12 imps away by a lack of concentration|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no revoke just the ten under the jack|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now its important to realize 15 more boards coming lots of chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: what misfits:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb coffee break|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for ew|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: miss click +1 sorry|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D sac optimal|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|copeyj: I would pass 3@C with the N hand i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: assuming this is weak jump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H equally good.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not sure what 2@S shows here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok it was a revoke then, the spade 10 on a club|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en intressant giv vi har framför oss, där man ska nå 5@C|pg||
nt|affe82: som är en off, väl?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5 @c hamnar man nog lätt i här. men det går kanske att spela hem också|pg||
nt|arvidsson: klart det går att lira hem|pg||
nt|affe82: kanske kan ns komma för högt i @h? 3@hX -1?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men sedan är frågan om det är troligt|pg||
nt|mikael_w: varför är det klart att det går hem ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: inte alls klart, men man kan gå hem|pg||
nt|mikael_w: precis :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what is wrong with 6@C, EW.|pg||
nt|benjy:  impossible in my view|pg||
nt|eweber: I have been told these sites work best with Internet Exlorer, some browsers refuse to show anything when you click on "playing record"|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Väljer man att spela på @d så löser det sig nog, |pg||
nt|affe82: tom -2 i @h.|pg||
nt|affe82: 4-0 gör det svart att hämta hem sticken.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Nu börjar det dock se jobbigt ut att nå 5 @c då varken Ö eller V har visat @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OPPERATOR ? are you sure this is right ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ser ut som ett väl hårt 1NT inkliv tycker jag :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||
nt|copeyj: so now I am sure Gromov will look for 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW doing what's right against pairs who mix it up like NS - just play their normal game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i dont like the 2 spade call- much to strong for me|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|dimi: i agree Jan|pg||
nt|Gerben42: me too - but NS like to mix it up, it's their style|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: and play 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting that perhaps both North and South were planning a leaping michaels bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes a great lead |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 5 card stayman, so 2@D showed 1+ 4cM, 2@S showed @H and no @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: is my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||
nt|copeyj: they both are|pg||
nt|haans: will E double|pg||
nt|mamos: it is difficult to describe such hands if you open 1@H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja inte var det blygt inte|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: Hi Mike and Rashed|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down?????????|pg||

pc|c7|nt|shevek: 4 imps to sweden|pg||

pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: The declarer has 10 tricks on the placement of cards.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: soon maybe a game?|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: you can make 3 spades or even 4 with a little def mistake|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's down on good defence -- no entry to dummy tio cash high club in time|pg||
pc|sK|nt|affe82: men med det utspelet blir det knappast mer än 100 ew. fortfarande bra bjudet.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eweber: Dhondy Senior regularly open NT with 5card Majors|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nu är frågan om inte Uppmark kan räkna in @d A hos Cullin|pg||
nt|mikael_w: efter budgivningen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: även om trumf ut inte var det bästa utspelet, men är det utspel som väldigt många hade valt|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|ady: Russia stayed out of slam on hand 5    played 3NT|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: web site for systems: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|shevek: has to switch to @d|pg||

nt|haans: easy defense now|pg||
nt|haans: easy?????????????|pg||
nt|affe82: ?an är väl om han hittar cullins @s J för coopen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att underspela spader Q  för 2 bet|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: This is very delicate for declarer.  He can draw two round of trumps and ruff two clubs in dummy.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect at least 2 missed slams for any team in 20 boards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: or spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  I've only played against Fredin a couple of times, but he is one of the more imaginative that I've seen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bra utspel och en trolig bet att vänta|pg||
nt|arvidsson: kan lätt bli -2 då kommunikationen inte är den bästa (lätt att få till två @H till försvaret) om S lägger i K som exempel|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var inte lätt att gå hem ändå, det vimlar inte av ingångar på´S för att spela @h|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|d9|nt|arvidsson: nej nu blev det 2 bet|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-no - West can see, that they have an 8-card fit in @H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: i went through the play - wasnt that clear to guess it - but he made it :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4@S bid opposite the vuln preempt showed good judgement|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and trust!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unfortunately @CAKQ was opposite the singleton and break 5-2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: still makes 10 trick ace of dia is well|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Bernard Ludewig|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||
nt|jfaria: now easy ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps wanted another club for a double?|pg||
nt|ludewig: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: nicely avoided @d lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: 6@d has a double dummy solution|pg||
nt|copeyj: two imps to Russia here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: spader var enklare att spela, men då det är Belgien som spelför är vi inte lässna för det|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dimi: hi Bernard|pg||
nt|affe82: @s var bättre. särskillt som den landar pa rätt hand|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: hi bernhard|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|Gerben42: good morning|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|haans: nowdays they open on nothing|pg||
nt|haans: close but no cigar|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a number will have opened the West hand in these championships with A, AK|pg||
nt|haans: Mandatory said Culbertson|pg||
nt|haans: and agree|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ive been looking at scores instead of bridge :(    sorry|pg||
nt|arvidsson: @C J var ett viktigt kort att ha som S :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: dessutom tycker jag S hade ett självklart 1 @s bud på I @h|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag håller med om att man borde bjuda @S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  Townsend, who used to be known as 'Young Tom' at my local club, has become more conservative with age|pg||
nt|haans: we all start young|pg||
nt|paulg:  he has also won more medals with this style :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodvenn: Here in Ostend there have been manye technical start up problems.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eweber: someone says the links there don't work, with Internet Explorer they do|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D is onside but declarer getting awfully short vs the 4-1 break|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vbman: pulling ahead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no problem that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: a couple of overtricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|affe82: jag gillade raisen. lite svag för att priffa senare. de kan spela det som bättre kort.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag antar att öppningshanden kan ha 5@h och 4@s ? och det kostar ju ingenting då man alltid kan bjuda @h på lägsta nivå nästa gång|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Gerben42: no entry @DK wins and now has to ruff again!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a dia|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  Ruff - and endplay South in @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodvenn: you may not have heard that the Norwegian women's team played a draw against Lebanon. But...|pg||

nt|haans: OPERATOR Whats happening?|pg||
nt|jfaria: another easy one :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Germany on the board, when Iceland correctly defended with 4@S they took the push in 5@H and made it with dbl|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: starting with overruffing and play dia woul help- but decl didnt know 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|affe82: mot en slask@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @D lean + @H to ace + @CA discarding @D+ play spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: It would be a good match, probably the match.|pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  strong @c by north|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||

nt|affe82: eller @c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 5 @C går bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: no finesse in OR|pg||
nt|haans: more than 50% |pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodvenn: tounrament director, and make them go thru the boards one by one. |pg||
nt|andersk: jeez....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in the end they accepted that it was a draw|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand:)|pg||
nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: second excellent board from piekarek-smirnov|pg||
nt|ludewig: they may try 4@S again|pg||
nt|arvidsson: så det hoppas vi inte på :)|pg||
nt|affe82: sant. hjärnis. :)|pg||

nt|arvidsson: svårt att läsa innantill|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Disciplined NOT 1 @S from Michael - good bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N is roughly 21-22 for Gold/Townsend (1@C opener can include balanced 20)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c big there, m i alone ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just borrowed one HCP|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gromov spicing things up a bit with a delayed 3N overcall here :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: good job by GeO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  1N showing @c by south I assume, FG|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: super accept.|pg||
nt|haans: imps at right side?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More discipline - South also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 tricks should be possible|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||
nt|copeyj: although perhaps the operator misscored the last board - looks like 11 tricks only?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i dont want a @c lead!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with passed pd, another "weak jump overcall", agree with 2@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D over 1@C is annoying for opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@H fit jump even more so|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and go down in 4 spade- but now 4 dia will make |pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@D makes after a Club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player in discussion|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D looks like final contract now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no alert i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: although it may be "general bridge logic" to bid 3@H only with fit, I still think one should alert it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 3 hearts is a fit jump east might bid 3 spades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: eller det sticket får vi ändå, men snyggare|pg||
nt|mikael_w: risk för trumfutspel dock :(|pg||
nt|affe82: det kommer man väl att göra? @c ut?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: -3 om inte spelföraren hittar hj sitsen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh, det är syd som spelar :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte riktigt att vi kommer hitta att angripa hj så tidiigt:) |pg||
nt|mikael_w: borde faktiskt vara ett ganska lätt @h utspel eller ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: td asking from sweden|pg||
nt|affe82: även med trumf lead hinner försvaret testa aallt för att hitta stölden, väl?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||
nt|haans: then you are in 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: acceptance from W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guys - today is a "short" day - 1 or 2 matches only|pg||
nt|eweber: I think 1NT is just and relay without 4M|pg||

nt|hedyg: voila! he has kept them out of game?|pg||

nt|hedyg: could be weak, like 9-10 hcps|pg||

nt|hawe45:  2 NT will go down, South has NO reason to guess the @S-position|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|christinas: 2@c is stayman with the intention of follow up with 2! which is invitational|pg||

nt|lestergold: well flat thankfully for england dont think they can afford any more adverse swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s is not a great contract tho especially non vul-|pg||
nt|lestergold: neeeds 2 out of three fimnesses and a 2/1 spade break more or less|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodvenn: the problem is if dummy is forced |pg||
nt|rodvenn: before the spades is established|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after so many " @s " bids, will W lead this suit?|pg||
nt|mamos: it's amazing how little help so many CCs are|pg||

nt|hedyg: sry 11|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They have their fun here...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: @H entry to be removed|pg||

nt|hedyg: for minors?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|pelu: short of entries - better to play @S now|pg||

nt|arvidsson: om Ö har kort hj vill man det :)|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|mamos: Nevena   knows whats she wants to happen|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Best defence = one more @C|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: He has 9 tricks on @S guess.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: How +@@?|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks??|pg||
nt|xenya: where did he find them?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: which would also ave appeaered if Berset had taken the ace of h first.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yup here we go|pg||
nt|copeyj: another good denmark result from the open room|pg||
nt|mamos: scores from the other room seem to have stopped|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good guessing here, if you want to bid - and win - a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: ännu en bricka med kamp om kontraktet|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: +2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would expect the last board to be a swing to England|pg||
nt|eweber: did everyone hear that the Open match Sweden England is going to be repeated today because teams played on the wrong axis (both English NS, both Swe EW)?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  North will open 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: Roland deal here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|jfaria: 4@s are playable ..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another "Burger King opening" (over 1 zillion served), as Meckstroth describes it|pg||
nt|ludewig: finally a part score hand|pg||
nt|affe82: 4@c ser ut att vara en god sac mot 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Iceland playing 4@S X in open room  8|pg||
nt|haans: assume trash|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|xenya: most likely, 2@H was down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  could be repeated here double is normal holding two bullets opposite an opener|pg||
nt|jfaria: but doubt they will reach it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h is a good spot here|pg||
nt|eweber: such things happen, but I am amazed that no one realized when it happened in the vugraph!|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt want to bid 1NT with xx in @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT OK with me here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 3nt look's fair enough to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: although looks like 11 tricks so maybe england got away lightly|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|h_karluk: i would pass to 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: they did |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very, how missed. May be difficult to bid with N hand.|pg||
nt|ludewig: actualy 3 NT is good|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so a bad result from germany in number 7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: down 3 in a 3 no contract gives 5 imps to iceland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm surprised that Alex passed that rather than a weak 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but I know they have very strict standards for 2-bids|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S is NOT everybodyÂ´s taste, might play a strong @C-system|pg||

nt|paulg:  Fredin-Fallenius provide 20 pages of notes|pg||

mb|4S!|nt|mdgraham: 1@S=game invitational or better, relay|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would pass 1 spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why did not rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 hearts now- any extras you see in that hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7, 5@C -1, @S wrong guess.|pg||
nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria: fiendly lead|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lestergold: has pros and cons i admit.... passing or bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H = transfer|pg||
nt|Gerben42: important to note that Magnusson did not bid 3@H - remember the saying " only monkey climb alone"|pg||
nt|affe82: gar väl hem tom. sa det kanske det kan bli. svart att komma dit nu dock|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: not much point in ducking here|pg||
nt|xenya: so two boards now seem to have been misscored: 2 and 8  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: agree Mike, pass to 1@s sound|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will North lead 4th best @S...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: makes the work easy.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace and @D to the 10|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hans he cannot see the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No - but he needs 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he can try:p|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 26 of them|pg||
nt|arvidsson: kan spelas hem, men inte självklart (4@C) dvs bra bjudet av EW här, men jag var aldrig orolig|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exciting now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All depends of the trump-play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: west probably backs in if u pass but unlikely they have a game and more likely u get into trouble bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see no reason for the winning @S-finesse, sorry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|shevek: not much point in winning either :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why in @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds and 1@h is enough|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: 11 toptricks - time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Sweden :)|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally and Nicola have won 12 Imps by pushing Cristina and Pony to 5 in board 6|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bu what a lucky @D-position|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andersk: -1, good result for NS here! As the layout is, 3 NT makes EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defense another @C|pg||
nt|haans: no guess at or|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or club?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: thsi room|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Please tell how 2@H made 9 tricks on board 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i agree its controversial but here you have a misfit and the heart suit and a k makes it unlikely not impossible that oppos have a game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Down 1 much more likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no sorry|pg||
nt|jallerton: North did well to make it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)or 1@d and 2@h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  By taking the @cÂ´s he will get discard-problems himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he has killed communications|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: contract starts to look better- but not enough to make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: trash may end you in 4-3 instead of 5-3|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was why I recommended to play at least a RED suit from dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: the point has been mentioned|pg||
nt|shevek: south upgraded his 19hcp to 20.... so we know whom to blame|pg||
nt|haans: ,|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|nt|haans: now can geuss wrong in @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NL has 130VPs as compared to Sweden's 110, so far.|pg||
nt|haans: easier to finesse|pg||
nt|haans: small to A one way|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhh not @d to the 10?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But till to make - @H to the 10...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: i know nothing abt gold-townsend CC|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: @S or various other hands |pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says TRF after 1M-1N.  I don't understand 3@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: am guessing here that Gold has shown the shape he held|pg||
nt|h_karluk: count me in pls|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have their system file let me have a look|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jfaria: standard handling of @d = 11 tricks|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|jallerton: what is trash?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: a thank you|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  garbage stayman|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: bidding 2@C not invite but pass as soon as possible|pg||

nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: we all been there|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, the difference was the initial pass by E|pg||

mb|2D|nt|lestergold: no heartb lead will make ten tricks inpractice|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, about the right time here:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: West has opened 1N here|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: sudi: 5@H is on so sac 6@d not so profitable... Me give opps 5 level|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - 3 NT was a normal shot|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think its hard to make 6 hearts|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he doesnt like his hand so much|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D down 2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now x would be great|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 6 @S should go down after a club lead, so no slam after all|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder how they got the 12th trick|pg||
nt|pelu: no beer for me to day - to morrow morning I am going by car to Oostende :(|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H showed 6@S minimum or 16+ with @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: when he continued with 3@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a good beginning is half a succession|pg||
nt|copeyj: he showed 5-3-1-4 and a good hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm the hackett vulnerable barrage on the ew/ cards in the open room does not look very sound lucky only one off|pg||

pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: We have a very generous operator.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i mean neither of their buids would have been my choice|pg||

nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||

nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||

nt|haans: 7@S?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 7@s Very optimistic|pg||
nt|haans: agree but (swede)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far EW here can be very happy with their card|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: I hate singleton K and Q - but still I would open 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: with the !K in her hand known after playing the Q earlier, @c K was the best she could try|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is were S should bid 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: probably EW will try 4 @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ser ut som en delis, 2 @s borde väl bli slutbudet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hur många spader bjuder man på S?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3 ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 !!!|pg||
nt|affe82: haller med. slow-slow-slow här med @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@D negative from Gromov i expect|pg||
nt|copeyj: on board 10 (just played)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: England are playing 3@H undoubled in the open room|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 down|pg||
nt|jfaria: "4@s whatever u got"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a straight-forward 4 @H here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big swing for Germany - the made the slam in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and 9 imps to England (much needed)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Man har 6 förlorare och fi har bjudit och partnern sagt pass, varför skall man hoppa till 3 då ?'|pg||
mb|4H|nt|shevek: 1@d = nat ALWAYS unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: 6@d anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: i like it|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 sorry|pg||
nt|arvidsson: för att inte ge fi chansen att hitta sin färg|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: disciplined partnerships mahy handle it|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 AND NO PLAY FOR 3n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Non Ace@C lead makes 4@S.|pg||
nt|copeyj: combined 24 i think mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 17 opp 7 isnt it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 24 i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure why 1@S alerted.  Card suggests 1@S is nat, <GF|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has bad values, no thinking about a slam, not at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gold is not passing this, just considering best way forward|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has bid 4@s opposite that|pg||
nt|affe82: med andra hö hade jag haft förstaels för 3. (även över 2@d)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better to get 420|pg||
pc|s3|nt|shevek: I wonder why south didn't cue @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: hearts|pg||
nt|haans: 5-6?|pg||
nt|haans: what did 21Hx show?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wont make with a normal dia lead, unless you guess the spade suit|pg||
nt|arvidsson: känsligt kontrakt för ÖV 9 stick kommer det troligen att sluta med (även om försvaret kan beta)|pg||
nt|affe82: ser ut som att detta gar att pilla hem.|pg||
nt|affe82: nja. han kan väl alltid ga hem om han stjäl högt och fiskar med @dT  pa vägen tillbaks?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: spader A sedan mera spader för att stjäla högt och maska ? |pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||
nt|eweber: y, there you are right, but who would seeing a doubleton in dummy and the chance to overruff in @s?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|shevek: 3@d should set the trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: now here is a hand i specialise in|pg||
nt|copeyj: playing in 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c in the German system askes for 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess Dubinin draw the big picture and respected captaincy|pg||
nt|paulg:  second double would normally be a strongish takeout|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d shows a doubleton @h?|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@d say no|pg||
nt|ludewig: 4@S needs to play Spades for no losers|pg||
nt|affe82: enligt den tidigare diskussionen hade jag dock inte skämtsw för att bjuda 3@s över 3@d. men ni övriga kanske inte haller med?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej bjuder man 2 spader har man gjort sitt, tycker man får välja i första varvet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: då jag hade bjudit 3 spader (som troligen är ett rätt dåligt bud)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: troligen kommer Uppmark att spela kl från bordet|pg||
nt|mikael_w: svårt tycker jag, men jag hade aBSOLUT NÖJT MIG MED 2 @S FÖRSTA GÅNGEN, SEDAN OM MAN BJUDER 3 OCKSÅ SÅ BÖRJAR DET JU LUKTA LITE DUBBLINGSFARA NÄR DET SITTER DÅLIGT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: they seem to get there anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: slam rates to go down though -- on the surface|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @c lead declarer has to guess @ss|pg||
nt|haans: 5@c AND WAIT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norge slapp unna en katastrofe i det andre rommet.Boye doblet 4 hj og islendingene rettet til 4sp|pg||
nt|rodvenn: fortsatt spill 8|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S could be 3 @S|pg||
nt|ludewig: North will proabably try to punch dummy with diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  the redouble said 'bid your suit'|pg||
nt|jallerton: Oh sorry I am asleep|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a method close to my heart|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
nt|eweber: if I remember correctly and they still play like this|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he is playing for 0 losers needs to start with @SQ|pg||
nt|ludewig: now he wishes he had played 3 NT|pg||
nt|dimi: true, he playing for @s 10 doubleton ...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: which is the wrong percentage play- to be honest gerben|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SQ wins whenever KT onside or T singleton behind|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: blir N skvisad nu?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: but he doesnt know about @H yet|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jallerton: has to run this, I assume|pg||
nt|haans: IMPs right i assume|pg||
nt|paulg:  as happened to Scotland's women in the previous match, bidding a thin grand slam when the opposition are only in game is not a winning formula|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so wasnt clear to go for 0 losers in @S|pg||
nt|arvidsson: mina partners brukar vara så snälla att fortsätta med ytterligare spader :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hQ|nt|haans: ot is double unlucky|pg||
nt|mikael_w: DET ÄR BARA ATT KASTA @C|pg||
nt|arvidsson: så att man får chansen att göra fel|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oj då. kaps lock gjorde sitt :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and loses to kx onside and kxx|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men spader 4 borde vara tillräckligt med hjälp|pg||
mc|9|nt|andersk: as I predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: @c had to be 2-2, so @S J quite safe|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: (it*)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what safety play?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, no, s can split the 2nd round of @hs. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: small sington in N more likely than singleton honor. if you start with top trump you fail when N has small stiff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 4N was KC, why did E bid again? is director attable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W apparently thinking about 6N|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznp: no director|pg||

nt|rnmalik: It was an observation after seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|paulg:  is this going to be a match of two halves?|pg||
nt|affe82: njet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att johan duckade ytterligare 1 spader var om N även hade kl A dvs AK och hj längden|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej kontraktet gick troligen 1 bet|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ytterligare en riktigt rolig hand kommer här|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still better with 420, which will be the score in the other room|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: Sorry-connection problem.|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so you compare kx onside with 10x offside- thats about 50 50|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
nt|dimi: NS will try 3nt on this one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
nt|ludewig: try and make|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok kanske var för att få S att lägga ner kl A :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but the essential point is that you dont knwo your @S goal without knowing if you lose @HK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: får många kloka tips om att N måste ha några HP för sin budgivning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ser ut som att 6 @h är ett bra kontrakt, men det kanske kan finnas fällor i det också|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fair slam here - good chances with @H 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d is wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||

mb|5S|nt|andyv:  Kxx in E hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so is my grade in german:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer aldrig gå att få stopp på S med den handen och partnern hoppar|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
mb|5N|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
nt|dimi: no road to fail|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 @h går nog alltid hen även om det sitter dåligt|pg||
nt|affe82: daligt?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 6@H om det bjuds kommer att gå hem, därför hoppas vi på att de bjuder 6nt :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: med @d utspel, så kan speföraren ta utspetel och spela @h, men duckar V då och S spelar en @h till så är j|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ruter sitter dåligt, spadern sitter sjukt bra|pg||
nt|mikael_w: går det nog bet om V tar och fortsätter med @h|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej spader J sitter 3:e|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
mb|6H|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1o tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but germany is far behind now in the match, and i woudnt call that unlucky|pg||
nt|arvidsson: varav det alltid står|pg||
nt|mikael_w: du har bara 3 sak, du kanske sakar en @d och slår en @s-mask|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Singel @d ut så kommer det ofta att gå bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: varför då?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja hur hade du spelat efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte han kommer att lägga ner några ruter, men visst det kan hända|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det handlar inte om att lägga ner, hur spelar ni efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag stväl på handen spelar hj Q|pg||
nt|affe82: duck. @h. be till gud.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: stjäl |pg||
nt|arvidsson: sedan är det rulltårta :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nej det är det inte|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jo det är det 2 ingångar @H K samt @S Q kan stjäla upp rutern om jag vill då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men som sagt sitter trumfen 4-1 kan det bli jobbigt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No trump-lead this time, Michael|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mikael_w: stjäla upp @d ? skojar du?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, you might play a @H to the 10|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag kan stjäla upp rutern om jag villl, hade jag gjort det ja|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lite beroende på vad som händer tidigare när jag spelar hj J |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
nt|affe82: riskerna är väl: @h A kan ge @d stöld. men mest 4-1 i trumf. annars kan man enligt arvidssons linje dra trumf och ruffa 2@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: duckar de och jag spelar hj mot K |pg||
nt|mikael_w: så i stick 2 spelar du !q och efter duck även @h J då. men då vet jag inte om du spelat med oddsen|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||

nt|eweber: following links from the official result page you can reach that one to see what is going on on board 12 at the other tables|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another 7 imp's gained this match is almost over|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even Ottmar Hitzfeld would bid 1 @D as West|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam time|pg||
nt|dimi: hopefully the German soccer team will perform slightly better in a few hours :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men intresserad att höra vad som är med oddsen ? |pg||
nt|arvidsson: med ruterutspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men då går du bet när @d uppför sig och @h sitter 4-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  strong @c|pg||
nt|eweber: right, but Sabine and Dany can be slow when interesting hands come up|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is not a 3@h opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but difficult after 1 @H opening by East|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s 1 @H - no more, no less|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  10 : Iceland made 11 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they are lucky - they dont play vs iceland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Germany really needs some good boards if they want at least to be in 2 digits|pg||
nt|ludewig: and another slammish hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if i had 1 bid only it would be 6 clubs:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja absoult, men ruter ut talar väl mer för att rutern sitter snett än att hj gör det ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag säger inte att jag har facit, bara att jag tror att det kan gå bet med @d utspel om man väljer fel spelsätt|pg||
nt|affe82: eller bada.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Quite normal 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: both vul and weak NT in action|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15 the deficit and 8 boards to go so eng still has chacne to reverse this|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  S hand looks like a 1N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: deficit|pg||
nt|jfaria: those hands are tricky, 8 hc points and a void... facing 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@h cannot be beaten|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu wont like 2@S behind his @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: will this end in 2@SX e/w? that would not be pleasant for them|pg||
nt|jallerton: the Sweded missed a decent game in the other room|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pelu: Operator - I know it is diff - but dont claim 10 tricks when opp has taken 4 tricks, pl :)|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: but 6 club is better, but since 2 keycard are missing 6 isnt an option i thk|pg||
nt|arvidsson: väldigt få brickor som är självklara, oftast brukar man finna någon dålig variant att spela på, men finns en anledning varför jag inte spelar utan sitter här och kommenterar|pg||
nt|affe82: med en gynsam @s sits. var väl även linjen med vinst(kasta @c) liten hj. kassaskap? kan fa en giss om maska med @h8 när en hypotetisk E vinner @h k med A..|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H is lay-down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 sp is -1 only|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or - 2 if a ruff comes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||

nt|affe82: westerlund bör som jag lära sig att sitta pa verandan. da behöver man inte ga ifran oavsett begär.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||

nt|andreasw:  unless|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Hans and Specs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry always -2|pg||

nt|mikael_w: trumfspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BRB|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
nt|ludewig: South shows some club support, he did not bid 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a kibitz says pass over 4 spade would have been forcing- im not so sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  He would open 1 NT also wit a 4-card @D - and here he has two more tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hm ett bra kontrakt landade de i, vågar vi hoppas på spader ut och sedan hj till A och mera hj ? så det blir en snabb resa tillö hemgång|pg||
nt|affe82: visst @h A som det sitter. det blir jobbigt om w startade med 9xxx och E med Asingel.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open 1 @D and jump to 2 NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CX+1 is more than slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1400 vs 1370|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that scores well no sos on level 5:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX I mean|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CXX+1 , without redouble slam is more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is north thinking? if he bids i leave:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: north and east are on 1 side - operator enters two bids at the time|pg||
nt|ludewig: the operator puts in bids for N and E at the same time, so East is thinking I think|pg||
nt|dimi: E will not feel comfortable|pg||
nt|Gerben42: East just showed support in an auction in which opps are strong |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: N is thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ska fi spela massa trumf på oss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Dear collegue - 4 @H lay-down = 10 tricks, they will regret, that they didÂ´nr RD|pg||
nt|Gerben42: woww|pg||
nt|arvidsson: som det sitter, men hoppas på att de attackerar hj s¨vi går hem|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bra trumfvända från S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1130 against possible 1370|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be the start of a German comeback?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its not that easy- we will see|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: yeh hearts is hard work tho shouldmake|pg||
nt|haans: even today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-oh - only 600...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men fortfarande hemma (då inget kan hota en stöld)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So "WE" get 11 IMP|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on this lead can make all tricks even... 1800|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we see 13 tricks, but imagine cl 3-1 and king of hearts offside|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
nt|dimi: One swallow does not make a summer ...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i doubt that that is an english saying----|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: update on board  10 - apparently the table result was 5@S making, but score adjusted by director to 5@H-1 ; Germany can appeal until 30 minutes after end of match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: reason for adjustment was a break in tempo (BIT) from Elinescu|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: now a promotion?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for laydown|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Gerben42: the play did seem irregular on  10 - now we know why|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now he needs cl 22 and heart 22- not sure that line was best|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|jfaria: small plus for NL|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: he does not 50% of time 2|pg||
nt|haans: is it time ti think now?|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, he might play clubs from the top, then try for some endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: very obscure, all that|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 11 Cullin bid 6@d|pg||
nt|xenya: lead?|pg||
nt|shevek: @d|pg||
nt|haans: thats why we are leading am never we if they are losing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible, really Jansma played @d7?|pg||
nt|affe82: andra rummet valde den olyckliga linjen med jämn @d sits. kostade dyrve.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: faran är om Cullin försöker resa ytterligare ett ruterstick|pg||
nt|arvidsson: dvs spela på kl 3-1 ruter 4-2|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4-3|pg||
nt|arvidsson: då hj sitter som  den gör resulterar det en bet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: genom att stjäla spadern och ruter till stöld|pg||
nt|arvidsson: som är rätt spelföring om kl sitter 3-1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|xenya: so a nice pick-up for Sweden|pg||

nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hard to reach a club contract- weired x here, their style i thk to x with 15 +|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|affe82: men den sista 5an maste vara en felscoring. tror det star 34-24, väl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag är inne på din linje fredrik borde vara 24-24|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 34-24|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
nt|dimi: EW can make 4@h if they get everything right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They need nothing right - at least  10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: bra spelat av S som lägger @s K här :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
nt|dimi: doctores are not that brave today|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Allt för att ge sken av att han har 2 st @h så att V skall ducka när @h spelas mot bordet|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men denna gången spelar det ingen roll när V har ALLT i @h|pg||
nt|affe82: bra offring ock|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|eweber: good defense against a making 3@d contract :)|pg||
nt|mamos: must take diamonds now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
nt|mamos: :(|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||
nt|ludewig: unspectacular 1 down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: live scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm - note that the women have the morning off|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its hard to play 3 matches a day- against tough opponents- so you lose concentration sometimes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 1 convention I realy dont like. thats the 1NT Forcing - dont hear me, if u like that convention :):)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  Dubinin really taking this long?  unusual for him.|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: settling for 10 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: yes, once the team mates sit the same way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly but lead was good. Kept E thinking.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: really 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: mot 3spader tänkte du då?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good and fast bid 6 @D here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 3 imps if 4@s made exactly|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes here also 2@H= 5@H +4m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ?!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pelu: transfer to @S (4+) could have a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South likely to bid 2@S - unless 3@D would be a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the hand is a bit weak for that action|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just trying to help Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: 5 Imps for GER in board 10, Sally bid 2NT vs this wk2 on @h 10xxxxxx, ending up in 3@sX for 800|pg||
nt|mamos: id guess that germany are winning the match at the moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asks|pg||
nt|affe82: sry. sant.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South undeterred.... |pg||
nt|andyv:  good call, Mike|pg||
nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
nt|affe82: missade 44an i @h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing @S or @C and @D I guess :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  200 % - wo wohnst Du (ruhig, Ich komme nicht...?)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What does 3 @D mean - with so good cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||
nt|paulg:  but that is probably why I'm commentating|pg||
mb|3H|nt|shevek: half way!|pg||

nt|shevek: have fun everyone|pg||

nt|ady: 2NT   leb?|pg||
nt|lestergold: leb?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D = pass with minors, bid 6@S otherwise|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men lätt hänt att det slinker hem i 4 spader|pg||
nt|affe82: tack eric. alltid med aom en räddare.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Bye Nicoleat seen you again|pg||
nt|shevek: bye now|pg||

nt|haans: Nicoleta|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Nicoleta, thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would 2 @S mean after 2 @H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all makes sense now, in a crazy way|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great lead!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad timing for the agressive move by W|pg||
nt|ludewig: over 1@S from S nobody would bid less than 4 or maybe 5NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East also bids West cards - I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The ending of thos match will be very bad for Slovakia - very expensive, and Germany needs it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With such a good hand, West should - having passed - bid 3 @H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det här ser ut som ett sterilt kontrakt, när @h sitter så här|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: psychologically +1000 +800 will do the Germans well|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but its hard to stop below 5 clubs- so the gain might be just 300|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in std system the auction might go: 1@S (2NT) pass (3@D) ; 3@H (4@C) Dbl end|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 10 enkla kommer det nog att bli|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janhamhurg: not with 7-6 gerben!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bidding 4@C voluntarily on this auction surely shows my hand with pd promising nothing|pg||
nt|ludewig: the other table is in 5D with S to bid (after 1Club - 4NT)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a spade is best|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: might be - 5 now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Efterssom Björn Fallenius är här inne och tittar nu också så passar vi naturligtvis på att gratulera till mycket bra spel såhär långt :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja ser väldigt stabilt ut, tur man han med och lägga en liten slant på betfair|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: this hand is a trap for all EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all clear now- so he will play a dia|pg||
nt|ludewig: same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp. after strong @C from S, West will be motivated to push higher|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far scores on  15 range from 1100 NS to 1700 EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: perfect defence will give germany some needed imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: make that +2200 to -1700|pg||

mb|2C|nt|pelu: I have seen that the match in Women: Israel - Libanon didnt start - we had that problem 10 years ago - but I hoped that sport now overruled politic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold slam|pg||
nt|jfaria: OK a good strugle now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have saved a trick drawing a trump at the end|pg||
nt|ady: grand here|pg||
nt|ady: but on heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sweden are recovering at a pace that could lead to a win|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||
nt|mamos: not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mamos: shed have preferred oppo to open 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland in it therefore|pg||
nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42: reward for a most quiet auction goes to Jansma - Paulissen|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
nt|arvidsson: borde vara enkel att bjuda|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
nt|dimi: 12 imps, nice |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S (2NT) p (p); 3@H (4@C) X end - 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - rebid of J 7 5 3 2 - call a doctor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: enkel att bjuda, men skall spelas hem också :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårigheterna är att visa upp singel ruter och bra spader|pg||
nt|mikael_w: krävs väl rättgiss i @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should naturally bid 2 @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela hem denna tror jag de klarar|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej de kastar en hj på kl|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: krävs uttrumfning|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, såg inte att det var AK på bordet :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a @D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||
nt|vasmar: not yet :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: mariani maschera la Dama..|pg||
nt|rialc2: Carlo nasconde la Q di @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx to all has been great  and thx to our operater Thierry for doing a great Job bye everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Andi :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||
nt|toniemme: now low club for not easy defense..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will not find it|pg||
nt|toniemme: 4@C 4@S 1ruf and 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: count to 10 and play small @c|pg||
nt|dimi: this will make |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|arvidsson: nu kan man göra storslam med rätt giss i hj :) |pg||
nt|mikael_w: japp :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: visste väl att gissen var viktig :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  also his redouble on the first board was not a roaring success|pg||
nt|affe82: operator: did EW really go down in 3@c on board..|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  that promotes 3rd trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|nt|xenya: will be over soon|pg||
nt|vasmar: no need for 5 since there is a discard|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C 16+|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you cash @SKQ you will have 4 tricks but give up any chance for a 5th|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: but now its also easy|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: claim now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 down now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|nt|vasmar: ana safety play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: positional factor works well there|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eweber: nice defense again|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|pauleger: so 10 more imps to Germany|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|toniemme: nice play from south..10@S very important card..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had a chance ruffing 1@H with K@s and playing @s to squeeze N before playing @c|pg||

nt|andyv:  have to bid those slams|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that will be a slightly fortuitous 13 imps to england|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not good|pg||
nt|haans: best sqz when only overtricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 more boards and new leader the netherlands|pg||
nt|vasmar: even 7@C is a good sacrifice over 6@S|pg||
nt|eweber: it is a pleasure to watch this match|pg||
nt|affe82: 13?|pg||
nt|affe82: 4@c I meam..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||
nt|copeyj: X from Townsend showing 4+@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were missing 2 K |pg||
nt|ady: twins got into bother on jand 15   plaued 4@HX    losy 500 and 7 imps|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: good choice|pg||
nt|jfaria: 2@c precision style|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here again the last 2@c trend|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: es|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|affe82: thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 3@H just what Haraldsson was hoping to hear|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Där vi kan följa running scores står det också 37-29 så då stämmer det säkert|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a huge hand for 10-12 NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: England are hurting|pg||
nt|lestergold: regret that i must leave now thx to my excellent fellow commentators well played Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good news for West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems popular in nowadays|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: all sweden happy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jfaria: Jan chooses the 8 card fit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: invitational jump shift|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||
nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3NT seems to have a shot though|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||
nt|jfaria: he can now|pg||
nt|haans: a Gazzilli variation |pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror på hemgång fortfarande|pg||
nt|arvidsson: denna bricka kommer gå bet|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dimi: not the best lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: now they can play nt|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with this bid yes, 6@H maked on Double @D finesse for EW. 5@H always there.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: sorry, I must leave too - I have a bridge match|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om försvaret hittar att angripa hj|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodvenn: so Iceland got to Lightner double 6! played from West. 1 down|pg||
nt|pauleger: @c lead would have been best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Simon, thanks operator - and well done to Denmark|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: @CJ right|pg||
nt|andersk: and Norway stoped in 5@S on the next slam, as we predicted|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is a funeral|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course also very well done by Iceland!|pg||
nt|andersk: we still miss board 13 here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, seems unlikely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: makes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  almost looks like one round of bidding is missing|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend trying for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: my kind a play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: maybe South bid 3NT and North corrected?|pg||
nt|rmb1: England regain the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: just one off|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam and grandslam difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: edge intom it rather than leap|pg||
nt|copeyj: but dont think he can|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will make with @sK onside|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  that would seem to be normal|pg||
nt|haans: now thay have a little talk|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: no: 3@S by N = 3+ @S - System note 14 :):))|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the way Iceland bid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thierry, the way the game goes on "Movie" its imposible 4 @c was down 1? Was there a wrong claim or something ?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: safe now|pg||
nt|ludewig: every lead gives a trick except Spade jack|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|rodvenn: where is trick 9?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: IMP are not like MP|pg||
nt|eweber: North has already shown 11 HCP, making it easy to know that all Qs are in S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vasmar: he plays safely to ruff 4th spade if they split 4-2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pauleger: operator, pls check the score of bd 16 - with that line of play it was -3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|eweber: so a club will be safe to reach the hand again later, if necessary|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodvenn: the club return from West made communication difficult for Ekren|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mikael_w: OPERATOR ?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep but no comments:) K@S scores at 4@S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a passive @D lead would have been more challenging, but i think declarer can survive even then|pg||
nt|copeyj: a strong @C for Gromov this time|pg||
nt|copeyj: as we discovered before, pass from Dubinin shows 5-8|pg||

mb|2D|nt|haans: scoring still not perfect|pg||
nt|jfaria: 2@d must show majors, i think|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think a conservative bid by w|pg||
nt|haans: Witch was invented by two swedish ladies 10 years after Gazzilli was invented|pg||
nt|eweber: just got a hint from a spectator, there was a way to beat it 2 times|pg||
nt|Gerben42: transfer responses to 1@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|pauleger: okay thx Thierry|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 2-way checkback, transfer|pg||
nt|affe82: ah! sämre.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: I think Gold is scared that they may have missed a game and doesnt want to push his luck knowing they cannot outbid e/where|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|haans: working on it|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/FlanneryAntiVariation.html|pg||
nt|jallerton: but here 4@h has 4 losers on a @d lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, this is a strange decision - does Townsend think he is behind?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: small @H now, but declarer will probably guess to put up the King|pg||

nt|mikael_w: det gäller att man är överens om sitt system när det blir sådana här budgivningar, hoppas verkligen att Ö/V hittar till 4 @h nu|pg||

nt|vasmar: he has 4 good cards in majors|pg||
nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||

nt|paulg:  it seems random to me with no outside entry, even if his minor values are soft|pg||
nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said at the start, this result will count in the second round robin as well as teams only play the qualifiers from the other group|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why can't they start at the same time each day?|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 am 12.30 pm your time|pg||

nt|hawe45:  One more gift now, letÂ´s see|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: South plays the 4th club after coming in whith the 1st round of trumps, of course|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|vasmar: since there is a ruffing finesse position in diamonds 6 are cold|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jfaria: in open Brink choose a light 4@s in first position in board 18. not a double game swing but NS were forced to 6@c -1|pg||

nt|h_karluk: np|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the penultimate board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If North had had K-Q in @H, West should take the first @h-trick and play another @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bye Vladimir|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: bye Hans, thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: another 3N for NS|pg||
nt|pauleger: 4@c by north would maybe be effective :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: boring 1N deal it looks like|pg||
nt|vasmar: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|jfaria: again Majors ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes because of the spades|pg||
nt|mamos: meanwhile NS judged well on Board 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@H here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: might be a delicate contract though|pg||
nt|copeyj: i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: ew will bid game i think|pg||
nt|eweber: right, I am wondering whether their strong club system made things difficult or possible here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: a lot of distribution around but no game seems to be available|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2!GH 3 card support 11-13|pg||
nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S 9 - and it is over|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodvenn: 3 nt is a natural contract which will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult hands to bid n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: altho townsend may double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: too much of his hand in @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult lead for North|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock by mistake sorry|pg||
nt|haans: believe 3@C was GF|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag antar att 1 @h visar @s, så nu behöver inte Cullin oroa sig för den färgen längre|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nu gäller det att dom vet vad som händer så att inte Uppmark tar detta som starkt och bra stöd i @c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men dom har säkert bra ordning på sådant, men man blir ju alltid lite orolig|pg||
nt|affe82: 5@d är väl vad som kan försökas. men det blir väl tungt med trumf fran försvaret ngn gang.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, jag tror man skall vara glad om man går hem i delkontrakt i @d här|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: no worries, its fine|pg||
nt|mamos: i think South needs to lead Hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: after cashing will do|pg||
nt|mamos: if not North will be endplayed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ajajaj|pg||
nt|affe82: vi kan enas om att det fanns 3 andra trumffärger som var bättre iaf.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: perhaps N expected to find S with xx xxx xx xxxxxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Mari-Volcker(France) and Stockdale/Brown (Eng ladies) made 6@d I hear|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var just detta jag syftade på, men det ÄR jobbigt när fi bjuder hela tiden|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its very close though, for example @CA onside would suffice|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@hs and a @s trick as a minimum|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: 4-0 break of course not helpful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och det skall det vara|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: Perhaps 4@s is Flint here, trying to sign off somewhere|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jfaria: now Fuck can ruff some @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@d|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|affe82: men @d ut erbjuder möjligheten att lata syd stjäla ett gäng höga ruter.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fucik worked for that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  hard to know what range East has actually shown |pg||

pc|c3|nt|affe82: gar nog nagon bet här.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: nice knowing who has the king|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vasmar: Purka yo mean|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: I suspect West was just signing off in 5@d, Paul|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pauleGER: not "well done" ? ME: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|pg||
nt|mamos: still ok if plays Heart when in with Club|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag misstänker att Cullin var orolig för att bli bortpsykad här. och Uppmark földe regeln att med missanpassning så gäller dett stanna så lågt som möjligt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: you are a regular commentator and we are sure that a nice personality there :)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lestergold: oh dear Towsened has abandoned 2 clubs and the enry form a spade finesse|pg||

nt|jfaria: last hand, thanks to my fellow commentators, and all the super kibs we got :) operator was great too |pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende.  Great concentration!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H is a nice contract, can even find @HK after overcall|pg||
mb|d!|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been 2NT opening?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: East had a  horrid position   - played South for Kx  which in a way was consistent with her defence  dont know what 1@H from North meant|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably expected south to have more than 10points for 2N|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 22/18|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentators: Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||
nt|eweber: though she might have expected North to have something for her 1@h bid|pg||
nt|mamos: these handa re glaringly obvious for us .......... but declarer has a different view :)|pg||
nt|eweber: they are playing very quickly, maybe too quick this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  n-s have a @s partcore here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s could be a cheap defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: strange |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but found the top spot anyway|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-lead seems to be best for N/S|pg||

pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: this only possible very fast players there, also in a long marathon operators got tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a savage misfit in the side suits and a nasty spade layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Me (and some spec.s - thanks) think defence took 2@H and 4@D|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Now 2 x @S - and the roof will come down - East can only get tricks from dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But after the double, East will guess, that @S are not behaving very well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||
