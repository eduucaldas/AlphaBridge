mb|1D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: not a good start for USA I|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Indeed not.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|gracelin: EW will bid to 4S and make it.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: There were ways to determine the likelihood of a diamond suit in the east hand.  First off, declarer ignored dummy's decent six-card suit to take a finesse in a side-suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: so there probably won't have any comparison, too.|pg||
nt|kareno: Hopefully the Operator will be able to get some comparisons for us.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Is NS in a forcing situation?  I thk not.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|kareno: Not for me.  If there was no forcing bid made en route to my vulnerable game, there's no force.|pg||
nt|gracelin: should be an easy make with all suits breaking well.|pg||
nt|kareno: Many pairs treat this as a forcing situation because of the vulnerability.  I feel that is an error.|pg||
nt|liujing:  S didn't overcall 1@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|liujing:  so 4@H suggests length but not strength|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Not a hand worth a vulnerable preempt I think - too many losers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: Agree with Karen.  It's the strength rather than Vulnerability decide the forcing or not.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: So I agree with Kerri Sanborn on all of her actions on this hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: we are from the same school, Karen.  But there are those who were taught " Vul. is for kids".|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and one of them is on this USA team :)  |pg||
nt|kareno: I refer, of course, to the very exciting player, Karen McCallum.|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, but north's bidding probably showed her 0-6-4-3 distribution at this time.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: On 22, USA pushed to 4@h and with a heart lead this should be a swing to USA|pg||

nt|gracelin: East has no reason not to lead SQ, but the longer she thinks, the more worry I am,|pg||

nt|kareno: They won't need a director after the hand is over.  Perhaps south's pass over 3@s was slow.|pg||
nt|liujing:  probably BIT occured when DBL|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe because the hesitation over 3S and the second double.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: And as a spec points out, with a singleton club, west could overtake the spade and lead the singleton.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: and if north has seven spade and a singleton club, she will overtake and lead club.  West heard East bid 3S.|pg||

nt|kareno: They have played magnificently.|pg||
nt|liujing:  in my concept of carding, ATTITUDE is always first!|pg||
nt|kareno: I play that at the five-level or higher, lead of king asks count.  This is a sort of similar situation.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: in fact this was just a slip.  AFter East's 3S bid, if West has 7S, she knew the 2nd spade is not cashing, and will overtake to lead her singleton club.|pg||

nt|kareno: Surely east has shown three spades and four or more hearts.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer playing hearts conveniently to keep an entry in dummy for the diamond eventually.  Now she has two dummy entries in hearts.  One for club finesse, one for diamond.  ...|pg||
nt|kareno: However, she is now open to a spade shift.|pg||
nt|gracelin: low spade is best, but will not beat it.|pg||
nt|kareno: With a spade back I think she cannot risk the club finesse.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, she will take her 10 tricks|pg||
