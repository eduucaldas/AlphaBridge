nt|Walddk2: uch better odds|pg||

nt|snorris: must try to duck some @ss and a @c and ply for a squezze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well a huge swing out of nowhere.  3NT must have been the right contract, as Geoffrey said even he could make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The pause now indicates that he thought he had 10 tricks by drawing trumps, don't you think?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe north thought he played 3nt?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: From what I've seen so far, this is indeed a "slip of the brain"|pg||
