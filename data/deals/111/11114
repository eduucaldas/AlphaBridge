nt|marlowepi: welcome|pg||
nt|chick: short of entries to her hand, must give up 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club seems right here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: sry . down conecction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must give up one, then finesse prepared to lose the other, which does not happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bbo scores aren't official - at tables player enter using bridgemate for official results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting - the technical - in isolation -  play in @Cs does not work|pg||
nt|mcarroll: However given the entry situation playing @C A wins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am wondering what she is thinking about. club from hand seems to stand out. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was thinking S will go down if she plays ace of clubs|pg||
nt|chick: that's why must give 2 club tricks, need to save entry to spades|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and - on mature reflection - you are right Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but she doesnt have to give up 2 club tricks, only one|pg||

nt|chick: opening 1@D is pretty standard around here, because otherwise no good rebid|pg||

nt|chick: I (for example) would never open the N hand 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, whereas we are delighted for partner to give preference back to Ds|pg||
nt|chick: partner bids a major and what do you do?   reverse?  bid 1N without anything in either major?  rebid @Cs and ignore the @D suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: down internet here and the girls did not want to schedule the bridgemate while I called for help. These women are not all pleasant. The more i know the U.S.girl more like the ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: Brazilians. of my people. I'm sorry more this stupid than women. bye|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the worst problem is getting preference back to diamonds. it is rare that opening 1C causes a problem. you can raise the major on 3 with many hands, or bid 1N, or rebid clubs. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's partnership style issue    raise on 3, NT with singleton, rebid @C with only 5, start 1@D and have unclear shape with 1@D/2@C|pg||
