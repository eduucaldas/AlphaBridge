mb|p|nt|flash: if the opps take away your room at the 5-level, double with an even   of key cards, pass with an odd  |pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@sx is an 1100 save. but then risky to try 6NT in case South has a different ace missing |pg||

nt|jbgood: at least we have a final here in the transnationals that was predicted by most experts|pg||
nt|jallerton: Geir Helgemo not following Kit Woolsey's advice.  Kit's advice is to virtually never save|pg||
