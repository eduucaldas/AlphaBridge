nt|kwalker: If this West hand is all that's needed to accept a gametry, they must never turn one down. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: Good carding structure that our coach gave us when I was on a team with both Mancuso and Sutherlin a couple of years ago.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: in that case why not play small?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|afulton: Changed her mind? |pg||
nt|gosia: can't possibly get this igh here|pg||
nt|gosia: high|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Pam is saying that she didnt imagine that values in Karen hand|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Never say never|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  we all have blind spots|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: if club ace was a true card, then that way of playibg clubs has no winning position. works only against doubleton lead by W which is near impossible|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N may well make on this hand becaue of lack of entries to @d suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: So Shawn will have gone the whole set without playing a board, it is not often you can say your declarer play was perfect over 16 boards|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|afulton: But didn't the double ask for @H?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jwit:  1 D overcall proved very effective for the defense|pg||

nt|afulton: Special thanks go to Roland Wald (and his sub today, Flash) for coordinating this  and of course, to Fred who allowed BBO to be the venue in which these games could be shown. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear to ask for heart lead when you can certainly stand a D lead, but if that is partner's suit she is not that likely to have an entry. still, the fact that you have THREE ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamonds insteead of two calls the double into question. with a doubleton king much better chance it is right to double. all atht said, you may have two entries so still probably ...|pg||
