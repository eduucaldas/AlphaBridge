nt|mugsmate: Aggressive lead from the hK here may beat this. A diamond lead or even trumps would be chosen by many with the clubs sown up|pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: EW might be able to make a mild nuisance of themselves in diamonds here, over a strong 1@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: if east raises to 3@D, south doubles, and will north now cue 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: now that south hasn't doubled 2NT, his side might well not bid game|pg||

nt|marlowepi: since N is a passed hand at favorable colors, 3C would not seem out of line|pg||

nt|mugsmate: Maybe not, but you put the responder to the double in the balancing seat & he'll really strain to bid if he's only loooking at 3 hearts.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that part is true, though if he didnt bid already at these colors as a passed hand that is probably not as dangerous as othewrwise, generall speaking. here though you are surely ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right that N would probably bid. on the other hand, most people with his hand would already have bid i think|pg||
