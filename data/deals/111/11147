nt|athene: this issue has come up a few times over the past weeks|pg||
nt|athene: all serious partnerships should discuss when a pass after a t/o double and a redouble IS a penalty pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's standard to play it neutral at the 1-level and penalties at the 3-level, i think - but there's a big nebulous area in the middle :)|pg||
