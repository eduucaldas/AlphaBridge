mb|1S|nt|bbramley: another big club fit, but 3NT is the last making game|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|jallerton: may be trying to duplicate the action in the other room at this stage, David|pg||

nt|dburn: here, though, his opponents are in deep trouble|pg||

nt|dburn: you got us into this - you get us out of it|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: it's not matchpoints - he's looking for the surest line for 9 tricks - ducking a @C takes care of 3-1 splits - can he handle 4-0?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kareno: Okay, how, barnet?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: that was supposed to be West getting them out of it, not South, but Sacul does not mind who comes to his rescue as long as it's someone|pg||

nt|the saint: Not an easy defence for Price though. Will find himself on lead when he doesn't want to be|pg||

mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: yikes, what is this|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they reach 6 would west double and what will he lead ?|pg||

nt|the saint: East might be left with the last two trumps for the last two tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be -1 but i dont think that would happen|pg||
nt|the saint: Club A, club ruff, spade ruff, club ruff (dropping K), spade ruff, cash club J, heart ruff, spade ruff, and trump ace for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing on clubs i think is best|pg||
nt|fabsayc: certainly many ways to still make, but relying on club king dropping is scarey|pg||
nt|the saint: Also works becasue short club has singleton trump|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: that cant be the right discard|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|the saint: Other lines will require the club finesse|pg||

nt|jallerton: Chris Dixon suggests that 4@s might make.  But the force in clubs is not that pleasant|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but he doesn't really want to play in spades unless East has five of them|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bbramley: meck is marginal for 3NT - that's why he passed 3@D earlier - but now he's offering 3NT, just in case|pg||

mb|6N|nt|dburn: so Sacul may indeed be heading for 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: a @h lead (necessary to beat 6NT) is ineffective against 6@d as a heart can be ruffed in West to establish the suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: South is on lead, presumably he'll be told by West that 4NT is natural|pg||
