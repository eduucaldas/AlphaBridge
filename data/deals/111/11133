mb|p|nt|flash: fairly straightforward 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: yes to Polish Club|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told yes.  So north's is the rarer strong 1@c |pg||
nt|flash: convention card at  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/seniorsbowl/poland/kowalski-romanski.pdf|pg||
nt|kareno: And e/w could be in trouble right here, right now.  Though they do have an escape suit.|pg||
nt|flash: 1@C is 12-14 balanced, 15+ natural or 18+ any...|pg||
nt|kareno: However, this is the end of n/s playing in a heart contract :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kareno: This could be like that Rueful Rabbit story of both sides playing the same suit.|pg||
nt|kareno: East will redouble for rescue I assume, if north passes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|flash: running scores in the 3 remaining matches from  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|flash: from the 5-0 to the 5-1...   XX from Passell to find the 4-4??|pg||
nt|kareno: I assume south will pass and that will happen.|pg||
nt|kareno: If, indeed, the double is for penalties.  North has shown primary hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: i've had some feedback that counting the North hand as 18+ (with the singleton @C) is a distortion|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Well, we now know what west would do - he's done it.  This isn't much better than 1@h doubled, though the trumps are more evenly divided.|pg||
nt|flash: can get out for down 1, avoiding disaster, but...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|kareno: 3nt possible n/s but there are only eight tricks easily available.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno: Would need help for the ninth.|pg||
nt|barnets: exciting start|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back) to Barnet Shenkin|pg||
nt|kareno: John Sutherlin a fine declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: Barnet, we meet again and hopefully for more than a board :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I think any plus for n/s is a winner here.|pg||
nt|barnets: thats sometimes all some partnerships last !|pg||
nt|kareno: As expected 4@h the contract in the CR. and it won't fetch.|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to tap out east's last spade winner.  Then |pg||

nt|kareno: Should take out that last trump.|pg||
nt|kareno: South did pass the double after all.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|flash: so this will be a very expensive start for USA 2 and another lead change|pg||
nt|flash: we've gone from a possible down 1 to a likely down 2 to a (n excessive?) down 3|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: hoi william|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|lc: Welcome to the final 16 deals of this match.|pg||
nt|lc: This is the semifinals of the World SEnior Championships.|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: hi William|pg||
nt|josj: hi Liliek|pg||
nt|josj: hi William|pg||
nt|athene: Hallberg isn't tempted to open 1@D, to make it easy to show both suits|pg||
nt|westjava: Bang Jos!!!|pg||
nt|josj: Pak Liliek :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: glad you are here was too heavy almost 80% of the afternoon session i was on my own here|pg||
nt|lc: Winner of this match plays winner of England/Indonesia for the title.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: hoi JJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he probably just considers the hand strong enough to reverse|pg||
nt|lc: North, barely has enough to reverse into 2@S.|pg||
nt|lc: Now, N-S will need to know how South shows a WEAK hand.|pg||
nt|lc: Lair-Berk a "semi-regular" partnership -- don't play too much together.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: but the problem is, if you have to rebid 5@D, partner can't go back to clubs at the same level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Although they will have discussed reverses, maybe not this one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|athene: sometimes you can get round this by bidding an unusual NT but here, 4NT from east would sound like RKCB for hearts|pg||
nt|josj: but what's wrong with 6@C?|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer needed a lot of luck in this game.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: 6 @C made whilst you have @D T98:)|pg||
nt|athene: oh i am not saying there is anything wrong with 6@C :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: but this argument is why you might be inclined to open 1@D with 5@D6@C, sometimes|pg||
nt|lc: Sort of needs to play @H and @S for no losers.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: Surely there will be the old case of "good news-bad news" when the @H finesse winds.|pg||
nt|lc: wins.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lc: This presents interesting options for declarer, who doesn't realize that he is doomed.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both down >100|pg||
nt|lc: There is all sorts of pyschology at play here -- Declarer wondering why they gave him a ruff-sluff when they could have exited in @C.|pg||
nt|lc: I understand conceding down 100-- as opposed to some of the down 5- concessions we saw a few days ago.|pg||
nt|lc: Here, there is even more reason to rest, as there is a playoff for the Bronze medal between the seminfinal losers.|pg||
nt|lc: Although, having been there too many times, I can tell you that it is depressing to play in that match -- even if you win.|pg||
nt|lc: I wish they would just declarer a tie for 3/4 and cut the bronze medal down the medal and give each team half of it.|pg||
nt|lc: It is so sad to lose in the semis.|pg||
nt|lc: I remember losing by 3 in to Holland in semis in 1993 in Chile --  the last thing I wanted to do was play bridge the next day.|pg||
nt|lc: Is anyone here to chat with me?|pg||
nt|lc: I feel like I am talking to myself :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Larry, folks.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, we all see declarer is going down -- so good time for tangential topics.|pg||
nt|lc: One such topic....|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lc: I've heard people say "watching Vugraph is boring."|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, there was a letter in ACBL Bulletin to that effect.|pg||
nt|lc: Wow.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lc: I think it is great -- especially if you can switch from table to table.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|nt|lc: Or, if the commentators give instruction, info, etc.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|lc: If it is boring, then maybe bridge isn't for you.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hQ|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: no squeeze, because north can guard the spades|pg||
nt|lc: Although, I know many who say watching golf on TV is boring.  Others LIVE for it.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s8|nt|westjava: goos start from England|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: Sure, nobody wants to watch 1NT take 20 minutes -- but there are other things to do while that is happening.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|hT|pc|cT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exciting for those who love watching grass grow.|pg||
nt|lc: Okay, we are nearing the end -- I am told East in 1@S X at other table.|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|kareno: Seven of clubs to ruff, a suit preference for spades :)|pg||
nt|flash: down 6??   |pg||
nt|flash: even with a donation or two, this is a big swing...|pg||
nt|kareno: It's going to be bloody.  East could know that west has primary spades but is that enough information for him to remove to that suit?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: No donations so far.  Hmm.. calls for diamond.|pg||
nt|flash: even non-vulnerable, sometimes it makes sense to let the opps steal (if that's, indeed, what they're doing)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flash: pitch or it gets worse...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|barnets: if north was looking for game as he bid shows east was marked with little in values|pg||
nt|kareno: So Passell will have to break spades himself, Queen of hearts now and another diamond.|pg||
nt|flash: we're up to 7 on the @HQ here...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|flash: or just @HQ and another @H??|pg||
nt|kareno: North has the full count of west's hand.  It's a double dummy problem|pg||
nt|flash: a most stingy donation...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: North has misdefended.  He had to get west's trumps out before playing on diamonds.|pg||
nt|barnets: spade rufffed and 2 more hearts dec makes just 2 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that will do it.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h7|nt|kareno: South is on lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lc: Commentating can be dangerous if you hit ENTER when it was PRIVATE and it goes public  !  :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: north has higher ambitions than a simple 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he may now bid 3@D to show the shortage|pg||
nt|athene: and south will say "no, my hand doesn't love diamond shortage opposite"|pg||
nt|athene: depends on their methods of course|pg||
nt|westjava: might cant stop in 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: south has the worst conceivable hand, facing a club hand with short diamonds|pg||
nt|lc: Nice East hand here, the reason I don't play  money bridge.|pg||
nt|lc: West will be amused that his opps are in 2/1 GF auction.|pg||
nt|lc: No doubt, he is warming up his RED CARD.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: no aces, no clubs, a billion wasted diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: even the 5-level is too high|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C-2|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S and 1@D losers|pg||
nt|athene: plus the spade ruff|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh yes,@S ruff|pg||
nt|athene: is 4@D a splinter, or RKCB for clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: either way, NS are going negative now, i am sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Less so if they drop his @dk.|pg||
nt|lc: So, N-S likely to reach 5@D--|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: 51D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: I doubt WEst will double 5@D.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: a heart lead of course allows 5@C to make|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead beats by two|pg||
nt|athene: do you favour your long suit, or your sequence (@HJ10)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Hmmm.|pg||
nt|lc: I find that one of the biggest downfalls of experts is too many 3NT's when 5-minor is right.|pg||
nt|lc: Obviously, at matchpoints, it is different.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|athene: not much to go on; maybe with the @H9, West wld have gone for that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: Marty Bergen's theory is that experts are way too reluctant to reach 5-minor.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|athene: normal procedure for east is to play @SA then @SK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|athene: inverting the normal order|pg||
nt|lc: Interesting decision in @H here.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to show a doubleton|pg||
nt|lc: How was Lair to know to play the 9!|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but it all got done anyway|pg||
nt|lc: Incidentally, it is Standard Polish to lead SECOND best.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|westjava: well defence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: The only good thing for Lair is that he is not doubled.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lc: I can't say that surely 5@D would have made, but I can say that it was a much better contract than 3NT.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|lc: I suppose Berk thought his @CQ might be useful for notrump.|pg||

nt|barnets: and all of a sudden Poland take a decent size lead of 25|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|flash: it's always discouraging to see an (overly?) aggressive action get punished, when simply sitting in one's seat would have avoided the loss|pg||
nt|kareno: Still quite a few boards to be played but the momentum is definitely with Poland.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|flash: down only 5 - 2 IMPs off the cost...   USA fans will take both of them gladly|pg||
nt|barnets: the play actually shown is down 6 so can you check it |pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|barnets: so there must have been a different play somewhere|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: the defense could force dummy twice|pg||

nt|barnets: promoting a spade trick|pg||
nt|barnets: yes dec can draw trumps and give a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: it was quickly pointed out|pg||

pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting lead|pg||
nt|athene: not unreasonable|pg||
nt|westjava: little bit diff bid but the same contract|pg||
nt|athene: these days, there's a marked tendency for experts to try to avoid the "expected" lead|pg||
nt|athene: so if they have a 2-suiter, for instance, and they show one suit and opps bid 3nt, they will always lead the other suit|pg||
nt|westjava: still 4 tricks only|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lc: A Mixed raise is "more than a preempt, less than limit"|pg||
nt|lc: 3@C -- jump-cue would show it.|pg||
nt|lc: Many (I'd say most) experts use the jump cue-bid this way (MIxed).|pg||
nt|bigtrain: those that don't choose to use one-under as mixed|pg||
nt|lc: I find, though, that it is not a good convention for newer players as it is often forgotten.|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|lc: One week, Berk called me to tell me his partner (who was a friend), forgot Mixed raises once-to-twice a day on average.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: The number on Bd 18 was 1400!    click movie to see it.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but here, he perhaps decided that building a slow third heart trick wasn't the issue|pg||
nt|lc: A big victory on 18 for the Polish 2-bid - as you can see it trapped Passell into the number.|pg||
nt|lc: Not a pleasant way for Sutherlin-Passell to start,  -300, -1400.  Very deflating.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: only a fast third heart could be useful since a spade/diamond switch is coming|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|athene: when you have a suit like AQxxx / xx, there's no special advantage in finessing the queen first time|pg||

nt|santyclz: Poland gain only 15 imps on 18.  It could have been worse.|pg||
nt|lc: So, a decent 4@S is missed, but with the bad @C split, E-W did well to stop.|pg||
nt|lc: E-W will be pleased when they see the 4-1 @C break.    Not likely to bid game on E-W cards, but surely possible.|pg||
nt|lc: Especially, with Passell-Sutherlin early disasters, they could be apt to push to 4@S here E-W.|pg||

nt|westjava: an important 2 imps for this close match|pg||
nt|lc: 2@C for North?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lc: If he opens 1@D, could be easier to describe later -- but there might not be a later.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lc: 2@C strong, with hands such as North can be awkward --|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: As the next bid is 3@D -- and then no room.|pg||
nt|lc: 2@H -  dbl neg|pg||
nt|lc: This method has gained popularity over the last 10 years.|pg||
nt|santyclz: This time w was likely to reopen, but there are no guarantees.|pg||
nt|lc: Has lots of merit. Some plusses, some minuses|pg||
nt|bigtrain: one of the worst conventions invented|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lc: USA did get some back, not a surprise, on 19 where N-S had a good result when E-W stopped bidding prematurely in our room.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: the nebulous 1@D opener buries a lot of fits|pg||
nt|athene: a common theme these days|pg||
nt|lc: I used to not like it, but Bergen convinced me that it has merit.|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, Bergen thinks it is great and teaches it.|pg||
nt|lc: I see both sides of the argument.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: although it's more usually a short (2+) 1@C opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: NS just bid EW's two 8-card fits and ignored their own 9-card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: difficult for decl to get more than 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ or @SJ nets a lot of tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't do that, declarer should cash his six tops |pg||
nt|lc: 3@D was forcing, so South had to do something.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: it's fine as long as @H aren't in the picture...  just don't see the downside of using cheaper minor |pg||
nt|lc: It's not like Berk enjoyed bidding 31S.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, this is surely a better spot than 3NT :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think he may enjoy playing it leass than bidding it|pg||
nt|bigtrain: less|pg||
nt|lc: As to 5@D or 4@S or 4@H, nothing is good.|pg||
nt|lc: This looks ugly and not fun.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The advantage of 3nt on these hands is that it's over much more quickly.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: an interesting point of strategy here, worth mentioning|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: Hallberg knows his partner has a good hand|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: answer:- he has diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|athene: you can often make this assumption after a 1@C or 1@D opener|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes it's good to play in 1nt when everyone has a fit they didn't find, but not here|pg||
nt|lc: In Standard, 2@C--response--3@D is indeed a messy and unpleasant start.|pg||
nt|lc: He, the big @C player, smirks. :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Other table plays Polish @C, so won't have this problem.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|lc: I suppose, though, he is in no danger of making it.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe fantunes has the right philosophy|pg||
nt|lc: Which is?|pg||

nt|lc: No surprise that E-W did push to 4@S on previous deal, unlucky a bit to be down 1.|pg||
nt|lc: So, 6 to Poland instead of 10 to USA2 on the 4-1 @C split.|pg||
nt|lc: Although, 4-1 @S would also have beaten it.|pg||
nt|santyclz: He can get out for -1 which is a triumph (of sorts).|pg||

mb|d|nt|lc: Well, let's wait and see if he is in 4@H.|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe 3NT ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: three black winners and a club make 4@H too much to handle doesn't it?|pg||
nt|lc: Not sure.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: In open room, Passell cashed 3 black winners and played a spade|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer can ruff @C high and unblock @DA on @SQ and run @HJ.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll check DF|pg||
nt|lc: After Passell's start, declarer can certainly make if he guesses @H.|pg||
nt|lc: Very possible to guess @H given WEst's bidding here -- (the bidding I foolishly endorsed) :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bigtrain: according to deep fineese ...  three rounds of clubs beats it (don't even need to cash the @SA|pg||
nt|lc: OK -- so on way to 4@H, and we will get to see if it can be made.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok - not that interested :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if south had had that same hand with a doubleton diamond, 6@S would be pretty good|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: as the cards lie, you can make we tricks even without a diamond lead, by squeezing east in the red suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: *make twelve tricks|pg||
nt|lc: WEst might have guessed to save in 4@S, which looks to be down only 1.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: 4@S easier to anlayze than 4@H.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: So, GIB indeed says it can make.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lc: I believe, as I said earlier, it involves unblocking the @DA on the @SQ and guessing @H.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Cashing the @sa is fatal.|pg||
nt|lc: Best test will be @CAK and a low @C.|pg||
nt|lc: I am confident Berk will guess the @H.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lc: How's that for pressure on my 20-year partner!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: yes...c ashing the @SA allows @D to be unblocked|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: east had a nasty hand to lead from - he knew his partner held nothing and any lead was likely to be very risky|pg||
nt|athene: trump is possible as the safest bet but a singleton trump is never very nice|pg||
nt|gerstman2: South guessed hearts to make in open room.  It was pointed out that Mike did well not to lead the club, or it would have given the show away|pg||
nt|lc: I wonder if this @D switch will convince Berk that West has only 1@D ...|pg||
nt|lc: And therefore maybe 2@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Remember that West Doubled 2@H for takeout after N-S bid both red suits.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: here, David can misguess hearts, but still make by pitching all the clubs on the diamonds|pg||
nt|lc: No doubt, Berk will place West with at least 10 black cards.|pg||
nt|lc: I guess without Russyan cashing the other @C, declarer can't go wrong any more.|pg||
nt|lc: But, bad news for USA2 is that 620 already was made by Romanski in the Open.|pg||
nt|lc: Romasnki-Kowalski are having a crusher of a set for Poland in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Switch the 7 and 8 of @hs and it can't be made on ak a @c.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|athene: partner with Qxx, AJx, A10xx doesn't thank you|pg||

nt|lc: So, this one is very light for him.|pg||
nt|kit: this will be a good time not to lead partner's suit vs. 3NT|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: ah ok :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lc: Lair will drive to game, for sure.|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S was a psyche?|pg||
nt|athene: north doubled 1@D?|pg||
nt|athene: that would make it all (sort of) more explicable|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, objectively, this is better, as 4@S *can* be beaten|pg||
nt|athene: but vul at imps, you want to be IN games that need pinpoint defence to beat!|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed that south passed the first time|pg||
nt|athene: no-one passes that hand!|pg||
nt|athene: especially not playing strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but even playing standard...very few experts would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: What would you lead, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: the missed game happens at least 5 times more often than the number IMO|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: I lead the 5-card suit I know about, not the one which might not exist|pg||
nt|lc: More troubles for Passell-Sutherlin as they overreach on previous deal and Polish lead grows.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|lc: Kit and I are used to PRecision, where 1@D doesn't mean @D, anyway.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: Here, where declarer bids 1NT over 1@D, he rates to have @D.|pg||
nt|kit: East is fortunate he will only have to make 1 discard, otherwise he would be squeezed out of his heart|pg||
nt|lc: It seems dec has 9 tricks without the @C.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator puts it at 14.60 points.|pg||
nt|lc: Am I missing something Kit?|pg||
nt|lc: Not 9 tricks with the @S coming in?|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, miscounted|pg||
nt|kit: he has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|santyclz: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lc: Thoughtful play to return a @H.|pg||
nt|lc: You can always play for the @S to come in later.|pg||
nt|kit: nice play by declarer, in case something isn't splitting this might correct count for squeeze|pg||
nt|lc: Also, if East has @SKx or @SK singleton...|pg||
nt|lc: need to know HOW to play the @S.|pg||
nt|lc: This will help declarer with the count.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: of course if this were the position East could foil it by not continuing hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: For example, if East has @SKx, running the @SJ will not produce 4 @S tricks.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: since declarer needs 1 entry for the spade finesse, and another entry to cash the fourth spade if they split|pg||
nt|lc: So, now the @SJ, I suppose.|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer will presumably play East for @SKxx -- not shorter @S.|pg||
nt|lc: I don't see any reason for him to place East with @S shortness.|pg||
nt|kit: unless he thinks East has only 2 spades, in which case he might lead a low spade to queen, ace of spades, and go down|pg||
nt|lc: Also, he can test @S and always fall back on @C in case @H are 4-4.|pg||
nt|lc: It doesn't look like @H 4-4 -- but it is possible.|pg||
nt|lc: Since he can still make with @SKx East by falling back on 4-4@H, I presume he will lead @SJ.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: In open room, south played @d to K and J@S|pg||
nt|lc: So, likely a push (at best for USAw) and time running out for them.|pg||
nt|lc: 7 deals after this to make up 29 IMPs.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|kit: declarer's heart play was very thoughtful, but the defense wasn't having any of it -- if declarer wants hearts led, don't lead hearts|pg||
nt|lc: 6 after this. 7 including this.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer is still not 100% home.|pg||
nt|lc: After the @SQ wins the next trick he has to decide if @S3-3 or @H5-3.|pg||
nt|lc: For example, if he were to cash 3 rounds of @SH and East started with 4=4=3=2, for example, he would go down when by playing @C first he could make.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm pretty sure he will play for the spades to be 3-3|pg||
nt|lc: I'd bet on that as well -- but is is far from 100%.|pg||
nt|lc: And, if anyone wants to know about E-W count signals in @S, don't ask.|pg||
nt|lc: They aren't going to give honest count here.|pg||
nt|kit: after all, West did have a reason for leading a heart rather than his partner's suit|pg||
nt|lc: Signalling partner on defense is nice, but not when it will only help declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: that to me is the big clue|pg||
nt|lc: Agreed.|pg||
nt|lc: Not likely to lead from @HK109x instead of a @D from four when partner opens 1@D.|pg||
nt|kit: Also, if East had Axxx of hearts, he would have gone up ace of hearts -- why couldn't declarer have Qx?|pg||
nt|lc: I think if East had @HAxxx his play would be irrelevant, no?|pg||
nt|kit: oh, sorry -- dummy had 3 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
nt|lc: So, as we wait for Berk to end his suffering, any good topics we should be discussing?|pg||
nt|lc: How are you doing int he Transnational teams, Kit?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|kit: well, against me it would be easy -- my motto on lead vs. 3NT is to look in my hand.  If I have a 5-card suit, I lead it.  If not, I look for partner's 5-card suit.|pg||

nt|lc: Berk can raise @D now, maybe 3.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: Way to go Berk.|pg||
nt|kit: seems more accurate for North to rebid his 6-card heart suit -- more descriptive, and stops South from bidding 2 of a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: 3@D just should be competitive -- based on trump length.|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, meant East|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: declarer will just knock out the @HA and take nine, i imagine - not sure if he can come to a tenth safely|pg||
nt|athene: he might be able to lead to the @CK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: This contract has an obvious flaw.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: Passell & Sutherlin stopped in 3, so could be small pickup for USA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: even if that lost to the @CA, the defence could only get three clubs and the @HA at most|pg||
nt|lc: looks like 5 to USA2 then.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: he just checks first the diamonds are running|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: east does best to hold up in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then south has to set up his heart tricks but now it's not safe to try the club for the overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: but west might have visions of @HJx with his partner|pg||
nt|lc: SHould be 0 problem for defense here.|pg||
nt|lc: Famous last words.|pg||
nt|kit: Lair's problem will be whether or not to underlead his ace of clubs, but this time it won't matter|pg||
nt|lc: Right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: start with @C3 in case Berk begain with doubleton king|pg||
nt|lc: Not likely underlead will work as declarer sure to guess right, but not much for Lair to hope for.|pg||
nt|kit: He has to decide whether to play his partner for Jxx of hearts, or for queen of clubs and declarer misguessing|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, declarer won't misguess @C|pg||
nt|lc: Netiher seems likely.|pg||
nt|kit: why couldn't East have only a 5-card heart suit?|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose -- so @Hjxx is best chance.  @C misguess no chance.|pg||
nt|kit: on the other hand East didn't support spades, so East very unlikely to have a stiff club, making underlead safe|pg||
nt|kit: particularly if East has only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so I think he should underlead|pg||
nt|gerstman2: after cashing 2 clubs, NS have to carefully cash A@S|pg||
nt|kit: if North leads ace of clubs, you can bet the ace of spades will hit the table before the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|lc: As I look over the scorecard, the players at this table both suspect the match is virtually tied.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|lc: It looks like each pair has about an even scorecard and the segment started virtually tied.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Actually, if declarer has Kxx of clubs, underlead is his only chance -- declarer won't know he doesn't have AQx of clubs|pg||
nt|lc: Little do they know that Kowalski-Romanski are having a killer game.|pg||

nt|kit: Well, if 3@H is a slam try, then there is real reason to lead ace of spades -- what other hope can there be?|pg||
mb|p|an|positive|nt|athene: 1@H a definite possibility for west there, i think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: Sounds good in theory, but in practice that @CQ just jumps out of your hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a good suit|pg||
nt|kit: it is a longshot, but looking at the West hand it is impossible for South to have a slam try and 4@H go down on power|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lc: I had @DQJ1098 on lead against a slam in Spingold semi last month and led something else.|pg||

nt|lc: Don't ask.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Any chance of a low @s lead?|pg||

nt|lc: That @CQ just jumped out.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: The mundane Q@c|pg||
nt|lc: So, claim 5 and 13 IMPs.|pg||

nt|athene: given that he passed @SAKQxx and a side queen a moment ago|pg||
nt|athene: he now decides it's good enough to open and accept an invitation|pg||
nt|lc: And, that sure looks to be POLAND.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: EW might be able to make a mild nuisance of themselves in diamonds here, over a strong 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if east raises to 3@D, south doubles, and will north now cue 4@D?|pg||
nt|lc: So, here is what looks to be the 3 FINAL MATCHES starting tomorrow:|pg||
nt|lc: SEniors -- 96 boards over 2 days, Poland versus England|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: Ladies/Venice  --  96 boards over 2 days,  USA1  versus China|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now that south hasn't doubled 2NT, his side might well not bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D from north now|pg||
nt|athene: would be nice if it were definitely 55 majors|pg||
nt|athene: with a trap of diamonds he would surely just double|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lc: Open/Bermuda Bowl  --  128 boards over 3 days, ITALY versus USA2.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the remaining Venice Cup match   China leads France by 37 with one to play  |pg||
nt|lc: I suspect BBO will set the record for most kibs ever at one table some tiime in the next 3 days.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: well, a bizarre auction here|pg||
nt|athene: everyone sort of believed 2NT|pg||

nt|lc: Italy-USA in final of BErmuda Bowl -- again.  Slightly different cast of characters every year, but often those 2 countries.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It takes a little something to beat that record, but I agree with Larry; I think we will|pg||
nt|lc: As we have hit garbage time here, there are so many people to thank.|pg||
nt|gerstman2: And 3 bronze medal matches tomorrow as well - USA 2 v. Indonesia for Seniors, USA2 v. France for Venice, and |pg||
nt|lc: One of them, you just heard from ...|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s7|nt|lc: Yes, the World Bridge Federation -- not easy to run such an event.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lc: Specs watching in record numbers -- nice to see.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: And to all the commentators who have donated their time and expertise. They are all volunteers; no-one is paid one cent|pg||

nt|lc: Well, the margin is 24 -- and the IMP table does go up to 24 ...|pg||
nt|lc: You never know :)|pg||
mc|6|nt|lc: USA2 needs a "top" on the IMP scale.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Slam swing possible on the last board, but it won't be enough|pg||
nt|lc: Let's see if BOard 32 has a 24-IMP swing in it.|pg||

nt|barnets: that will be 9|pg||
nt|kareno: And to you flash for keeping it light and rooting so hard for your country's team :)|pg||
nt|flash: so...   as much as i'd hope for a miracle to end things|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|flash: first and foremost:  sincerest congratulations to Carolyn Lynch for this great success in her maiden run in this level of competition|pg||
nt|reisig: @d guess ...for the match?|pg||
nt|flash: and congrats to the USA 2 team for a great performance|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe e/w can bid and guess slam|pg||
nt|kareno: 6nt can be made here.|pg||
nt|flash: most of all, congrats to the Polish squad, particularly the pair we've been watching, for a most solid perfomance and a well-earned victory|pg||
nt|barnets: yes and guessing diamonds seems against odds|pg||
nt|kareno: But may not be enough unless made here and down in the CR.  And that may not be enough!!|pg||
nt|barnets: Poland have played excellently especially the last two setsp this pair|pg||
nt|reisig: I'll bet 6N ..both rooms|pg||
nt|flash: same time, same station tomorrow for the start of the 3 final matches|pg||
nt|kareno: Poland have really played well this set and obviously earlier to get to this winning position.|pg||
nt|barnets: If West believes he is behind he may play against the odds in his slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|reisig: asking aces ..holding 2?|pg||
nt|kareno: Checking for aces.|pg||
nt|flash: 4@C Gerber (ace-asking)?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: belt and suspenders time - no chances...|pg||
nt|barnets: the normal play in diamonds is the ace and one to the 10 which picks KJxx and KJxxx|pg||
nt|flash: 22 + 9 means there's room to be off 2 aces, no matter how unlikely?|pg||
nt|barnets: in south|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|flash: might a quantitative 4NT have been more to the point?  needs a source of tricks/maximum from partner??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: a slam swing would be 17 imps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|flash: @S6 as the most passive lead available|pg||
nt|kareno: I think there was no chance he wouldn't bid slam if not off two aces.|pg||
nt|reisig: "I put you in a position to win the match - now  - do it!"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

nt|lc: Well, 6NT -1 by uSA2 won't exactly do it.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: It's with the odds to go down if you see what I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Looks like "how to play @D suit."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finessing @D10 is best but won't work here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: south must be tired i think|pg||
nt|athene: that is a clear X of 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lc: This sort of thing (@D suit) can be put into a computer program that gives you all the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and was indeed made in the other room|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@H = 4 spades and 7-9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: So, this will make the margin 12-13 IMPS greater for Poland who played very well and are deserving representatives of their country.|pg||
nt|lc: Congrats to Poland on reaching the final.  And to USA2 for a great showiing.|pg||
nt|lc: USA2 will face INDonesia tomorrow for the Bronze medal...|pg||
