mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And our first comparison. In the closed room they had to deal with a slam hand first up|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzwj: they reached 6@s under heavy interference|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwj: let's see if they can reach it here without it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: looks like 2@h follows by 4@s by E, mild slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: which E needs to accept|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: A club lead makes things very tough in 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With no opposition bidding, wouldn't youfinesse it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: @c lead from S ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But East will be declarer, Bill|pg||
mb|3D!|an|maximum, 4 cards support|nt|bjacobs: Maybe|pg||
mb|p|an|and useful doubleton in !d|nt|Walddk2: assuming they play re-transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The doubleton diamond opposite won't thrill West|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West should certainly organize to make East declarer, with xxx in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room declarer (WEst) had been warned after North's pre-empt, so he rose with @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: quite a lucky break for EW there|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: to find N with singel @c, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: W still tanking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and now the play on a club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: 4@c is appearently gerber|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You must be kidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: S asked W and W said "4@d is 3 aces|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh dear|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The brilliant Gerber convention has stopped North leading his club|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East might have said cue bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: ï don't understand why N hasn't led a @c given to the fact P didn't X 4@d|pg||

nt|vugraphzwj: (S)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but he is a p/h so it is very unlikely that he has a game try, almost as unlikely as partner actually having @hs, and this way his hand gets to be concealed if they end up ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dan_ehh: 3NT is a great spot, I agree, but only because north held the @h king. without that, it is very bad, and I think 4@h on average would be quite bad|pg||
