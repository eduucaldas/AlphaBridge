nt|mdgraham: 2@H=F******y|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT depends on how declarer views the diamond suit - China Open went down|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: In the OR East won two clubs on the lead and switched to @HK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo EW and NS both deserved this close scoring (agree?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South could just draw trumps and concede a club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @D 3-3 could easily develop the needed tricks so @HK desperate attemp to get 4@S down|pg||
