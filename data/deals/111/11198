nt|lml: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: lovely fits  here (NOT but for the @S's) |pg||
nt|udo: 7@D for NS,,,,also without @D queen not biddable|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 or 7 @D's |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: gutsy 7 |pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this is for the stratosphere|pg||
nt|lml: 7@D does require guessing the diamond suit|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,i think 6 for sure, when south learns from North the @D suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: how many clubs does S bid now?|pg||
nt|udo: 6 is ok, 7@D is not a good contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could jam the auction and fit finding |pg||
nt|lml: I think North-South will do well to get to 6@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: 2@C FOR ME ASSUMING FORCING|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: double is imo poor|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,5@D now from North ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: X didnt cross my mind,  but maybe 2 @C not forcing |pg||
nt|lml: the only reason to double is that you cant make any forcing bid in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i trust that is the answer|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|udo: diff now|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: 6@C is possible with some decent guesses|pg||
nt|udo: north will correct to @D now ? |pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt|pg||
nt|udo: me neither|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he must guess both suits|pg||
nt|udo: no|pg||
nt|udo: no guess in @C?s|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@ds go on the @hs.  Declarer can't go wrong.|pg||
nt|lml: there actually are no guesses in 6@C as was pointed out|pg||
nt|sybarra: now has to make it! |pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i see optical illusion|pg||
nt|sybarra: its ok,  hello Joe and Linda |pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|lml: after the long paude by North it made it harder for East to even consider pulling|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

nt|lml: I agree.  That was the point I was trying to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W is not a happy camper |pg||
nt|sybarra: until they discover 7 @D makes |pg||
nt|roswolf: to put it in to true perspective had I had KJx of clubs I would still have passed |pg||
mb|1C|nt|udo: of course, freely bid 6@C going down, will usually be a good score|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: that would have been much more tempting LJX|pg||
nt|lml: KJx|pg||
