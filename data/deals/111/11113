mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: yes, dbl = 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: we're talking about North Barnet|pg||

nt|onebid: 3-1 with stiff honor, or 2-2?|pg||
nt|flash: meanwhile, Jessie's busily re-entering the board scores for the session|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: perhaps on@D lead he has to play a low club from hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: and will get us to 119-96 through 14 boards to agree with the web site|pg||
nt|onebid: with either case, a club back to his hand!|pg||
