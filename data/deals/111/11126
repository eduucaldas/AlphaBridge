nt|skorchev: after interferences they play transfers here|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@cs look a nice spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: so X would show @H by W?|pg||
nt|skorchev: no, I think DBL is 5-7 any or 8+BAL and 2@D is hearts|pg||
nt|Zmud99: ok just a last minutes change - Appel comitee change result of this match : Italy got 5 IMPs less -|pg||
mb|d|nt|skorchev: but I'm not completely sure|pg||

nt|star6ija: Fantoni showed bad break with at least 1 minor|pg||
nt|skorchev: and there is no contestation?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|star6ija: Nunes did it with a heart|pg||

nt|hedyg: but Stefan said : no, I think DBL is 5-7 any or 8+BAL and 2@D is hearts|pg||
nt|skorchev: yes, but it looks very strange .... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aronov can restrict Fantoni to two trump tricks and make his contract, but even if he does he will lose IMPs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too many meanings if that is what it showed :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all i am confused by the pass over 4@S which seems to be forcing|pg||
