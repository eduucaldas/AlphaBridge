nt|joest: north might switch to a diamond looking at the spade queen|pg||

nt|joest: south probably needs extras to double on thte pattern he had|pg||

mc|7|nt|petergill: Bd 31: NS can make 8 or (more likely) 9 tricks in @h, so no big deal, going -1 in 2@S |pg||
nt|petergill: This session has raced along. The best operators are so good that we never notice them, in their error-free work - well done Jessie Carbonneaux if you are the operator.  |pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks Jessie, Perer, Ira ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks Specs|pg||
nt|petergill: Excellent bridge from Hamman  and Zia. Their team's coach Eric Kokish has a wonderful choice at the moment - 3 in-form pairs - they tend to play Nickell - Katz for the first 16 ...|pg||
nt|petergill: boards each day then HamZia with Meckwell for the last 32 boards. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 32 I meant, not Bd 31|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 32: would Zia have bid Flannery on 11 points without @DQ - when there is no split from @CKQ on the club towards dummy ... is a club to the jack as a diswcovery play ...|pg||
nt|petergill: possible...there's plenty to ponder over whether that @d guess is guessable, |pg||
nt|petergill: I mean Bd 30|pg||
nt|petergill: I mean Bd 31|pg||
