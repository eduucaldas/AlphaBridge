nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|kit: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: 4nt was no @s - @h cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Kit's team doing well in the Transnational|pg||
nt|kit: declarer far from cold here -- he could reasonably play diamond to 10 and jack, followed by passing queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Daniel|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: both pairs play strong @c and 14-16 NT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, because of the transportation issues.  This lead is best for the defense.|pg||
nt|kit: after testing spades before second diamond play of course|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, 3nt (as in OR) much easier to play.|pg||
nt|kit: nickell will have to not give away that he has the king of diamonds, but he is certainly capable of doing that|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the OR S disced a @H on the @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to keep the @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it seems the disc was premature|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the play is slower in this room with the advantage that we get comparisons|pg||
nt|cumino: K@S A@S is also possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: for doublefinesse in @D?|pg||
nt|kit: overtaking spade might well be right in 3NT, but not in 4NT|pg||
nt|barnets: the normal way to play the diamond suit is run the q and then the 10 but it is not convenient here|pg||
nt|kit: diamond to 10, then passing queen of diamonds is a double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: 4nt is a very different contract on this hand.|pg||

nt|kareno: Key play coming here.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: now he is headed down probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he will have to find the play of the A@D|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: he will of course test the spades, and when they don't split he will take the diamond finesse unless he has picked up something, for down 2 it looks like|pg||
nt|barnets: He will wish he had played 6@D which he could have also made had he guessed the diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec asking what's wrong with Ace and a small diamond.  Answer is it works less of the time than the line he has taken - and with KJ in north doesn't have a chance.|pg||

mc|8|nt|kareno: Surviving with this great guess in diamond.|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably sensed something on the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|kit: well, he got it right -- guess he was falling back on combination of heart finesse and squeeze if king of diamonds came down -- but it doesn't look percentage to me|pg||
nt|barnets: did south flicker before following on the first diamond - need to be at the table|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: another black card is good; red, bad.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|hJ|nt|kit: less nasty than a heart lead, but he still has to make some very good guesses|pg||
nt|hedyg: Barnet can tell him how..|pg||
nt|kit: East nervous about shifting to heart, as he doesn't know where the queen is|pg||
nt|barnets: just has to take to black finesses|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 3/3 could make it, so i m not confident for him|pg||
nt|barnets: easy for us|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually, looking at the result from the OR, you'd want to be in ONLY 5@c :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely @H is the only chance when you see dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, karen|pg||
nt|kit: why only chance?  It might just give declarer a heart trick|pg||
nt|kit: defense doesn't need to set up anything more|pg||
nt|hedyg: but you have no @s resistance|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure he needs to play @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer might have @HQ and no @DK, and then you want to shorten dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: you know the @ss will come in|pg||
nt|kit: nothing you can do about the spade position, whether you lead heart or not|pg||
nt|ritong: this usually is the case when you consider declaring a borderline grand, you must feel certain that small slam is played other room  here, is the same one level lower|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe playing the@H helps dec to guess trumps|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, giving north some room on this, south did make a negative double with skimpy values to say the least.|pg||
nt|barnets: and directs him to do the right thing|pg||
