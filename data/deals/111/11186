nt|daman: they each bid the game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not exactly a theory :) Practical common sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzwj: N thinking|pg||
nt|daman: the pain of missing a vul game is more than guessing whether or not you should bid it with a marginal hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nonvulnerable game requires a finesse and no more than one trump loser. Is it worth bidding?|pg||

nt|vugraphzwj: indeed|pg||
nt|daman: no reason to think that   putting cards (or lack of them) in partner's hand is masterminding|pg||
nt|daman: and now look at what has happened   |pg||

nt|ritong: 9 times out of 10, it just will help declarer in vulnerable game|pg||
nt|granguru: what about 5@C made?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: unreachable 5@D which makes by good play, in OR 4@S made after K of @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzwk: lotan is thinking noy nir|pg||

nt|april7: 8 of @D |pg||
nt|granguru: after 2@S 4@S obviously Schwartz hand was showing posibilities of playing in other suits (even @H - if not 4NT for minors) As W had @D he gave E a choice of games|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzwk: oh oh|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|april7: K of @C!!!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|granguru: considering 1N is F1 the more negative was the double over 4@S.|pg||
nt|granguru: against a F 1NT|pg||
nt|granguru: the point is mainly that x was not penalty|pg||
nt|april7: good spotcards in @C sotake advantage of it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: !|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru: 4NT would suggest playing ONLY in one minor|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sT|nt|ritong: guess lunch will be a good thing|pg||
