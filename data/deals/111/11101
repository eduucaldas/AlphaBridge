nt|andyv:  then we will just have to do with the result if you have that|pg||
nt|afulton: Ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: north open 3@C, E pass, S 3@s, W pass, N 4@h, E pass, |pg||

nt|vugraphzvs: so 6@s by south|pg||
nt|andyv:  while 13 gets straightened out, 14 is a 4@h contract that is doomed with a @c lead if S plays it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: so board 13, 6@s by south, W leads ten of @c|pg||
nt|afulton: NS play 15-17 NT, so it is unlikely that it will be played by North ... with 14, auction should go 1@C - 1@h - 3@h - 4@h |pg||
nt|andyv:  then a @d lead and @c switch will result in the same thing|pg||
nt|afulton: Yes, but North doesn't have 15... (and while the other NS might open 1N, by their CC, they shouldn't)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you open W hand in 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|afulton: Hmmm... me? no ... Peggy? maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: ace from dummy, heart to the ace, heart ruff, K@c and discard a @d and w ruf, play @s and claimed the 12 tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: Thank you Daniel for the recap! |pg||
