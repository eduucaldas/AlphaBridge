nt|vugraphzwc: hi, welcome all|pg||
nt|kareno: You are about to watch one of the world's premier pairs, e/w against a strong Polish pair, which I'm told (tell me if I am wrong) are part of the Polish national team.|pg||
nt|kareno: Tamara :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: Karen dear:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|kareno: West has values but no real lengths of suits.  |pg||
nt|kareno: Double no doubt suggests this and my guess is that east will pass unless north runs to spades now.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|kareno: So I hear that Kalita and Kotorowicz are a strong young pair|pg||
nt|kareno: And obviously playing well.  They had to be in the top eight of a large field to get to the knockout rounds.|pg||
nt|kareno: As I said, Helgemo and Helness are one of the world's best pairs.|pg||

nt|flash: in Polish Club, this sequence would usually show the weak NT hand-type?|pg||
nt|othered1: without a 9-card fit, west is ging to have to drive the hand.  East, though, has much better than expected cards in west's suits.|pg||
