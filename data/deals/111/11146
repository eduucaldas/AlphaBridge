nt|petergill: NS play Standard with very aggressive weak twos which are often 5 card suits|pg||
nt|gracelin: MaCallum-Baker play what they call aggressive Std. American|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang-Liu will reach 3Nt here but not sure they can make it.|pg||
nt|petergill: North has won five World Championships, but this is the "third pair" for USA1. China, yet to win a World Championship, is favoured by some to win this match. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: after several losses in a world championships final to te USA team, China finally beat USA in the semi-final in Beijing last year.|pg||

nt|petergill: Having a small singleton in partner's suit is a very bad feature, but almost almost all expert pairs bid these cards to 3NT. |pg||

pc|d6|nt|gracelin: I don't see declarer making this, but probably the same contract and lead in closed room|pg||
nt|petergill: According to data gathered ( I think) by Kit Woolsey in some of his educational software, a lead to 3NT from J9xx has more going for it than a lead from J8xx. |pg||
nt|gracelin: it's indeed the case here.  If north's D9 and West's D8 is changed, declarer can make a 2nd D trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Virtually all the top experts open the East cards nowadays. It gains in lots of ways to strike the first blow in the auction, the major downside being that, along with all other ...|pg||
nt|petergill: experts, you sometimes reach a light 3NT. |pg||
nt|gracelin: with 3 honor tricks and a rebiddable suit, even Culbertson will open this East hand. :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Carry forward (max 16 imps) is 1/2 of the imp margin of their earlier head-to-head match, won 25-4 VPs by China in Round 21 of the 21 qualifying matches. |pg||

nt|gracelin: now declarer might make this for a good swing.|pg||
nt|gracelin: any lead by West not only gives away a trick, but also an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: West played @HQ, the card she is known to hold, not 1HJ, to minimize giving declarer info, while her partner will not be fooled.  |pg||

nt|kareno: Multi by south, a good one as befits her vulnerabililty.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: 4@s likely contract.  E/w have a nice club fit but not much in values.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|an|!s and max|mb|p|nt|jcwla: On Board 12, where Wang ensnared herself in 4@C-5, Baker is in 3@S.  Not going to make, but can put some much-needed IMPs on the board by holding the undertricks.|pg||
nt|kareno: This is the contract where the spade break will kill n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|kareno: 4@s has some play (not much) but 3nt is dead in the water.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S down one and 9 to USA1 to pull within 24.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, a good practical 3@s bid gains a lot of IMPs on that board.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sun is thinking, to quote Irene Reilly in "A Confederacy of Dunces," "Why me, lord?  I been good."|pg||
nt|kareno: West's easy diamond pitch suggesting five card holding.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The "idle fifth" as Sabine Auken calls it.|pg||

nt|jcwla: 13 the second push at 4@S making 5.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Thanks to Felipe our excellent operator and to Patrick and to all you kibitzers for choosing our table. |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: there are 717 of them|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H weak 2 , 5 or 6 cards, 0-10|pg||
nt|petergill: East might dbl the final contract?|pg||
mb|3D!|an|min with better d than c|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|gracelin: can they reach a spade contract after this? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|nt|petergill: Unlike other commentators who follow the scripted thank yous, I like to do one line genuine thank yous, and I get away with it. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: There's that Dbl. |pg||
nt|petergill: West probably considered doubling 4@S at the other table. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: Wang is not afraid to do that.  When chances come, she grabs them.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|petergill: 3@D showed a minimum with better @D than @C. Gvien their Convention Card says 2@H 0-10 often five cards, I now like 3@H by South, which North either passes or converts to 3NT. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kareno: If west opens 2@d here, n/s could find themselves in 4@s (and they may anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I think Sun has to quit right here.|pg||
