nt|hedyg: welcome Kit|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess you are out this set, Kit?|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|kit: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: 4nt was no @s - @h cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Kit's team doing well in the Transnational|pg||
nt|kit: declarer far from cold here -- he could reasonably play diamond to 10 and jack, followed by passing queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Daniel|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, because of the transportation issues.  This lead is best for the defense.|pg||
nt|kit: after testing spades before second diamond play of course|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, 3nt (as in OR) much easier to play.|pg||
nt|kit: nickell will have to not give away that he has the king of diamonds, but he is certainly capable of doing that|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the OR S disced a @H on the @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to keep the @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: but it seems the disc was premature|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the play is slower in this room with the advantage that we get comparisons|pg||
nt|cumino: K@S A@S is also possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: for doublefinesse in @D?|pg||
nt|kit: overtaking spade might well be right in 3NT, but not in 4NT|pg||
nt|barnets: the normal way to play the diamond suit is run the q and then the 10 but it is not convenient here|pg||
nt|kit: diamond to 10, then passing queen of diamonds is a double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: 4nt is a very different contract on this hand.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: S led from a suit with no honours|pg||
nt|kit: this looks like right play in 4NT, but it may go down if he goes wrong here|pg||
nt|kareno: Key play coming here.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: now he is headed down probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he will have to find the play of the A@D|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: he will of course test the spades, and when they don't split he will take the diamond finesse unless he has picked up something, for down 2 it looks like|pg||
nt|barnets: He will wish he had played 6@D which he could have also made had he guessed the diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec asking what's wrong with Ace and a small diamond.  Answer is it works less of the time than the line he has taken - and with KJ in north doesn't have a chance.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ritong: !|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: well!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Surviving with this great guess in diamond.|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably sensed something on the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|kit: well, he got it right -- guess he was falling back on combination of heart finesse and squeeze if king of diamonds came down -- but it doesn't look percentage to me|pg||
nt|barnets: did south flicker before following on the first diamond - need to be at the table|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: but this needs great self confidence in your table presence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: S is not on his side of the screen|pg||

nt|cumino: J on side, K second or spade 3-3. Not sure is more than mounting the spade and double finesse in Diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes.  Now let's see if Ralph Katz balances|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: Right distribution and decent values.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: clear balance -- letting opponents play at 2-level when short in their suit is a no-no|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|kit: The bid question is whether or not Nickell, with Axx in hearts, will compete to 3@S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|barnets: 4@S requires tht e/w cant take 2@D tricks and here they cant |pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: I think Katz has bid his hand -- he doesn't know what his partner has in hearts.  Nickell does know.|pg||
nt|kareno: South's balanced hand dissuaded him from bidding again but they can make 3@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: Katz could have 2 @hs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: he could, but even if he does 3@S could be right, and considering enemy bidding he probably has stiff|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: basically on one of two red-suit finesses, unless defense can get a club trick by club lead |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Duboin bid 2NT with the S hand...must be conventional|pg||
nt|kareno: Defense might just lead a club right now.|pg||
nt|kit: never a move.  I know I wouldn't have given up so quickly with the North hand, but Katz was right this time.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H is gf, am i the only 1 to bid 4@h over 2@H with the S hand?|pg||
nt|kit: opening led won't matter on this layout I don't believe|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade void is a big deterrant.|pg||
nt|ritong: they certainly have a two gears slam approach here, but the @s void inclined katz to use none|pg||
nt|barnets: I like 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: No, it shouldn't.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: most play 4@H jump by South is a bad hand, and Nickell certainly doesn't have that.|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct 4 @H would show a weak opening with 4 @hs no shape|pg||
nt|hedyg: he cant have much less?|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to judge though if all north needs is the @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: better without a side ace|pg||
nt|kit: now, will declarer take the safety play of going up ace of clubs, guarding against 7-1 clubs and both red kings off|pg||
nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|kareno: I think no.|pg||
nt|kit: South can have a ton less -- he might have only 3 trumps, his trump queen might be elsewhere, he might have junk instead of 2 aces|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Yes, he did present a lovely dummy|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: Going down would take such a parly I would let club ride -- also, is it so safe anyway -- suppose hearts 4-0|pg||

nt|hedyg: works well vs psyches|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable, no less :(|pg||
nt|kareno: I double if they psych - I think it shows the suit bid|pg||
nt|kit: I play it natural showing 5 hearts (double with 4), and opener's suit only Q-bid, but that is just a personal preference|pg||
nt|barnets: they need to discuss playing in cue bids with versace lauria|pg||
nt|kareno: You must have an understanding|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like to play it like Kit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet is referring to 2@D-4 vulnerable in the previous set|pg||
nt|kareno: I see :)  I wasn't in this room that set.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows no 4 @hs in S so no void in W|pg||

nt|kit: it also makes it safer to overcall in that partner can't have the strength to bury you|pg||
nt|ritong: an other point of view|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps it's not that important what *we* would have done since we are not playing. If it is their style not to overcall with a hand like that, you just have to accept that it is|pg||
