pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|athene: do you lead to the @DQ10x or take a double finesse?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|doctorone: A @c lead may create some problems|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead small towards dummy and south plays low smoothly, you put @D10 in, lose to the @DJ, then run the @DQ next time|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|santyclz: If I take the dbl-finesse, I start with the 10 in case n shows out or the 10 holds.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lc: 3NT by East, we presume is next.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: Surely, if E-W reach slam, the will fail on this layout.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|lc: So, a slight + position for Italy, here.|pg||
nt|swanson: Looks like a sensible, controlled auction and the best game (spades having been bid by North).|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rusinow lead from known length|pg||

pc|d2|nt|santyclz: No, not with 2 side aces.  If the @hs had the ace and a side suit the q, yes.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|athene: NS convention card says 2/1 only forcing one round|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but surely opener has enough for game facing a 2@H response so 3@H had to be forcing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: and presumably showed better than minimum|pg||

nt|swanson: Only 8 tricks after a spade lead because declarer must knock out both the @DA and @HK (or a club).|pg||

nt|ndemirev: 6@D would be a good spot here |pg||
nt|lc: Laydown unless 3-0 ! as here.|pg||
nt|lc: 3-0 @D a problem -- especially if declarer starts them with the @DK from dummy.|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe East will get in the auction which will help declarer in the play.|pg||
nt|lc: Note to all partnerships watching:  Be sure you know what 1@D PASS 3@H means in your system!|pg||
mb|2D|an|F1|nt|bigtrain: 2@D = NAT, one round force|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ndemirev: then it becomes a problem with no solution :) |pg||
nt|barnets: that helps|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer will now guess @Ds|pg||
nt|lc: Most inexperienced players thing that the fact that East bid means you should play him for the HCP -- thus the missing @DQ.|pg||
nt|lc: BUt -- it is quite the opposite,.|pg||
nt|lc: The bidder in auctions like this is bidding typically because of shape.|pg||
nt|swanson: Now a good declarer will make the slam, guessing both diamonds and which finesse to take.|pg||
mb|4H|an|RKC for diamonds|nt|lc: The @DQ would be a reason NOT to bid.  Short @D the reason TO bid.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: RKC-@D|pg||
nt|lc: So, Meckwell on their way to 1370, I suspect.|pg||
nt|lc: @H lead, @D guess, and claim  (declarer ruffs 2 losing major cards in dummy).|pg||

nt|lc: So, Lauria's interference will cost him big time.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: This is annoying for declarer.|pg||

nt|ndemirev: there is a squeeze - interesting sort |pg||

nt|gluckenval: si|pg||
nt|saverio: quindi il passo è forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H response to multi is "pass or correct" - and the normal meaning of south's double is t/o of hearts|pg||

nt|lc: East hand too heavy for 1@H-4@H|pg||

nt|lc: Although all participants have to post their system, very few are dilligent/thorough.|pg||
nt|lc: And the WBF is lax about enforcment.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: "not very strong", added Versace, "9-12", to what he wrote (and I transcribed above)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|swanson: Will N-S find their way to a spade slam - will E-W take the 7@H save?  How many spades will South bid here?|pg||

nt|swanson: 5@H is an interesting bid here by North.|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 6s|pg||
nt|lc: Not only the specs, but John told us 20 lines ago.|pg||
nt|barnets: he plays it canny|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is no reason to bid over 5 though |pg||
nt|lc: But, have pity on we poor commentators who can't read and type simultaneously.|pg||
nt|ndemirev: and that is not quite clear as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Meckstroth asked whether Versace knows the shortness, got no for an answer|pg||
mb|5S|nt|swanson: The usual object on these hands is simply to buy the contract at a safe level.  Both sides know their defense is spotty.|pg||
nt|ritong: looks more like1050|pg||
nt|lc: Likely 1050 coming ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: That is 5@S X VUL making 6.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: yes. X|pg||
nt|lc: Lauria has 2 aces and his partner opened -- he X's!!|pg||
nt|lc: He will say after the hand, "Sorry pard, if I had 2 more aces, we could have beaten it."|pg||
nt|ndemirev: I think he is b/n pass and 6h rather than dbl and pass |pg||
nt|lc: As John pointed out long ago, "PAR" on this board is 7@H doubled by E-W.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: I believe Lauria Versace invert the meaning of pass/double here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|ritong: theoretical par|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|swanson: An initial 3@S or 3NT response by East (showing shortness) seems more to the point.|pg||

nt|rialc2: e allora va down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tax456: magari fosse cosi|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: now East has quite a lot she might want to say - extra values (XX?), 6th spade (2@S?)|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now south might be wondering what pass means - is it to play (diamonds) or just neutral?|pg||
nt|athene: this issue has come up a few times over the past weeks|pg||
nt|athene: all serious partnerships should discuss when a pass after a t/o double and a redouble IS a penalty pass|pg||
nt|athene: it's standard to play it neutral at the 1-level and penalties at the 3-level, i think - but there's a big nebulous area in the middle :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: Good point Bill... However, my policy in these situations is avoid accidents if not discussed... So whatever pass means I wont sit as N|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: there was a hand in the English Premier League a while back, i remember, which led to 2@DXX+2 on exactly this misunderstanding|pg||
nt|santyclz: From the length of the huddle it would appear they use it as penalty.|pg||
nt|athene: well, this will likely end things, for a flat board|pg||
nt|santyclz: But note that they are actually bidding @cs!|pg||
nt|doctorone: someone is still thinking it seems, and likely E...|pg||
nt|rcerreto: ti sta accontentando|pg||
pc|sK|nt|doctorone: ah !|pg||
nt|santyclz: Could be n, s could have quite a few @cs since n didn't promise many.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|vincenzo: ora si|pg||
pc|c8|nt|doctorone: N may be given away too much information to allow a correct play in @ds?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: good chances to get the diamonds right now|pg||
nt|athene: would north really bid 4@C with @DQx?|pg||
nt|doctorone: I think N did too much|pg||
nt|vincenzo: un'altra boccata di ossigeno|pg||
nt|rialc2: vi avevo detto che sulle ultime non si perdeva: adesso vediamo se si guadagna|pg||
nt|rialc2: @D|pg||

nt|rialc2: no 6 prese gli spettano|pg||
nt|arrigo: gli ho risposto|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 9 per noi|pg||
nt|gluckenval: non ha 3 scarti comodissimi il dichiarante|pg||
nt|rialc2: è vero|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 390|pg||
nt|rialc2: dopo le @C : @S e così va -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto: esagerato|pg||
nt|vincenzo: 290 vero|pg||
nt|rialc2: 390 era ancora meglio|pg||
nt|tax456: zia non mi pare in palla|pg||
nt|rialc2: adesso socmpare tutto|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||

pc|c5|nt|rcerreto: un turno in cui si sono visti più errori del solito, la stanchezza inizia ad incidere|pg||

nt|lc: Yes, I'm told.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: when jeff meckstroth is south, boards come at high speed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: walter, was it that they pass bad 11 or that is history, or my evaluation is outdated?|pg||
nt|lc: So, since we are winding down, and about to lose everyone ....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|swanson: That result suits my sense of justice after opening the South hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: where us a made 1050 italy x 5@H instead of bidding 5@S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: vulnerable, 11s are optional in first seat...  meck never seems to dislike his 11s though|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: sementa overclled 2@C and then backtracked after that|pg||
nt|lc: As Meck card says, "frequent upgrades, rare downgrades." :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Lauria leaving the room now|pg||
nt|lc: Lauria often does that on last deal.  Is there any one to turn the dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably has not quit smoking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i actually remember him downgrading a hand with me about 15 years ago|pg||
nt|lc: Lorenzo needs a smoke.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: no|pg||
nt|lc: Awkward to leave with no dummy turner.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|ndemirev: maybe have to switch that "always" and "never" :) |pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, this match continues with 48 tomorrow and 32 on Saturday.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lc: Thanks to the so many that make this possible.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Remember that we will be showing a segment from the transnational quarter-final where Helness-Helgemo and Balicki-Zmudzinski are involved. Starting in about 1 hour 55 minutes. That ...|pg||
