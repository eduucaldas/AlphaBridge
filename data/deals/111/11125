nt|lc: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: welcome|pg||
nt|lc: Looks like a chance to start with what is commonly called a "Polish 2-bid" -- opening 2@S to show 5@S and 5-minor.|pg||
mb|2S|an|!S+m|mb|3C|nt|lc: There you have it.|pg||
nt|lc: Berk could have overcalled 4NT for minors -- but goes slowly.|pg||
nt|lc: Markowitz will likely bid 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc: Now, Lair can X to show cards|pg||
nt|lc: E-W could easily reach slam.|pg||
nt|lc: Lair has many choices available here -- could X, Could bid 5@C, maybe 5@H.|pg||
nt|lc: 6@C looks to be the best E-W spot|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lc: Berk will have to decide if he should raise himself to slam.|pg||
nt|lc: He knows @D are splitting poorly from the auction.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, he took the low road.|pg||
nt|lc: In general, when there is a LOW road or HIGH road, Berk prefers low.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: So, this will be easy 12 tricks, maybe 13 -- and a poor position for USA2.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lc: By the way, is anyone else with me other than Tamara?  Or am I solo?|pg||
nt|lc: Aside from the 243 of you watching  -- thanks. :)|pg||
nt|lc: I know that the allure is with the "OPEN" -- but I'll try to keep you entertained if you stay tuned to this station. :)|pg||
nt|lc: If nothing else, this match is closer.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: Had North covered, it would have been 13 fast ones.|pg||
nt|lc: The only danger for declarer in 5@C is 5-0 @C break -- I suppose that is what is taking so long here.|pg||
nt|lc: He knows North has 5+@S and 5+@D from the opening bid.|pg||
nt|lc: It would be nice if we could just tell him to play quickly.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lc: He is playing this way in case South has all 5 clubs.  |pg||
nt|lc: Now, he might make only 11 tricks and it will feel better. WOn't feel like he missed a making slam. :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lc: But, I suspect he will still take 12.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lc: He can ruff a @S, ruff a @D (South can't beat dummy) -- and still take the rest for 420.|pg||
nt|lc: Berk will be disappointed when he sees @C were 3-2 all along.|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: u are right, Larry|pg||
nt|lc: Berk probably would not have, but Lair is less conservative.|pg||

nt|lc: Here, E-W have nice fit in @H and @C, but it will never see the light of day.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lc: So, on this deal, preempting was not best -- the danger was missing a better spot, and that is waht happened.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: Flat shape -- poor @S holding - -not appealing to try for 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Lead?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc: Looks like -50, but not so bad for N-S as E-W might have a VUL game.|pg||
nt|lc: The question is, can E-W handle 4@H if they reach it?|pg||
nt|lc: I think 5@C would be easier.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lc: Def will get 1 in each suit here -- unless there is an endplay.|pg||
nt|lc: Def has to somehow get the @S trick without getting endplayed.|pg||
nt|lc: They can do it in that declarer has to ruff one @H in dummy, and then when East gets in he will always have safe exit in @H.|pg||
nt|lc: West has to resist urge to win this and play a @S -- East would ruff with his natural trump trick as @S loser vasnishes.|pg||

nt|lc: Even if East had enterred the auction, it is still unlikely (probably even LESS likely) that declarer would guess @D.|pg||

nt|lc: Simplest chance is @HKxx (or @HKx) with EAST.  |pg||

nt|lc: Markowitz didn't bid 2@D -- so hard to figure this out.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: Would declarer play @D himself with xx opp KQ doub?|pg||
nt|lc: As we see, Lair didn't believe it was Berk who had 2@D and declarer 4@D.|pg||
nt|lc: Now, declarer has to be careful to draw one more trump before ruffing his @D in dummy.|pg||
nt|henryb: but could berk have played 98 from 10965?|pg||
nt|lc: We see that with @H running he can draw all the trump, but he won't do that.|pg||
nt|lc: Berk played 9-6, I believe.|pg||
nt|henryb: 96 from 10965?????????|pg||
nt|lc: With 10-9-6-5  he would probably play 9 then 5.|pg||
nt|henryb: seems improbable|pg||
nt|lc: But, at this stage, after 10 days, it is hard to notice these things.|pg||

nt|stewball: i'm told rodwell forced to game in a similar situation|pg||
nt|stewball: with the N hand|pg||
nt|lc: Well, Meck 1@C opening guaranteed a big @C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Last board, tks all, back after a small break|pg||
nt|lc: Looks like trump leads are needed to prevent E-W from making FOUR @H.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lc: Flannery.|pg||
nt|lc: And a heavy one at that.|pg||
nt|stewball: trump start to beat 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lc: Surely, without trump plays declarer does well.|pg||
nt|lc: Yes, I think you are right, John -- trump might beat THREE.|pg||
nt|stewball: easy from S no?|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer has 5@H, eventually 3@D -- and needs to ruff spades in East hand.|pg||
nt|gosia: standard defense against Flannery|pg||
nt|lc: Indeed|pg||
nt|lc: Lead trumps against Flannery.|pg||
nt|lc: Meanwhile, Lair seems to be thinking of violating a basic principle.|pg||
nt|stewball: 3@d coming...|pg||
nt|lc: Usually, once you have described your hand, you are done.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lc: East could have   @S x  @H xx  @D Jxxx  @C Qxxxxxx  for all West knows.|pg||
nt|stewball: could be cold for @d slam:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, maybe if he thinks he is good enough to bid again, he was too good for Flannery.|pg||
nt|lc: On the other hand, I do understand his auction.|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: So, Markowitz indeed finds the "marked" trump lead.|pg||
nt|lc: "Marked" by Mark Lair.|pg||
nt|stewball: so another good result for the poles|pg||
nt|lc: Oyyy -- sorry about that.  :(|pg||
nt|lc: You would think the defense, on the right track here will get in 3 rounds of @H. in time.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|lc: They have to be careful to have NORTH win the 3rd round of @S.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lc: Will be easy for North to win 2nd @S now.|pg||

nt|lc: So, this will be 6 to POLAND and they will trail by only 2 IMPS with 16 to go.|pg||
nt|lc: In 30 minutes the final segments begin (although I suspect there were some concessions).|pg||
nt|lc: We have 3 blowouts and 3 close matches.|pg||
nt|lc: This is the closest match.|pg||
nt|lc: China lead France in the Venice by 24 -- winner to play USA1 in Women's final.|pg||
nt|lc: ITaly-USA will be Bermuda Bowl final (both with insurmountable leads).|pg||
