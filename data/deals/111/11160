mb|3H|nt|junior: Here we have a normal 1S opening, and a somewhat light "big double" by Helness|pg||
mb|d|nt|junior: by big double, I mean a hand which would normally overcall but is too strong to do so|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|junior: The North hand would be an overcall for a majority of the world's top 100 partnerships, IMO|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand isn't quite strong enough for a 1@C opener in the other room?  (Polish Club for E-W there??)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: I try to be as accurate as our Brazilian team here :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|junior: The defense will lead a high heart and shift to trumps, and declarer will be unable to set up his clubs or ruff them in dummy|pg||

nt|junior: This is interesting, although 3N is also slated to fail on a diamond lead|pg||
