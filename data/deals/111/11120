nt|cindy:  should show a doubleton @s though|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|othered1: using 2N as a forcing bid has merit.|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cindy:  whats wrong with 3@d ?|pg||
nt|othered1: as would I, but it's a matter of style and context of the rest of the system|pg||
nt|cindy:  looks like a pretty normal jump shift to me|pg||
nt|othered1: For me 3@D would be game forcing and a bit stronger|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3@d creates a game force when you don't know where you are going|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: If partner passes 2@d it is likely to be right, if not, I can now make another move|pg||
nt|othered1: How lightly you open 2@C on a suit hand may affect your range for jump shifts|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This would show a hand, slightly less than a game force|pg||
nt|cindy:  i guess im more optimistic than you guys|pg||
nt|cindy:  if partner responds, im forcing to game|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It also depends on what your requirements are to respond|pg||
nt|othered1: Ok, they play transfers over 2N, so south showed @C and north rejected|pg||

nt|sssvablue: I think for mercy reasons we should forget that auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: directors called the players to solve the problem outside the room|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's a retransfer, either they haven't a method to show a red 2-suiter, perhaps a price they used to be willing to play.  Maybe no longer.|pg||
