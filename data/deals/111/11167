nt|ady: 11 tricks closed room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Italy (Garozzo-Belladonna) bid and made 7@C with a trump suit of AQ opposite J98xxx|pg||
nt|athene: of course hallberg plays low at trick 1 - his partner can't have the @DA, so playing the @DK can only help declarer|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a kib jokes that he always knew they were just lucky :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: south's idea is, even if this finesse loses, he can pitch a spade on the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: so this is the best shot for 12 (not seeing all the cards)|pg||
nt|ady: Romanski tried club finesse    better odds than bringing king down in 2 or 3 eith east|pg||
nt|athene: now he may play @HA, @SA, @CA throwing spade, spade ruff, trump to dummy, 13th spade pitching the diamond|pg||

nt|athene: the theory being that if you have four spades, and the overcaller has hearts, you can afford to wait|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|dburn: someone informs me that double is actually takeout of spades|pg||

nt|doctorone: I think that they defend this as they do versus 2@d multi, so indeed, X is T/O of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if doubkle showed four hearts, Hallberg knows that Holland holds spades |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|athene: (if that's what their puppet sequence reveals)|pg||
nt|dburn: he may refuse to lead at all|pg||
nt|doctorone: :)|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ?|pg||
nt|dburn: but the nine of spades may be his preferred candidate, or even the jack|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a diamond |pg||
nt|doctorone: maybe a @s 9 (known a s the bad luck card in some countries)....|pg||
nt|athene: on the principle of "partner didn't double 3@C"|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|athene: but you know partner is almost never going to have enough to double anything for the lead anyway|pg||
nt|athene: the @S9 is a bad luck card? not heard that one before|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: not sure about that, but maybe North could be stronger|pg||
nt|doctorone: That is a surprising action by S... depends on which range 2N was of course, but a 10 balanced count |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: maybe @CAK and another|pg||
nt|dburn: this has become a bit fraught for Kowalski now|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like Mr Micawber|pg||
nt|athene: i think @CAK and another club is the best chance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could play three more hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: but east leading dummy's known suit suggests he had a hard hand to lead from |pg||
nt|dburn: and West won't like those very much, but still...|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer surely puts him with the minor-suit queens|pg||

nt|athene: but east wld have led a minor with nothing in the suit, surely|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe and maybe not - leading dummy's long suit (and declarer's short suit) is not a bad move|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 pitch shows the @SJ lead was "strange"|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|doctorone: and there is no indication for N that E hasent led a @s from J1098, which look safe?|pg||
nt|athene: this might work in the defence's favour|pg||
nt|doctorone: now yes|pg||
nt|athene: he might think it has to be @SJx|pg||
