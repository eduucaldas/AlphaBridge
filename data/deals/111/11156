nt|chick: I'm not sure why E upgraded that to a 2N opener, I think 1@D would be normal|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi cindy.. just in time to scratch your head:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  it does seem peculiar|pg||
nt|cindy:  hand missorted ?|pg||
nt|chick: agree with that also, seems a simple transfer hand, but if she expects 20-21, may have slam in mind|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: it might seem at first that E may have upgraded because of the score, hoping for a swing. but the best way to do that is open 1D and hope for a better auction. 2N is Buffy the ...|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|an|int or more|mb|p|nt|jwit:  Can't splinter very easily over a 1H response|pg||
nt|jwit:  However.......|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jwit:  Interesting that Shawn would choose 2D over 1H playing 5 card majors, but I guess she had bigger things in mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is dealer :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jwit:  Woops., sorry about that lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: straightforward 4@S losing @DA, @D ruff, and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure they will diagnose lots of slow values in side-suits and go for 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: even with the 5-5 diamond fit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jwit:  They both have a little extra, so not so sure, but we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another strange blind spot there at trick one, by E. since you want to be in your hand to lead trumps, why win the spade in dummy? now she had to burn her precious diamond king. |pg||
nt|jwit:  3H bid will certainly turn Pam off|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jwit:  However, that bid will not discourage Shawn|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jwit:  With her prime hand|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: i was sure 3NT was going to end the auction there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but suddenly they woke up!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit:  Certainly looking at both hands you would swim a river of crocodiles to be in 6D|pg||
nt|jwit:  However, with 3-0 trumps, will not be a walk in the partk, and will be down off the top if they misguess trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: yes, even if you pick trumps, you're a trick short|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: drawing three rounds leaves only two trumps in each hand and you need three ruffs|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: there are potential finesses in all the side-suits|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: but no way declarer is finessing the heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|jwit:  Finessing the heart is no longer an option.  In retrospect a very good return by East|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can see it's cold on 2-1 trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|athene: even with 3-0, she has spade finesse, ruffing @HQ down, or double ruffing club finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: in general, you leave a finesse as the last thing to try, because you can attempt to ruff out high cards elsewhere without losing the lead|pg||
nt|jwit:  She had to start by going the right way in trumps to have any chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|athene: yes, you certainly feel good about 1370 on that board|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jwit:  Interesting 2S bid rather than 1S, but it actually puts a lot of pressure on West|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt must be a heart raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jwit:  East will want no part of game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: club lead, spade return|pg||
nt|jwit:  And 2S bid rather than 1S, will make guessing trumps a very tough proposition|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence can get a crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: south rises @HA first trump, spade ruff, club ruff|pg||
nt|jwit:  If they don't get their ruffs that is|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy:  well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: north might return a club to make certain of south getting a ruff, though, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: east has to work out which card creates uncertainty in north's mind|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jwit:  First of all, she has to play the A rather than the J, but it seems more likely partner has a stiff club than Qxx|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: she could drop the @CQ IF south would lead @C4 from @C743|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: 5C on here with right guesses|pg||
nt|cindy:  i can understand why N reopened with a double|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy:  but not so sure i would pass 3@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  and what about S?   would you bid 3@h with that hand ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  the preempt caused problems like it is supposed to|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D has some tactical appeal since pd is a passed hand, in that preempts should be variable in strength esp at these colors. even so, i think 2D is better because_ (a) this could ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easily be yr hand in 3N even facing a PH; (b) spades are out of the bag and u do not mind opps landing in hearts, so motivation for preemption not strong|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: N has to reopen with D as S might have them down several with no game on. but passing hoping that exactly 3H is your best spot seems like trying to hit too narrow a target|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|nt|athene: right, sensible route to one down here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: and if North CAN pass with that hand, then S would be better advised to bid 4C as you suggested|pg||

nt|athene: she probably felt happier when north responded 1@S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky auction here|pg||
nt|jwit:  I would have Michaels despite the weak hand with 6-5.  If partner fits one of your suits you're golden, but she was right on this hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is the sort of "expert" bid that people find in magazine bidding forums|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: and north could have passed it but felt obliged to give a courtesy raise|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jwit:  I like 3C.  Sometimes partner is 5-5 instead of 5-3, in which case missing a game is a definite possibility|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|athene: true, your main worry is the 5-5 with partner, when 5@C might be there|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: but that's the only likely game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: stiff diamond means that suit is very unlikely to prove a trick source for 3NT|pg||

nt|chick: 3@S presumably a splinter|pg||
nt|jstokes: I'm told in the BB USA play both 5@SX and 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Meck doubled in 5@S (+1), Zia doubled in 5@H making on a squeeze|pg||
nt|jstokes: Interesting tactic by Willard|pg||
nt|chick: passing? :)|pg||
nt|jstokes: Goldberg alone knows about both big fits -- |pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, of course Willard doesn't know about the 3 spades and good diamonds here partner has, but it will be strange if the spades never get mentioned|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk10: Daylight robbery uf Willard remains silent|pg||
nt|Walddk10: *if|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jstokes: I wonder what 3NT was (serious slam try? mild slam try?)|pg||
nt|chick: not an easy bid .. N only overcalled, and in a misfit suit, and S has only the spades, not knowing if fit|pg||
nt|jstokes: that's true, and the singleton spade in E might mean a bad break, but still.....|pg||
nt|jstokes: I don't think 3NT is a psych; either slam try or a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Tamara, was 3@S alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: no, it wasnt, they called the TD|pg||
nt|Walddk10: ahhhh|pg||
nt|jstokes: ah, now we have a problem (good call,Bart)|pg||
nt|Walddk10: That explains Willard's silence|pg||
nt|dburn: if West thinks 3@s is a fit jump, she is well worth a try with 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: S asked what means and wasnt satisfied with the answer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk10: although it must have seemed strange if 3@S was natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|jstokes: yes, if a fit jump or shortness, I think West has a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, it would have seemed so to South - perfectly reasonable to West|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: and the French prevail on this one, and likely for the Bronze Medal|pg||
nt|dburn: but no harm done - North-South have sorted it out, and that should be enough|pg||
nt|Walddk10: So another 17 IMP swing|pg||
nt|dburn: even if Cronier, confused by the whole business, takes some other bid, that will just increase the North-South score|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jwit:  There she goes!|pg||

nt|athene: but that's life|pg||
nt|jwit:  Problem with doubling on KQ32 is you have no other cards and you know they are in the slam range, and if they have a 7 or 8 card club fit, you're not crazy about defending 4C XX.|pg||

nt|jwit:  But that is the  pessimist in me speaking|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: on 27 after the 3H picture bid, it seems the 4D bid by N was rather timid. you have a game facing just:   xx  Ax  Kxxxxx  xxx, for example,|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk12: However, very few would be able to redouble for business at that level|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think people are going to play 4@CXX very often after transfer and super-accept|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: same spec from Toulouse reports that Italians also use that treatment, and Duboin bid 3H which enables his partner to bid 5D|pg||
