nt|vugraphzwk: Liran is shouting realy loud on Gila|pg||
nt|garnetts: On a serious note--it is usually right to try and establish a long suit--but North failed to count his tricks because after the lead he can give up two hearts and claim |pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--it was a bit mean of me--but that sort of error in card play is pretty fundamental--especially when you have the opps on the rocks|pg||
