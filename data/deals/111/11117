mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: north might try something here|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: probably 2@C is a convention, asking |pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not too much trying|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: so maybe he will show invitational with 5@H ?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: not really suited hand for passing 1NT though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but S will show as minamal as possible|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: 2@H now|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: and all pass maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y likely|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: not sure what north/south use here,  common nowadays is that 2@D is obligated , showing any invitational and 2@D directly used as GF|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: anyway north showed 5@H invitational and south either showed 2 of 3 @H|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: depending the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: play more interesting now maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think howed 2@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|bobdrijver: might be tempted leading a low @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|bobdrijver: trying to take a ruff in dummy or setting up a @S , depending if opponents play trump or @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i never quess:)|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: so will take 6@H , 1@S and 1@C at least for making|pg||
