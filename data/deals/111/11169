nt|desert: the expected 3@S bid by Piekarek in board 4 pushed NS over the limit and germany wins 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: W may be wondering also :)|pg||
nt|salokin: because Pepsi didnt raise directly so Gawris thught he might have only 3-c support|pg||
nt|chick: probably|pg||
nt|salokin: also (i do not their system for sure) but normally doubling and bidding a suit promisses a strong hand 17+ HCP|pg||

pc|c2|nt|salokin: E thought that W is probably 5@S and 4@H so a 4@H contrakt does not need to much to make ...|pg||
nt|salokin: one problem is that W has only one bid to invite over 3@D and that is 3@H so no relation about suits|pg||
nt|desert: Do you think that Double would have been penalties after 3@D?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|salokin: IN CR it was not, but that is what it is usually at least PEN suggestion|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|salokin: If there are other bids to invite then a double after a raise is for penalties|pg||
nt|salokin: If there is no room :  1@S (2@H) 2@S (3@H) double is INVIT to game in @S|pg||
