nt|petergill: We all can see what West should lead, but it is a tough lead to find|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, Peter, agree.  I will always bid 3C with south's hand|pg||
nt|daman: 6NT is obtuse|pg||
nt|petergill: He might  even lead a low heart, hoping for Kx in dummy opposite Jxx|pg||
nt|april7: and he might even lead ace of @H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT is because he could see a @D loser in a 5-3 fit, and West knows that South knew they were off @DQ and 1HA since he can see both cards|pg||

nt|gracelin: even an overtricks for 3 imps|pg||

nt|petergill: play in 6@D. |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: no   but on the auction the @D Q cannot be well placed from West's standpoint   and  North did bid 3@H on a blind auction|pg||

nt|petergill: minor suit aces (and more) for slam. Not merely a tricky hand to bid, but a very tricky hand to bid accurately. The other table punted and drew well. |pg||
