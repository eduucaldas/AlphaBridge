mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: Welcome David... Yes u r right|pg||
nt|royhughes: Precision, I am told|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: combined with random acts of aggression|pg||
nt|doctorone: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: hence North, facing a limited opening bid, did not investigate a diamond slam, nor whether a diamond game might be better than a notrump game|pg||
nt|dburn: however, this double may cause a rethink|pg||
nt|royhughes: Willard can see NS don't have full values, but it may be difficult to beat 3N|pg||
nt|doctorone: difficult to say who is in danger here... :) Declarer may bridg this home|pg||
nt|dburn: it may, but North's spades are not such as to inspire confidence in 3NT|pg||
nt|doctorone: certainly|pg||
nt|royhughes: I can imagine Cronier not enjoying seeing partner's double card|pg||
nt|dburn: but North's precipitate approach has left her unable to determine that South has a fifth diamond|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: if she could redouble to show doubt, she would, but that may not be in the playbook|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: I guess she didnt care about 5 card @D|pg||

pc|dA|nt|kareno: I understand the 2@d response was forced.|pg||
