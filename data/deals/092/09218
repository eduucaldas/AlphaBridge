mb|p|nt|robinswr: especially when hearts are clearly the trump suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 6@H here|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||

nt|0    green: well more than 6@s goes down, lets see if they get eager to go for granslam|pg||
nt|chick: the ruffing finesse in hearts works to pitch clubs, but declarer may try the losing black suit finesses instead|pg||
nt|aruf: can make 6 @s|pg||
nt|chick: no, actually I'm wrong, can't pitch enough clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: double @d finesse would work|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|0    green: even stoping on 4@s will bring IMP's cause another room slam went down, a kibizer jsut told me|pg||

nt|0    green: sry N's play|pg||

nt|chick: another example of why leading from QJx(x) is a real loser|pg||
nt|0    green: leading singleton @C was better, cause S had a 2@D bid|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|vugraphzkf: he hasnt enough entries to play Axx@h for W|pg||
nt|chick: although he could ruff this heart, and then finesse the next one|pg||
nt|chick: singleton @HA in W is very unlikely, but still a good safety play for that 1% of the time|pg||
