mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and on a club lead, declarer can set up the suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: the "best" lead may be an impossible @CQ|pg||

nt|mich-b: with a trump coup for improved satisfaction :)|pg||
nt|skorchev: I'm asked what system Popov-Andonov play at the other table, they play precision so I guess it is an operator mistake, the auction in board 3 I mean|pg||
nt|olson: it was  marked  once  S  had  6h  4c and  3c  :)|pg||
nt|olson: 4d|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4H!|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||

nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

mb|1C!|an|Precision Club- 16+p, ANY|nt|athene: if i held the south hand and partner opened a 15-17 nt i would bid 3nt and wish him lots of luck|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||

nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: will they fight on 5-level here?|pg||

nt|viren169: tough 4@H for E/W to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C for N-S if they do, possibly|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16 NT|nt|cicus: 4@D as fit-showing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: once W bids @s E has a great hand, or so he thinks|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: Szalay trying to slow down the bidding biut can't|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did you consider the reverse even borderline with that honor structure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it wasn't completely bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a great hand on pds 1@h opening|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I prefer 3@H here|pg||
nt|viren169: by West|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the club void facing no strength |pg||
nt|viren169: all too late she cried!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead was required to set this|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't bother with 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: silva is not happy with previous board|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make, i suppose, if declarer picked things right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||

nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||

nt|cicus: probably, I know no standard interpretation for that|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|othered1: 13 top tricks and lots of high cards.  Still, many don't like to bid 7 unless they can count 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: they say leave the 5 level for the opps!|pg||

nt|hedyg: desperately looking for a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East should protect over weak 2@H more difficult over multi|pg||
nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||
nt|othered1: A relay system should handle this trivially in about 12 rounds of bidding|pg||
nt|santyclz: By next Tuesday.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||
nt|athene: passing the multi was also worth considering and might have worked out well|pg||
nt|santyclz: How about 3@h xx?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cicus: no, it is 5-5 GF|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what is north thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that wld be lots of fun|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little care required but always 8  tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: good match, good bridge|pg||
nt|athene: boo|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|ady: south for the time being assumed a weak hand opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: flat, 6@H in the OR|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|viren169: North needs to be careful not to concede an overtrick...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would make an early @d pitch, hoping declarer has the j.|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws a diamond, he will have to give a trick to the @CK for +1|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cicus: if you don't play wash in Hungary you'll be not allowed in high society|pg||
nt|athene: east seems fated, whenever his partner opens 1nt, to have an 8-count|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT by north would be the best chance for game|pg||
nt|athene: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: use stayman, fail to find a fit, and go down in 2nt or 3nt :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: but still the bid sh be alerted - Hungary is not the World :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this board will turn things around|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 3 10s this time.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: lol Gabor|pg||
nt|athene: only two obvious losers (@CK @HA) but nothing like 11 winners|pg||
nt|athene: just @D @D @H to lose|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: if you ruff enough hearts the @C10 grows up for the defence's third trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: maybe the operator missed it|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes they get sloppy with their alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: or maybe they have done so earlier and now opps know so no need to keep alerting the same bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have to confess I don't understand the 3@s bid.|pg||

pc|c9|nt|cicus: best return|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: a trump back now and declarer has to just concede two heart tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Balanced hand, lousy suit, good defensive values it doesn't seem right to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I just saw a revoke.... (pessanha ruffed the @d)|pg||
nt|ady: South has shown up with enough to suppose north has king of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: So I can´t continue playing the cards...|pg||
nt|ady: what happens in that instand?|pg||
nt|ady: instant|pg||
nt|santyclz: So -3 instead of -2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||

nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|athene: north might double i suppose after 1@D - 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but it's quite pushy|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 3N was made at the other table on board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: e/w can make 4 @h |pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Endplayed because of @d9 on the k.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3nt made on 12 in the other room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: good prediction Gabor|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h by s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Slam on a finesse. Opportunity for Gamax to take the lead|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: might end sadly|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt shows 5+@ss, unlimited.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south started with @HAK and another and declarer crossed to dummy and played a diamond to the @D8 in approved fashion :)|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like splintering with an ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 4 @c is @h support and short in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: me neither...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D some flavour of Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: showing a decent 4(+) card spade raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: E can't move i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, 3NT can be most anything over 3@S, so no way Winkler could move|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT a it on the heavy side|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit|pg||
nt|ady: better limit his hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass would do that well.|pg||
nt|viren169: although I cant think of an alternative bid?!?!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is quite interesting to play but should come to 11 tricks i should think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is wide-ranging over 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: that's what Ribeiro did|pg||
nt|athene: now all roads lead to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: same bidding in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 4@H is fine...|pg||
nt|athene: small spade lead is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Think will get a coffe ...|pg||
nt|athene: through the strong hands's fragment|pg||
nt|viren169: milk and sugar for me thks|pg||
nt|athene: hope for @SKJx in dummy (it's there) and @SQ with partner (unlucky)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzkc: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 22 is unusual|pg||
nt|ady: club r eturn best|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cicus: W did not have much choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but not unreasonable with passed pd|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mmmakela: best|pg||
nt|ady: cust from any spade trick|pg||
nt|ady: continue club|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: tough after 3@S|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have doubled but what t bid over 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: poor lead when holding most of the outstanding values!|pg||
nt|viren169: need to attack here...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @DK might make things a bit harder for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so this is a Morten's Fork coup|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|ady: still down 1    |pg||
nt|athene: it's just completely unnecessary as the @HA is right all along :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if 4NT is natural then (probably should be), you don't want to play there opposite nothing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: I would need more HCP for that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or would be if n had the @ha.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but this seems like a pretty dull 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: bingo|pg||
nt|viren169: redbl|pg||
nt|athene: probably 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: if west passed the double, then north might redouble yes|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||
nt|viren169: I think West will bid 2/3N|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oops, too slow.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cicus: interesting rebid, 2@D|pg||

nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||

nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: mayh go wrong|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||
nt|cicus: it all boils down to Gamax needing a big swing in the last board to save the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it is a swingy board|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: it will guess wrong due to the "s bid I think|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|athene: north has to drop the @CA (the card he is known to hold) so that west doesn't know he can ruff another club with impunity|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they are on different sides of the cortine|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your comments. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|athene: east has a solid double of 1@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: swingy hand indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is some decision at this point|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@C is easy as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North in the CR did the same|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt E-W here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well at the 3/4 mark it's till anyone's game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: E in CR bd 6@c over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jackpot|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no 20 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: (still)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: 3N or 4@S E/W way anyone?|pg||
nt|athene: now west will probably go 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: or, of course, 3nt :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||
nt|athene: most likely it will make four spades, two hearts, @CAK , @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||
nt|athene: well, @CA lead beat 4@S as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: given the SOTM|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3N...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||
nt|cicus: no only 11 tricks without giving up a diamond|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: most of the time there isn't much in it|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: pushy 4@S|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vugraphzkc: oops|pg||
nt|athene: but apart from only have 2-2 in his partner's suits, west's hand is actually quite suitable|pg||

nt|athene: even 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: or 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - 7NT isn't making i don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
