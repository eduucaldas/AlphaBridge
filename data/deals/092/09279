mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yuval10: the score isn't correct, of course Italy hasn't made 4@h on both sides in board 21|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the mini 2nt again|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 21 was flat at 4@h =|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: once again, 18-20 2NT|pg||
nt|le joker: yes misclik|pg||
nt|le joker: so it's 12-0 for france :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: brave effort with that outrageously bad club holding|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder what 3@c is|pg||
nt|me argent: red  card time|pg||
nt|yuval10: might be very dangerous for N if EW will decide to X|pg||
nt|le joker: majors i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: luckily his partner's club holding there to prevent him from disaster- admittedly two other suits to try in such a case|pg||
nt|yuval10: East will like it|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: i suggest he'll X quickly|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: neg double i assume|pg||
nt|yuval10: want to punish major or two perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: south doesn't seem to know the meaning of 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: or just point|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: which is fine since North had both...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and west has nothing better than to float it|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|yuval10: lol i wonder what does E thinks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead of course correct lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: now south asks and north tells him 3@c was for the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: so south is very scared and thinks he has shown more clubs|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, when you have most of the points in the board it's essential to lead trump|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well just as well south didnt understand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, nice lead, but no entry back for another trump through|pg||
nt|yuval10: lucky he didn't....3@h is down more, i believe|pg||
nt|lestergold: west can eitehr sacrifice a trump and draw them or play anything else|pg||
nt|le joker: the matter is if EW make 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason for them to buid 3N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, they should be able to make 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pick up all the dims|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Maybe they do, but North is in 2@H in the other room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|le joker: 5@c or 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: are you an opener in N ?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|othered1: 5@C is a very decent spot|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: East will probably overcall @ss and NS will discover they have no @s stop and will wind up in 5@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: Bessis do|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would open it...|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|le joker: 3@s  x -4|pg||

mb|p|nt|le joker: down 3|pg||
nt|othered1: I  wouldn't open it, then might have to deal with a 2@S opening from east|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: only -3|pg||
nt|othered1: And a lucky -3 a that|pg||
nt|le joker: x is take out|pg||
nt|lestergold: why bid a non vul game when you have a nice and easy defence against the oppos barrage west a few playing tricks short of his contribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: with a q which may not be working a doubleton and a working yarborough|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true, at IMPs it seems safest to pass and live with a +300|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or in this case: +500|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and lucky that the qd will take a slwo trick|pg||
nt|le joker: i disagree the bid of 3Â§S|pg||
nt|le joker: 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: North my infer that south does not have 5@H, as with the strength to bid over 3@S, he would have bid 2@H originally.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: true, however it would seem best to show the 3 card support|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: often 4@H is the best contract|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|le joker: exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hands like west- my main concern is not to aert the opps that we have a big spade fit too weak to fight best to keep quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjx: bidding 4@h does not show 3 cards, could be 4 as well since north couldn't bid hearts on a lower level|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: now if one of opps had three small spades he would be ably to identify his partners spade shortness  and slam easier to bid|pg||

nt|le joker: i agree :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yuval10: surely X now from East|pg||
mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: Bessis taking advantage of the vulnerability here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difference of style. North passed in the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: what's wrong in 3@c i wonder|pg||
nt|lestergold: but very hard to float when you have no trumop tricks and a known big fit n/s didnt know that e/w were so duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: i like 4@Cs|pg||
nt|le joker: here, they will play 4@s i think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in other words very difficult to know that 3s was going three light|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is off 1 on the @c lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: 4s looks slightly precarious altho 10 tricks made in closed|pg||
nt|lestergold: off to agood start for defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: still plenty of time for def. to switch|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: still another chance to switch here|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long as defence find a club switch when next in|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: a diamond was lead from the ace in the other room, and no club switch after south got the lead with the K of spaden|pg||
nt|le joker: South has to play K of @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: now declarer could pitch the club on the diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So East opened 1NT in the other room. However, according to the K&R Hand Evaluator the hand is worth 17.7|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, but as Roland said, North on the other room havn't bid @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not in fact at all healthy looking as a contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: on a bad day it loses a spade club heart and 2 dims|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Axx+Axxx+KQxx+A10    a hand a little too good for 1NT|pg||

nt|le joker: K of @s was better|pg||
nt|othered1: now @D to 10 will bring this home.  Maybe south thought north likely to have 8 @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south has a chance if he plays dim now south has to duck to give him a guess on the next round|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @d to the 10 will make this now|pg||
