nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||

mb|3C|an|3+ !c|nt|viren169: give N/S a problem to solve...|pg||

nt|jallerton: You don't get any useful count on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 7@H reached on board 14 in the open room for a flat board|pg||

nt|alpagavp: 1@h c est texas|pg||
nt|daman: 2-way   sorry|pg||
nt|chthonic: which would not help anyway.  just a spade guess|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 5@c would be interesting, 2 or 3 down on heart lead, but on a more likely D lead it might be let out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: water's arrived (eventually) but no glasses, grr|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: another @S only 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I have many time, thats is my profit margin|pg||
nt|chthonic: well, yes, actually, those would help, because there is one spade pitch on a heart, and another would ensure thirteen tricks.  But not there|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: we're recycling this morning's glasses|pg||
nt|jallerton: North doesn't seem to know about @sA, so grand not really on the picture|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2@D would likely have been passed out if he had passed |pg||
nt|viren169: now N/S may get spades back into it.|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully Lavery won't "gild the lily" by bidding game|pg||
nt|jallerton: very tempting to do so though|pg||
nt|daman: I don't agree|pg||
nt|daman: count his losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I really do think North should have bid 3@D after 2@C  --he was worth it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: Low diamond will be led now|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Eamon Galligan from Ireland|pg||

pc|cA|nt|garnetts: To make this South needs to play on spades early |pg||
nt|garnetts: Like now after the A@H |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D was a bit passive... but they have reached game with the aid of West.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: well they are very small I suppose|pg||

nt|bobholl: right you are and alternatives don't look good|pg||

nt|garnetts: In isolation two finesses--but not this time --entries won't allow it |pg||
nt|viren169: still not out of the woods yet...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bets line is cask K@S A@C ruff one ruff a spades  then a club over ruff--with K@D restricted choice to drop the queen |pg||
pc|h6|nt|golfsquash: Declarer is still in control|pg||
nt|bobholl: calculated risk for game|pg||
nt|daman: cannot possibly get coverage given partner didn't bid 3@C over 2@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: with spades|pg||
nt|golfsquash: a spade before the trump?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No Board 18 shows result as -1, whereas it should be -5, John's estimate is correct|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to set up the clubs... but 2@H bid makes it likely that West has long clubs.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--but the main issue here will be edropping the stiff q@D--which after the over ruff with the K@D should happen|pg||
nt|viren169: I think it is right to cash A@D|pg||

nt|garnetts: East would over ruff and play his last @D on that line|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|golfsquash: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|eamongall: Pat Walshe has been drafted in to play for CBAI as 3 of the original team are unavailable |pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: anyone for opening S's hand 1@H?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will E bal w 2 spades?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: kisses sry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: why not?|pg||
nt|me argent: 2 3 or 4@SS?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I like 4 but he may be worried that the double is a single suiter diamoinds and good hand maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: gotta get to game at least, so anything short of 4 doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: May also be worried about slam knowing short hearts opposite|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: We are all wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 @H or 2@H with the east hand ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robinswr: 1heart|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt will make here but not a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: A semi-normal 2@h opening.  |pg||

nt|me argent: ???|pg||
nt|othered1: That's "game at least," isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 5c also makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: why not|pg||
nt|chick: good disciplined pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 tricks in hand, no defense.|pg||
nt|robinswr: carruthers should underbid since weinstein is short in hearts and would double with maybe an 8-count |pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@S makeable I think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: (of defence)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but 5d is dangerous|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why weinstein bid 4diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: maybe even 4@S on a non @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - EW needs to get @H ruff to set 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: can't imagine N bidding anything|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|me argent: 2 fancy by far|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well if patner has a little extra 6@C could be on... if|pg||
nt|robinswr: this will be a hard contract to play since he has to get rid of his two heart losers|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south has @Ca instead of @Ha foe eg|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sunsamvar: for eg|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he will play to ruff @H in dummy..|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: trying 2 h ruff is dangerous|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Mesbur declares "now there's a surprise"  :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: yes I agree 3@C is looking for a swing type of action|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think west has a problem--I would pass personally--a bid which seems to have lost it value these days|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem for west is that he is bidding 3@S on a balanced hand when partner has passed--can that be right?|pg||

nt|chthonic: taking unusual positions.|pg||
nt|daman: EBU will gain 1 or 2 IMPs on this one   depending|pg||

pc|d6|nt|me argent: south just likes bidding more david|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4@S is a slim if any hope|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|othered1: woinder if 3@S is weaker than pass, since west has shown 4@S with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||

nt|garnetts: I note on Board 4 that East found the defence to beat 3NT--Dec misguessed--the club blockage meant only one down |pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: Anderson alerted 2C, don't know why|pg||
nt|viren169: could get into all sorts of problems now...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I  wouldn't play them--because it gives the oppo an extra string to their bow--you can bid the transfer suit for takeout and use dble to show a balanced hand--1NT a trick source--|pg||
nt|viren169: what about the advantages of using it... a lot of top players are using it now.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Serves NS right for not knowing their system--and you could argue that North has no reqason to bid 3@C--maybe 3@S |pg||
nt|viren169: best for North to pass before the red cards start appearing.|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view North must assume that South has a decent hand--in light of the pass with reasonable spades|pg||

nt|viren169: Game in spades is still unlikley opposite a decent hand, as South had passed 1@C.|pg||

nt|viren169: South was probably unsure about the 2@C in the 1st place...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see some advantages to the method of transfer responses--this has been tried many tiimes in the past--but I still think smart oppo gain more by it|pg||
