nt|mugsmate: Many pairs have 2NT available as minors over 1S. Perhaps this pair play a different method.|pg||
nt|capercliff: a good result in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: and e/w wil ldo well to flatten it|pg||
nt|sheepman: some also play it as weak or strong only, that agreement would stop them bidding 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|capercliff: many would open the E hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and in closed room did which made it a little easier to reach thye4h game which can make on the very friendly lie of the heart suit etc|pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: 3n is down 1|pg||
nt|mugsmate: That agreement (weak or strong) is all very well if the opponents bid slowly. But if game comes back to you and you hold the mid range hand you have an impossible guess.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mugsmate: OK - he's decided to reverse. Solves that problem.|pg||

nt|capercliff: natural systems it seems, go figure|pg||

nt|mugsmate: 8 on top - and a ninth will emerge as the defense open something up.|pg||
nt|sheepman: he has 8 top tricks, and the opponents can't set themselves up more than 2 without giving him a 9th, so this shouldn't present too much of a problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably on the opening lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: A@d and run the 10? after a @h lead I presume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this a reverse for all of you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It isn't for me|pg||
nt|capercliff: does he have a choice Roland?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well he will be put off a heart lead which of course gives a trick in any case|pg||
nt|mugsmate: I think so - A109x/A109 and supported clubs justify it in spite of the shortage in partner's suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: i dont like reversing with only 15 with a sinmgleton in pard's response it is an excellent 15 i agree but the revers a shade light|pg||
