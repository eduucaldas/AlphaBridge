pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play a kind of Cappelletti with 2@c and 2@d reversed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Laurant had alerted for @S+m, but Harings had not :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he forgot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: There was some confusion as to whether they played it over a weak NT as well or not|pg||
nt|april7: I think with singleton @D E 's hand to strong for 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh, i see|pg||
nt|hedyg: E has no cuebid at his disposal, could try a splinter, but that would show 4 cards in @s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and what do you do when pd bids 2@C?|pg||
