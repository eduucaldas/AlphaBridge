nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are John Comyn, Avram Kreisberger, Hans Werge and Ralf Willquist|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: this time a bad partial contract in @H for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Here South needs a @D-ruff in dummy to make 4 @S - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need help here,  these are 4 players I do not know |pg||
nt|raidouille: French style :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: goulash hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will play 3NT probably|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I would hate to play in 1H with this lot|pg||
nt|copeyj: bjr a tous|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Salut Simon|pg||
nt|jujux: Combien la France a t elle marqué au Round 9 romain ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Aha thanks :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N here showing both minors|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi David, Rob, folks.|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|col3435: I'll have to check that ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello again all |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: loos like 3NT here|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hi eveyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=61|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make you wince|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: precision 1@C and maximum negative |pg||
nt|yuval10: already starting with a bang, 6@h can be made here|pg||
nt|yuval10: with a restricted choice in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi again|pg||
nt|jujux: Salut Simon|pg||
nt|voldenuit: salut :) |pg||
nt|copeyj: Operator - you have missed North's original pass|pg||
nt|werge: Cela chute - 4 @H en Sud|pg||
nt|mariner1: E did not open 1@D I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all to more white house exploits|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5@c or even 6@c|pg||
nt|april7: they play precision?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2NT is 7+ without ace |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is a rather good slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but now no chance of getting there  S certainly did not stint on his pre-empt|pg||
nt|bobholl: can is the rigth word|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We're starting from scratch, no worries|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my, either we missed a pass or we're running into some Highly Unusual Methods here.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator I think you missed a pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting board to start with....|pg||
nt|mmmakela: these cards look more like it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like a fencing match - your move|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all. let's hope we will have a nice match.|pg||
nt|ady: no names of players|pg||
nt|copeyj: Salut Julien, Hans, Aymeric :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: et bjr à Romain|pg||
nt|voldenuit: ils se sont trompés à 90°|pg||
nt|jujux: operator, i think u probably missed a pass :)|pg||
nt|arthurking: Bonjour tout le monde|pg||
nt|copeyj: oui|pg||
nt|jujux: Oh romain @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: bjr Romain|pg||
nt|voldenuit: salut romain :) |pg||
nt|werge: Undo svp|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C = 300 c'est pas mal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well takes all sorts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzjy: yes they do|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S may land too high here.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad idea - South must be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes but it would be in a regular hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H 4C then what?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely worth it after 1@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c denies @s control, so 4@d = i have @d and @s control, otherwise i bid 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: Then play a big club or other system that has a non-game forcing forcing opening|pg||
nt|werge: OH - West is close to maximum...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a rather good 4 @S here |pg||
nt|ady: this should be h eld to around 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: is that better?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is round 17 out of 23|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, folks.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hey joe|pg||
nt|april7: So EW play mini NT not vul.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 7-bagger major sigh|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good raise with nice controls|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|werge: But on a @D-lead, you go down, Best play must be taking the Ace, then @C Ace - and 3 riounds of @H...?!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yesterday you told about a very conventional system. I think this pair is NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes it is|pg||
nt|werge: - but not this time...|pg||
nt|werge: North mus be declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one can only conclude from the French methods--2D is a GF while 2C is not quite GF--that the French bridge players get about twice as many rock-crusher hands as the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you can also make 6nt on W, but 6@h will go down on a @d lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so u have a singleton but it is an A so...|pg||
nt|werge: 500 - nice start...|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks as 4@s is the only game EW can make, considering the @c ruff that NS will get|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: "walk the dog" hand it seems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E not max for her opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: -did I say that?|pg||
nt|werge: For me, 3 NT is a normal bid with the East-hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N not interest in slam since knows missing 2 aces but|pg||
nt|cindy: so does S think N has a balanced hand ?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 4NT with north hand which for me wld be to play |pg||
nt|raidouille: agree with you aymeric|pg||
nt|jcomyn: roland where do we get results - cant find them on Google|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, all academic now|pg||
nt|bobholl: without a @S lead you can misguess @H but they won't misfguess|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wouldn't dream of opening 2NT - distorts your hand and makes it far too likely you will miss a slam in one of your suits.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi all, btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|col3435: I think this pair played, but we certainly don't have the full team here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: France is 4th and Netherlands blue 8th|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fairly straightfoward hand to start us off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Israel U25 is leading the event currently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would classically show pretty much what North has got, so South can go to the three level with a nine-card fit |pg||
nt|baldfriede: But pulled in the reins just in time.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North has no real reason to go on, so they have judges well|pg||
nt|werge: But best lead is 7 ot 8! of @D|pg||
nt|werge: or 8|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt is forcing now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: so in this "natural system", on strong hands nobody starts bidding naturally until the 4-level ....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes what's the hurry?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ends one way or the other in 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, thanks.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT makes also|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW never got dias mentioned|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek came close this year in the dutch "meesterklasse", loosing in the semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and he won the meesterklasse pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is impressive for U25 |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|othered1: True, but when my partner opens 2N and I hold xx, Kx, xxxxxx, xxx, I don't want to have to allow for a playable grand slam.  North's hand is just too good for suit play to get ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right into balanced hand structure|pg||
nt|mariner1: continued @H best defense|pg||
nt|santyclz: This gives him a chance to take the failing @d finesse.|pg||
nt|ady: diamond fall well   but hard to keep control of trumps after that|pg||
nt|yuval10: *4@h , that was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 2@h from S! even if 1nt is superweak|pg||
nt|davidb: based on no points in H -good eveluation!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why not make life difficult for ew|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: may be 2@H wasn't MF (1@H relay)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: For up to date results and pictures: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63|pg||
nt|marlowepi: les spectateurs francophones sont invites a poser leurs questions ou commentaires en francais s'ils veulent|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: South must shift to @H, when he gets the @C Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff a @D in his hand you mean|pg||
nt|tomi2: west has really 7 spades? thought this is a junior tournament :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that our best spot?|pg||
nt|raidouille: wow|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claire has passed she isn't sure if 4@d is trans |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i'm guessing as 2@H would be a neg 2N shows a @H positive|pg||
nt|cindy: no but it makes|pg||
nt|voldenuit: but fortunately @h are 2/2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: just need to untangle it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: which makes me wonder why norht didnt support earlier|pg||
nt|raidouille: 2NT is positive without aces and balanced|pg||
nt|cindy: 4D must have been a transfer   why would N pass 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: system notes won't become a best-seller on the basis of this auction|pg||
nt|werge: The most polite I can be to Norths bidding is to say: I do´nt know their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Sandie :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: give operator a moment,  we will get the names up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: arent the names up yet? sorry for the problems we uploaded wrong boards.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now mysterious|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok but 3@H will go down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A nice 4@s on 15 to 5 P|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: Now he is home, clubs are behaving well|pg||
nt|chick: dangerous play by W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or @DJ!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am sure operator will give them as soon as he has a moment.|pg||
nt|voldenuit: on a @s lead it's down |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he should ruff a @D as odds are the 1N opener has A@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can  only guess that s didn't have a weak 2 in @ds available.|pg||
nt|sybarra: names are not up to us,  need to click and display to us |pg||
nt|ahalim: wonder where this will end ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: i dare to predict they will reach 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And I dare to predict, that West might lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a contract you wouldn't expect in a junior tournament|pg||
nt|ady: finesses laying well   clubs 3-3  so defenders cannot take more than 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but timing is important here.|pg||
nt|gips: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: P;ushy, but making 3N to start out.  Actually figures to make 4 if west takes the @S finesse|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|werge: South could have half a million @s´s|pg||
nt|copeyj: Must be gazzili style with 1@S being kaplan inversion (0-4@S)?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easy start|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an unusal lead given the auction |pg||
nt|meikever: Results after round 14, and everything else you want to know: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Makes sense if 2@C artificial (whether 1@S was natural or forcing NT replacement), then 3@D would show very good red  hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63   for results and standing. After round 23 later today the first four qualify for the semi-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: but could go down on @H swich after @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on now - is, that they are telling E/W what they have...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know what they told..  cant read what North wrote down..|pg||
nt|bobholl: now show your own misbidding :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy theres an aggressive start|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: the @C jack is onside here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: cue for what? spades?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|werge: 8 tricks, I regret|pg||
nt|ady: now hearts best|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi John,    and yes here we go!|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit pesky that trumps are 3/1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonbt bid s if S bids em first|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|werge: If South bids a so-called Viod-wood, West might find the lead!|pg||
nt|werge: Void-wood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think North is relaying|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but a friendly one-level contract is fair for warm-up in this event|pg||
nt|werge: But North mighy ytak 11 easy tricks - loosing the 2 @H-tricks only|pg||
nt|werge: might take|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: these hands are one of the problems with strong nt|pg||
nt|arthurking: On a fait 16 contre la republique Che. , une bonne euipe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi joe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 9 tricks if W plays on @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: I would discard the @S 9 here|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|werge: Best card from South next seems to e te @H 7|pg||
nt|werge: be the|pg||
nt|april7: each @H is ok|pg||
nt|werge: With transfers yes - but the transfer occured too late...|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find q of @S doesnt he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can cross the hand out now |pg||
nt|werge: No he can cross-ruff, when he discards a @C from the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again on perhaps being forced to play the @S right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are perhaps slightly fortunate that any heart ruff comes with the ace of trumps |pg||
nt|baldfriede: One can hardly blame East for leading @s though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are cracking me up Marshall.....|pg||
nt|voldenuit: she has to play @h now |pg||
nt|sybarra: best the Q?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aymeric's "nom de clavier" is the title of a fine novella by Antoine de St. Exupery|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but with D there should be enough|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi again|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: will do the trick it seems|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is getting out of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: We don't have the correct card layout loaded|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S might've seen enough|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gips: it looks like the light opening bid of aldo paparo let a very good score, even if a little bit lucky, for italians|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like EW plays Upside-down count|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hey john|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: 2 means can stand return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best percentage play is one of two finesses but with 2-1 in @c he can have a discard so there is a choise with a @d lead|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a bit to do here, but things are friendly and 5 is possible, due to great @H pips|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: Yes, agreed.|pg||
nt|mariner1: many would Open N too|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Adam, Marshall.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: 7 rounds of bidding and only 5@c!|pg||
nt|voldenuit: :) well done claire :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has to be careful|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very |pg||
nt|santyclz: Off to a quiet start.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|werge: No - for sure a normal lead|pg||
nt|ady: can actually end play North for 12 tricks  unles he discard AKQ diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice try by East, but declarer didn't buy into it|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is only the heartfinesse remaining now...|pg||
nt|yuval10: Netherlands Red U-25 are currently 5th, and Norway 14th|pg||
nt|yuval10: Norway is only 10 VP's behind 4th place France, and the play in the final-four|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahalim: right, maybe they're not fully awake yet :)|pg||
nt|meikever: Results, bulletin, info and pictures on: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|mariner1: especially precision pairs with 2@C|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is a close rase for the final 4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Wd east to return a trump|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: natural club lead ruins this one|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: nice to hold the j of clubs if that @D had been held up |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if hts had been 2/1 would be down now |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2/2 rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the appearance of the J, suggests otherwise|pg||
nt|meikever: for the results, vugraph schedule, forum, pictures and all the info: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, if you didn't have the @cJ you'd better win the first trick with the @sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel leads with 264, then comes Italy 255, Sweden 254 and France U-25  251|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2: we have 6 rounds with 10 boards each today. we play a compleate round robin with 24 teams that is 23 rounds in the next 4 days|pg||
nt|ahalim: passive defence prevails here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: plenty of tricks now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why didn't N unblock the heart?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: well that made it easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's a nice surprise for North|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to hear this post mortem?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi John.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|voldenuit: @s ruff @d and a discard @h |pg||
nt|raidouille: @s ruff and @h discard on @d|pg||

pc|c3|nt|werge: They should have taken 5 runds - and bid 7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@C showed 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@H was rkc, and then it ended|pg||
nt|xenya: well this doesn't look too convincing to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: west thought long and hard about his bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: first 4 play semifinals and finals friday. so its a long trip|pg||
nt|jujux: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry players were a bit late i'll update the namen|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: slight problem, declarer didnt cash a 4th @D and played a heart that got ruffed|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may need to take a deep breath after that one (both teams)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh pooh|pg||

nt|ady: could only make 11 on the end play|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS make 4@H, could see some action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought age was 25 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6-what?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 hearts most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East doesn't appear to have many entries here either - and, looking at it, neither does West|pg||
nt|chick: I would have tried a heart lead on the last hand|pg||
nt|werge: I knew it would happen - now they will hardly find 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: pour les resultats et les infos|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C about limit here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry on the other team this is England u-20 only|pg||
nt|april7: another partial this time in @H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: sometimes a natural system is easier....|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like to play weak jumps even in 4th seat, so 2@S would have been my call but if you play standard methods 2@S is stronger. with reopening you sometimes make opps bid a game that ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: they would not find else, so I have sympathy for his pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what I bid with S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C might be wiser |pg||
nt|chick: doesn't work any better :)|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be the fashion to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an aul part-score 1NT probably|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know systems here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so very difficult to cope with|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like EW can make 6@D on very few hcp|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but that is just lucky|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes.... A@D onside and @d 2-2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never get there|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@S can make here, but missing the @S KQ probably won't be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: my guess is 2@s on NS|pg||
nt|santyclz: What do we know about the systems (other than e-w aren't using a big @c system?)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here someone could get pumped too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: NS card says "'SAYC'"|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes they are IMP makers|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: EW will do well to bid 5@D over NS's majors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Missing a chance here, unless South decides to chime in.|pg||
nt|arthurking: 4@s le contrat probable|pg||
nt|copeyj: oui|pg||
nt|ady: n/s limit 1@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Rob.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: even 5@d may be a bit of a challenge|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missing AQJ of trumps lol|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2N is probably an invitational+ hand with @S fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6nt available here (or 6@s).|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|othered1: west  has a flat hand with NT count, but unless 1@C isn't natural, why distort the hand when a siimple 1@S rebid is available?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think e/w got the big swing per operator|pg||
nt|raidouille: no drury ?|pg||
nt|werge: No,pls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sikora  with a   k|pg||
nt|ady: looks like you are right Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: east seems bemused by the redouble, i can see West's hand so i am rather bemused aswell|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL works here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any x with w opposite a passed pd?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and south has junk|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is off 500 actually|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5th vs 6th playing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Godd bidding, both tables play the jump for pre-emptive|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for it Raymondt!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say "vince")|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SjoerT Brink always calls him Vinnie|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  but I am not so familiar with him to do that |pg||
nt|sybarra: is N thinking of bidding?  I doubt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: He is|pg||
nt|werge: Another to the toilet? We fall asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North is thinking..|pg||
nt|werge: Thinking of whom?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: of 6@S?|pg||
nt|ahalim: The @S Jxx makes this a good 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this round all nations, who send 2 or more teams to this event play against each other, like this match, to avoid this pairings in the later rounds of the round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: must admit that 2@C would not be my rebid with souths hand. 3334 and some kind of semi stop in spades, thats a normal 1NT bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes then N has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|tomi2: north might now misjudge his hand and go for some club contract expecting partner to be more unballanced and have no help in spades|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello Cornelia.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Alexandre Kilani|pg||
nt|ahalim: the 4-1 division will be troublesome|pg||
nt|mmmakela: note no 2@C from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Good|pg||
nt|chick: Are we having fun yet? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are the boys concentrating on their cards Sandie|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT can be beaten double-dummy, but i suspect that defence will find it quite hard to do|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@s isn't a normal Precision rebid, is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Merci|pg||
nt|werge: Funny 4 @S here - missing the top of the family|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very surprsing pass b W|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is unmakeable|pg||
nt|april7: to aggressive, is this game forc.?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they play strong club so NF|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: good point Hans,  what was her name again?|pg||
nt|werge: He better only think of 5 @s|pg||
nt|werge: So they might bid a bad 7 @h now - and make it|pg||
nt|meikever: results from round 5: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course juniors didnt go to Holland to pass|pg||
nt|voldenuit: c'est sikora il me semble le nom d'est contre bessis volcker |pg||
nt|werge: Et 11 levées +/- une|pg||
nt|ady: sold for 200|pg||
nt|mariner1: well still the deadly 200|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is prbably ony 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: but 3@s can make|pg||
nt|le joker: hi all :)|pg||
nt|april7: doesn't look like, for me it would be|pg||
nt|werge: Now allready two boards, where my mother would´nt have understood the bidding...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W has that nice H 9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: strong club fo;;owed by a few natural bids would have worked out fine there i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like the 3 nt call, and now to beat this |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking back at the hand, i find it odd that E led a club from three small instead of the Q of spades--the latter seems automatic|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: passing 3@C would have shown a bette rhand than bidding 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi alex|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has a difficult decision as opener. Both 1D and 1NT have advantages and disadvantages. the hand is rather strong for 1NT with a good 5-card suit and so many aces, and also more ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oriented toward suit play, which argues for 1D. but 1NT could make it possible to reach a black-suit game that would otherwise be missed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: good guesser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 7 tricks with best defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes DBL of 1@H looks right to me with W......|pg||
nt|mariner1: carries some danger though with the Vul vs NV position|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but it´s worth bidding, @H Queen is deciding |pg||
nt|baardolav: and spade 2-2?|pg||
nt|werge: PK|pg||
nt|werge: OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah, i guess you X, and convert 3@h to 3@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hello alexandre|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Welc Alex :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no red-blooded junior will stay out of slam - whetreher it makes or not|pg||
nt|meikever: for results, ranking, info, pictures and bulletins: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: your son?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Juniors today are a *lot* more disciplined than when I was one.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another disadvantage of 1D is you are not well placed if partner responds 1S (unless you play a 2C rebid by opener is artificial and forcing, as in Kaplan-Sheinwold and other ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: methods)|pg||
nt|ahalim: and this goes down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: girls bid little too high again|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will anyone of you try 3@h on E?|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests 2@S bid took one cuebid away for north so he has to decide the final contract now, he will be surprised but not unhappy with this dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 2NT re-opening is enterprising|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt E/W will make here, since @s favourably and @c too and @h split 4-4.|pg||
nt|ady: t his will come home |pg||
nt|gips: i am quite agree on the 1nt opening, with Qx and Kx it looks like the best part|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how many boards in a match?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s, 5@c, declarer needs then @d finesse to the J|pg||
nt|yuval10: and north need to find the very unlikely switch of the A@h in order to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: but N can see the only chance is a of @H|pg||
nt|arthurking: sur entame K de @d|pg||
nt|arthurking: il ne faut pas manier les @s en securite sinon on fait 1@d 2 atouts et ...|pg||
nt|arthurking: DX de @c sont placéss mais|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bu then she is not a junior|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: a "non cue" |pg||
nt|sybarra: or help request?|pg||
nt|chick: it's not a good grand ... requires 3-3 hearts or the J to fall singleton|pg||
nt|raidouille: Indeed, a spec told me that 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@s = or +1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|werge: On a @C-lead, there would be many tricks in a @s-contract - if your intermediats were better|pg||
nt|ady: all the n/s soft cards worthless in a diamond contract|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: south is a very promising 16 year old junior|pg||
nt|werge: She never was|pg||
nt|ahalim: on the other hand the @D's are very friendly |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get carried away|pg||
nt|sybarra: seem to have found the brakes|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: action..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a very reasonable spade lead, holding so many diamonds. If E had the king of spades instead of the ace, this lead would gain a trick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|werge: 500 in your hand(s)|pg||
nt|xenya: not me Ralph|pg||
nt|werge: Sporty guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: or often called "last train"  (unusual at the 5 level) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think he wanted 6@S but was not sure..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North, ok back to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be "happy" to be in only 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra: is "back to 4 @S"  called a reverse??  (LOL)|pg||
nt|werge: reserve|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what if South gets an entry to dummy, he might take the @D hook?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am a bit surprised by 2@h. Certainly West's hand is worth more than that.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I just know that if I did it, the opponents would wake up, bid 4@H, and score 620|pg||
nt|chick: It was alerted, perhaps shows more than minimum|pg||
nt|werge: Jack to fall is no good = one down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or a good 7@d. Since all bids are alerted - who knows what they mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H, yes. But 7@D is excellent |pg||
nt|chick: yes, even that ... 3-3 hearts is necessary|pg||
nt|voldenuit: east has to overtake the queen of @c the 2nd trick |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and his dad is keeping an eye on you|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@D was probably an artificial game force|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hence 2NT is still forcing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wasn't used though|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: hmm not after this lead ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: a good spot, nevertheless|pg||
nt|werge: But yoy might make this by bringing in the @D-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 2@S is 5@S and side 5-bagger. 2N asks.  Makes sense|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should have braked at 3NT though|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S might have been easier, as well as 3 nt |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this a ropey contract again|pg||
nt|sybarra: just close your eyes |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hop is about to pay for his 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trust mr Bessis|pg||
nt|le joker: i play in the french :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: doubling Thomas is usually not a good idea|pg||
nt|le joker: team*|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that helps, club lead better|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Felix Zimmermann from Germany|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant figure 2S must be some system we dont know about|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 5-5 17-18 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: Very precise, as it turns out|pg||
nt|mariner1: except the @D :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: W will be happy to make 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Felix,  welcome |pg||
nt|400 volt: HI all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ill try and find out|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am being told it shows 8-11 with e-card support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Note that North has seen his partners' re-openings before |pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3-card support*|pg||
nt|chick: yes, a kib also tells me 8-11|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes 2@D was GF|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: oh well...see what happens when you lead pards suit?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@D is best I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure 3@H is right on that. Possibly transfer to hearts and then bid diamonds|pg||
nt|werge: You might fall even in 6 @H having a lay-down 7 @d|pg||
nt|chick: if you were in 7@H, how would you play the heart suit?|pg||
nt|gips: better to protect the sorter top honours|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now HA like a shot|pg||
nt|bobholl: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: cards on table, head in hands|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 8 if he ducks so still chance|pg||
nt|yuval10: when you don't know what to do after you win a trick, it might be better to duck it and let partner give you more information|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion S must play a low spade, so N can have a count.&1c, 3@s, 4@d anh singleton @h|pg||
nt|vincenzo: hi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Vincenzo.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E needs to switch to @d after he'll take the A@h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as N is about to find out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Landry Andrea|pg||
nt|raidouille: hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incorrectly|pg||
nt|werge: No J x x by East or J x x x by West - what´s best?|pg||
nt|gips: shorter|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Not my kind of opening, to be honest. I am a bit old fashioned about 1nt openings.|pg||
nt|yuval10: there's some danger here....what if West bid 3NT with 6 cards @c ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Worse than that, they prevent e-w from being able to make anything.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: how much is 5@DXX+1 hmm.. 850?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no... 1000|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: that makes more sense|pg||
nt|santyclz: Low @h to the J or 7?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Landry and (Chanson de) Roland|pg||
pc|c7|nt|werge: But all you need in 7 is trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: this will be over in a moment|pg||
nt|le joker: fast food ! :)|pg||
nt|april7: good break in @H and 9 tricks luckily|pg||
nt|werge: You might not need the good break in @H - if @d 10 is with the land @h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: ah well done|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: two without the queen|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: good :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: welldone|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|werge: Where are the loosers, when you ruff two @H´s in the East hand?|pg||
nt|werge: Winning libe is @S to dummy, @c-guess and @D-too |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: should sign off now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: 13 |pg||
nt|sybarra: now needs the @D cash and the ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: or club, @D, @D,  and sp |pg||
nt|gips: second reason, a bit more difficult for opps to bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: low club from North would be a tester|pg||
nt|chick: they should make this, so S's gamble didn't accomplish much|pg||
nt|meikever: results round 2 can be found on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has to switch to @d now.|pg||
nt|chick: nice looking playing site :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will be worried about a 5-1 diamond split |pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hi pard|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now defence cannot fail|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems to me given even a whiff of slam they are after it like greyhounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how I play from her  |pg||
nt|sybarra: duck this all around?|pg||
nt|yuval10: South don't know even about J@s, so it's quite a clear sign-off|pg||
nt|werge: long @H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: Luckily enough it´s difficult to bid 7 - West could have the "other" red king|pg||
nt|ahalim: what will W discard on the @C's ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Guiseppe in the North's seat is Vincenzo's son|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep your eyes closed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now -1, when not playing the 9 of @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: but down now on a club switch|pg||
nt|chick: S can see the diamond suit on the dummy, so he must attack clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But what other options did declarer have? He can't get rid of the @s losers and the @c loser anyway. I think trying the @d was his only chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to see how a club switch can cost here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, South does not know about K@H.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But if a @c lead is bad, is then the @d lead any better?|pg||
nt|othered1: South can make the low spot play, based on auction.  Tipping north to the @C card, perhaps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nope, going to prolong the agony.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baldfriede: This is not as easy as it looks at all. If @h are 5-1...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Indeed.|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
nt|baardolav: well defended|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a big disaster to get a plus score here for EW|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: He seems to be home, loosing 1 @S, 1! D and 1 @C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: L´impasse polonnais|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ciao Vincenzo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjy: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hello and welcome back :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We seem to have had some glitch; I am sure Roland will explain what happened soon.|pg||
nt|meikever: You can find all the information about the tournament on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - with pictures of the vugraph tables!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: very well judged! With no help from S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never happnes to me so I wouldnt know|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: This is his last chance...|pg||
nt|othered1: north knows the hand is making|pg||
nt|werge: If ruffed ny North, he must overtake and close his eyes for 2-2 in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: +420 NEXT!|pg||
nt|vincenzo: ciao Roland !|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Vincenzo|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: nicely arranged defense |pg||
nt|vincenzo: hi champions !|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though juniors generally sign contracts promising to bid whenever it is their turn, the 2H call by N was not well-advised with almost no values of any kind, even at this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vulnerability--in part because the call takes up no room, and also because it does not really serve a useful purpose|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe e didn't ruff the @s.|pg||
mc|6|nt|werge: Plays better than he bids - only one down|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should safety-play diamonds - king first|pg||
nt|werge: So he must start @d with the K|pg||

nt|werge: What a lucky 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough match,  only 1 imp the air so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you know any of the players Felix?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: all players in discussion, wish roland were here, I don't understand anything |pg||
nt|raidouille: 4@s in EW|pg||
nt|voldenuit: boring board |pg||
nt|ralfwil: with nothing more than @hQJ10 for -1|pg||
nt|othered1: More action, with the pressure on north's first bid, most likely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to know where this ends after w bids 4H|pg||
nt|copeyj: pas 13|pg||
nt|fokal: bjr a tous|pg||
nt|copeyj: bjr Oliv|pg||
nt|jujux: Salut Oliv|pg||
nt|arthurking: Slt man|pg||
nt|voldenuit: slt |pg||
nt|santyclz: I thought n would run 3 or 4 @ds before giving up.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: east did consider ducking the Q@S, if only for a moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: joey silver should have been here for this one |pg||
nt|yuval10: Sweden is 2nd place currently, with 290 VP's|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: the lucky @h position makes 3NT makeable here|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: might just go 1N-3N|pg||
nt|raidouille: welcome back :)|pg||
nt|raidouille: Contract here is 2@h by S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Having real connction problems today.  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, the tables were not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or connection for that matter.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but the operator must enter results manually for boards already played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I need board number, declarer and number of tricks and I will give the codes|pg||
nt|raidouille: oops|pg||
nt|raidouille: operator you switch side |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's OK now, he did it|pg||
nt|raidouille: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now a good spade game|pg||
nt|april7: 1@H by E and 1NT by S,then we will see|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|400 volt: No, sorry :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may just up and bid it |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a difficult lead, With a black lead 3@d is -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very,  qj of @H falling |pg||
nt|sybarra: its imp pairs,  sorry |pg||
nt|baldfriede: 11-13 1nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: The ambiguous 1@C opening makes north's decision more difficult|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Sa en EO|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT - best played by North|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 20-20 hand here|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel first with 310, France U-25 3rd with 287 and Italy 4th with 286|pg||
nt|werge: @S better thab @H here - even 10 tricks are easy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|400 volt: maybe by seeing, but not more :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 6@C if they can get there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks  a hectic hour ahead of us|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Good board here for those who smoke|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it imps agst. the field? |pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: S has difficult decision when playing polish |pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand for fit jumps.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s may not bid now|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2 or 3@d?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3|pg||
nt|werge: than|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahalim: Hi Shirl|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's a matter of who will beat who to 1NT|pg||
nt|le joker: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@S unfortuntely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they should avoid 3N, but that won't be to hard..|pg||
nt|bobholl: will reach 4@S via smolen perhaps ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything well placed so no obvious problem|pg||
nt|werge: Take the money - West is a junior|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H isn't automatically down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes easy enough here as W has no entry......... 4@S makes....... 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: E made a conservative pass|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: west had a difficult bid|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: pass, 2@C and 2@D all have drawbacks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Potential game swing to France on  21 as a spade lead and club shift defeats 4H|pg||
nt|werge: This looks more like 110|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS are playing 10-12, so the 9 is either right or all the same|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: hi Arifin:)  |pg||
nt|gips: for the same reason, my opening bid here was 1@S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was solved with a ! X|pg||
nt|fokal: salut romain alors un ptit commentaire en direct ... ?|pg||
nt|arthurking: V@s ?|pg||
nt|werge: Heureusement entame @S s´impose - pas @h|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  can make   will take some bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h suit is following them around|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 quick tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 140 is the limit|pg||
nt|cindy: what do they respond 1N with ?|pg||
nt|arthurking: ouais tres bonne ambiance :) tournoi toujours aussi sympatique|pg||
nt|fokal: comment ca se passe l'ambiance est bonne ?|pg||
nt|werge: Entame @C = 600|pg||
nt|arthurking: oui superbe ambiance il faut dire que pour l instant on gagne nos matchs...|pg||
nt|fokal: oui ca aide :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: belle moyenne 21 :) |pg||
nt|fokal: salut les autres !  L'ambiance de bbo est bonne ? ;)|pg||
nt|arthurking: tention a ne pas mettre la dame de @s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well claimed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E running to clubs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Thomas|pg||
nt|ady: a mis fit      4@S a possibility    but poor game|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding west's hand in length-order.  Some very respected players would open 1@S without second thought, especially with the suit qualilty disparities|pg||
nt|othered1: But that rebid would not occur to me.|pg||
nt|gips: 5 clubs one down only with trump lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Especially with two aces outside|pg||
nt|ady: even without a trump lead   still down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or 6nt for that matter 2154.|pg||
nt|santyclz: But for the @d break.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 6n :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, partner will reopen if you pass, but you are undestating your values somewhat|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I might have doubled with north if that's for takeout|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: with north's cards|pg||
nt|davidb: good  6Sp  -not easy  to reach. |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Often defenders take the @D Ace, three @s-tricks - and finish with the 13th @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: solved neatly otherwise 3nt unreachable|pg||
nt|othered1: But so are north and south :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: this could be a big swing board..........|pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of pairs on the other side of the pond use 2nt as an inv+ raise rather than the forcing raise usually used here.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this is no bargain|pg||
nt|sybarra: why do I think we go for it?|pg||
nt|werge: North´s very BIG 1 NT was saved at last|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but partner wasa passed hand so passing is also reasonable|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wonder if N created a forcing situaton for himself?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|werge: Here trick 11 comes from the weakest suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 8 tables..|pg||
nt|werge: I think they plays 12-14 - but counting the intermediates...|pg||
nt|ady: trumps not strong enough if a spade is ruffed|pg||
nt|gips: but not 4 spade..... because defense has no suits |pg||
nt|ady: this does have some chance    club lead can go down immediately|pg||
nt|jujux: Sur entame @s le contrat est un peu plus tendu, le declarant va devoir être précautieux|pg||
nt|ady: might get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: should squeak home but not easy |pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match now available on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=67&Itemid=57 (pictures round 15)|pg||
nt|baardolav: standard 1NT 6-11|pg||
nt|werge: Thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: must play for spades 3-3    then set about clubs|pg||
nt|gips: the only chance|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I prefer 1NT than 2@d |pg||
nt|werge: Roi de @C|pg||
nt|werge: @H|pg||
nt|jujux: j'ai oublié quelques "n" mais vous m'avez compris|pg||
nt|arthurking: selon GIB le declarant devait prendre de las a la premiere levée pour gagner|pg||
nt|arthurking: Concernant le tournoi c'est assez intense , on a 6 match de 10 donnes par jours|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will finesse @d probably after cashing A@d , just in case W has a singel Q|pg||
nt|jcomyn: matter of curiosity what would xx be by N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Dave Thompson from Australia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: meaning could S be strong now?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4 @S was not the contract I expected :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: same here|pg||
nt|othered1: The defense isn't automatic here, too|pg||
nt|le joker: sorry bad connexion in amsterdam, many computers !|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: and ofcourse also 6 @H and 6  NT|pg||
nt|april7: doubleton K of @D|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 6 NT on at @c-lead - South is squeezed I´m sure, when West takes the 6th @H!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: scores at:  http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi|pg||
nt|werge: Can make witout @s-shift and @d-ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: EW may need to take the first 3 tricks, if declarer guesses the hand correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Youval Yener|pg||
nt|mrdct: hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this would be ok if spades weren't 5-1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt 6D a good spot|pg||
nt|meikever: Pictures of this match now available at http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - round 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: This will make since @D 3-3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: My lead is @c10 from that suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: e/w will have to open the @D suit in time, @ST is dropping... ok not anymore|pg||
nt|chick: You can find all the information about the tournament on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - with pictures of the vugraph tables!|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it systemic?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: what would bid after 1nt with East hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they play strng+5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 nt also but I play 2/1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well you worry they may endup in wrong spot now too|pg||
nt|ady: if he gets Q@S lead must win with the king   needs the ace entry to get 2nd diamond ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: +680, you know the rest.|pg||
nt|mariner1: you just can't afford to pass with E here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yuval|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi Yuval |pg||
nt|yuval10: hey Roland, hello all|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|werge: Without the @H 10, South should be declarer|pg||
nt|raidouille: As expected, 3NT went down on board 22 so this is a big swing for France|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might bid slam but need to find @S Q|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Dave|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standing with 2 matches to go: 1. Israel U25 421 VPs - 2. Sweden 385 - 3. France U25 377 - 4. Italy 374 - 5. Poland U25 371 - 6. Netherlands Red U25 348. First four qualify for the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: semi-finals tomorrow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: It seems to be the plys called - I just take my tricks|pg||
nt|werge: play called|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead will also help|pg||
nt|ady: club lead from K(6 most unlikely|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: as opposed to british acol, fmous for light 2/1's|pg||
nt|cindy: W is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1 nt even in 2/1 is semi forcing I suppose |pg||
nt|ahalim: we all would make 6 seeing all the cards :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: with KX@D  East worth a go|pg||
nt|ahalim: and now a @C back|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be in tempo duck |pg||
nt|sybarra: and John is here also |pg||
nt|yuval10: tendency for penalty|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not the hand I would xx|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think N want to play 1M X , hench 1NT is ok|pg||
nt|werge: RD works best, especially IF 1 NT is 6-11...?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but then can bid 1NT to show top of nt range|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Unfortunately the T98@C are in declarer's hand, which means that this should be either Making or -1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: need to get the @C suit goin I think |pg||
nt|tomi2: he could overtake the @H, esp. after @H9 was played by west|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is a passed hand and has a very nice doubleton in opener's suit ans some controls and a decent (thought short) D suit. I like 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont think most play it forcing at all by a passed hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: the "normal" lead will dispose on @D perhaps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was refering to girls bidding high on 2 previous boards, now they stayed in a sure spot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: But South will lead the @H 10!|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room did bid 4@H on 5 -- bound to bring them lots of points |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: This is a imp pairs (butler) So the score on the left is not important|pg||
nt|400 volt: I think I would have stayed in 1 NT with me :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be very trick to make if he can |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good poker hand - four nines|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has an entry!|pg||
nt|fokal: on dirait qu'il va chuter|pg||
nt|fokal: le flanc faisant 2 @s 1 @h et 2 @d|pg||
nt|arthurking: humm ze crois bien|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: it costs only 3 imps|pg||
nt|april7: so whats the loss?|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that was better|pg||
nt|ady: assume 4 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Yuval - youve missed all the excitement but I feel there is more to come|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see North find the "killing" shift - @S Q...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tomi2: and then play spade towards dummy, then he can make 3 spade tricks |pg||
nt|werge: But OK - it´s their system|pg||
pc|d3|nt|400 volt: @D q was misclick?|pg||
nt|ady: K96|pg||
nt|ady: east looking for Q@C   for a grand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobholl: K of @S migth lead to 1 down more|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth have lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cQ! will create an extra trick!|pg||
nt|bobholl: n ot if she dumps a@S|pg||
nt|werge: With better trumps, you might play East for the Queen|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice auction|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: i've seen the 6@h board|pg||
nt|sybarra: thix tale, exp. S  shows not fear |pg||
nt|baardolav: making only 600 now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: this may be a swing|pg||
nt|werge: Mais attention - les polonnais savent se battre aavec les @C|pg||
nt|voldenuit: lol|pg||
nt|fokal: oui mais la ils ne sont pas 3-3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fortunate that the @d ruff comes in the long trump hand.|pg||
nt|ady: can draw 2 trumps first|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i predict there may be some time between dummy coming down and a card being played|pg||
nt|ady: must win the likely spade lead in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H hook works too though it is not needed|pg||
nt|col3435: west's heart pitch is making declarer's @h7 look quite big|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: could be a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the @h was a misclick :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: :-)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Does someone know if there's a official site for this event? |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes one sec |pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sK had been right, but @cQ will make the same reault. If discarding a @s another @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: now has to guess the @Ds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another club gives 2 @d tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 is rigth Q is wrong :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does not matter @dJ is a trick|pg||
nt|ady: quuen of spades seems normal|pg||
nt|ady: king|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can make even taking @SA however K@S now is easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: can also make via 3@H's, AK AK AK 2 @H ruffs and the 4th @C in dummy, tho may require careful handling|pg||
nt|sybarra: *table |pg||
pc|c5|nt|mtvesuvius: 3 minor suit losers now, making 2|pg||
nt|le joker: making now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if Bessis tries to ruff out a @d however it will be down, because of the @c spots|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tomi2: now they cut off his communication to the spades, he cant use them anymore because he lost the tempo in trick 1|pg||
nt|gips: not finished yet|pg||
nt|othered1: Still a matter of getting the @SJ right|pg||
nt|yuval10: which going to give many imps to Israel as they're playing a hopeless 7 next door|pg||
nt|sybarra: we thought they were pushing it to be in 6 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: south opens 1@h in the OR, unlike here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then we had the EXCITING bd 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12 rather |pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry didn't visualize the club situation|pg||
nt|davidb: declarer has communication problems -not sure to make|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: Still may have to guess @H|pg||
nt|gips: e must guess the heart|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 2@d the @s aren't enough beautiful to bid 3@s and a little too beautiful for 2@s |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice discard!|pg||
nt|bobholl: true and with no @C guess is essential|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just suggested we close our eyes and look at result |pg||
pc|c4|nt|meikever: pictures from this match now available at: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|baldfriede: No longer.|pg||
nt|ahalim: NEXT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: not nenough entries|pg||
nt|werge: Il répete la double impasse á @C|pg||
nt|arthurking: Aie|pg||
nt|arthurking: Fred peut etre remis en main now|pg||
nt|fokal: il fallait en faire une juste apres la dame de @s pour des raison de communications|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could be a nil-all draw weith these hands|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was the killing lead, spade ace-spade works too this time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: claim is coming up |pg||
nt|werge: But 8-card-suit left helps you to guess @s|pg||
nt|othered1: south has a pretty good inferential count on the hand.|pg||
nt|meikever: See http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for results, articles and vugraph schedule|pg||
nt|fokal: ce qui n'est pas du tout raisonnable car il faut tester les @d avant|pg||
nt|sybarra: if @H8 comes thru now it will be a huge card|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 14 imps to Israel in the first one|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c now|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think they just let him make it.|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to start a tap on dmy.|pg||
nt|raidouille: any return taken or ruffed in dummy, A@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's hard when defending to realize declarer is on a 3 card suit.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When @d are 3-3, there are no problems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but after a @d discard???|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that made no sense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: north with @HK would know from previous trick that declarer had singleton|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed but why not throw useless Diamonds|pg||
nt|davidb: delarer could not believe D 3-3 after the lead..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|meikever: for info and photos: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why keep Clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 7@s in hand is another key card|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: close eyes and hope for sp splite|pg||
nt|sybarra: *split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience, half-measure compromises like 2D create more problems than they solve. in general, i think it is better to bid 2S and hope you get another chance. after all, pd ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did make a 2/1 and so he is very likely to bid again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my last comment i was referring to  a 2D rebid by opener|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: @C4 was now a lavinthal discard showing values in @D|pg||
nt|meikever: All information of the tournament is available on httm://www.jeugdbridge.nl/ there are now pictures of the vugraph tables on|pg||
nt|meikever: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|tomi2: fisher takes a lot of time, he does not want to make a mistake. but he must be carefull, in my experience most TD's give time penalties for slowplay in the first round(s) and later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: not, to show all players that they care for the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: thx Meike|pg||
pc|c9|nt|april7: washout only 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: so 6 @H should have been made in other room|pg||
nt|werge: Should we say it this way: It seems, that 6 @H might have won in the other room...|pg||
nt|april7: if you pull trump and play on @S you must play Ace of @D and @D and you make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|arthurking: ouf|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is a hand of spot cards|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now the last @S will sequueze north|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: previously i was approving the 2D response. in fact i like this auction all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: went too fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant quite get to 10 tricks here I think |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|400 volt: tx shirley|pg||
nt|ady: duck the next club   will beat it|pg||
nt|othered1: still needs @S guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, making 3|pg||

nt|yuval10: perfect timing|pg||

nt|raidouille: claim|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: E/W must have run foul of a director when claiming once|pg||
pc|h6|nt|col3435: well, that was touch and go. If the defence had been more passive I wouldn't have fancied declarer's chances.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|april7: Q of @S:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South starts asking now|pg||
nt|april7: what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what west showed 2N and 3@D were relays it seems|pg||
nt|werge: He asks, what his partner has left...|pg||

nt|werge: @Slam"...|pg||
nt|400 volt: expensive one|pg||
nt|werge: When N overcalls 1 NT it will be expensive...|pg||
nt|othered1: That's quite a nice result for EW|pg||
nt|gips: no, 2 @H, 3@D, 1C and 4@S|pg||
nt|gips: 10 tricks even ducking the club|pg||
nt|ady: had to try the low heart to test west|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have nort done that good (1st lead @S Q in case J bare|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1100 is alot when you have these @D and @CK|pg||
nt|othered1: but declarer obviously got it right.  Turns out maybe the preempt helped NS|pg||
nt|col3435: because those last two tricks weren't entirely neccesary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes. he just asked W how many hearts he had and was told 3 but he had pitched one|pg||
nt|yuval10: North pushed a bit with 7 point but i think it's justified|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah a little unlucky|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: what happened to my typing skills I wonder|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That should be +1 I think...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no just he said|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol NS aren't known for their slow play, to say the least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an easy 5C|pg||
nt|raidouille: 5@c here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He had an entry on @s8 to discard @cQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this wont change things|pg||
nt|davidb: interesting board . N did not found his way -not easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Slam???|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to get there |pg||
nt|sybarra: @C or nt?|pg||
nt|werge: - and guess the trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: another 4@H NS...........|pg||
nt|yuval10: vulnerable, good sports, working points...|pg||
nt|yuval10: *spots :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont mind being in 4 in that hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: will south or north X here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and where so you want to play it? |pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like another 3NT |pg||
nt|werge: Another quiet game coming up|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much action so far|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bring back Israel!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: comparing to the excitement of last match, that is|pg||
nt|yuval10: first board produced 7 imps for the Dutch|pg||
nt|april7: S wil end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: ok no X|pg||
nt|400 volt: if the other table stays in 1 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes as long as they dont get carried too high|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, a hugh result for England|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score special here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in 4Hx|pg||
mb|2D|nt|werge: 1 NT seems to be 3 down og a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: on a |pg||
nt|april7: another 6@S and 7 without a @H lead|pg||
nt|april7: sorry only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% slam, 12 tricks with @sK on side|pg||
nt|werge: A slam here - and E/W will have a giant-score|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess the clubs in either game |pg||
nt|ady: yes one K@H was played|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@c semi forcing 2@d 2Nt |pg||
nt|jcomyn: by the way folks Dutch girls up against it here Mike Bell was a member of the EBU team which won the Camrose Trophy last week-end - the home championship in Britain and Ireland|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@h was down 1 on the other room ( board 11 )|pg||
nt|yuval10: a hugh swing for the English team|pg||
nt|othered1: does 2@H imply another suit?  @S specifically?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can save in a minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H X might be best|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h X|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it won't surprise me if N bid 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even more|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me either|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s can make a bunch of nt cant they (as the cards sit)  (need glass cards) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N correctly opens|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: East played @h under his QXX and misled declarer|pg||
nt|fokal: ok well done NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: must have missed the pitch |pg||
nt|mmmakela: ugly 1 @S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: errr either slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: are we linked to other room? |pg||
nt|400 volt: something like  10 imps :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is their 2 nt opening? |pg||
nt|raidouille: 20-21|pg||
nt|raidouille: so here it is 22-23|pg||
nt|arthurking: 6@s en EW|pg||
nt|arthurking: ou SA|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h would seem to be the limit here on best defense. Though the normal @d lead allows 4.|pg||
nt|col3435: (ugh, apologies for not being able to spell necessary)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good heavens|pg||
nt|jcomyn: greyhounds are unleashed again|pg||
nt|sybarra: please not 6 @C  can W contain himself and not X |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 1Nt shouldn't make here|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS close to values for vul 3NT here but have a @d problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|400 volt: but we'll only see the scores at the end of the session|pg||
nt|400 volt: they startet with the second last and last board of this table|pg||
nt|othered1: west bids his suits in natural order here, too.|pg||
nt|gips: another board where is better to push.....|pg||
nt|fokal: and 6 @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S plays well|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D does also|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @C slamish |pg||
nt|tomi2: OR already finished 2 more boards|pg||
nt|gips: 10 of clubs and ten of spade makes the slam reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on invite les spectateurs francophones dans cette salle de nous adresser leurs questions ou commentaires en francais s'ils preferent|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@d is relay any |pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 1@s, then rebid 4@h, is better in West's hand, if you chose to open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobholl: but relative length is unknown than|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: at least 4-4 M|pg||
nt|werge: Pass the double - and lead a trump = 800|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N in last hand and this one is good raise|pg||
nt|jcomyn: course he doubles|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like a puppet auction|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@D is one or both majors|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H or 3@S would have been 5 cards|pg||
nt|le joker: 3NT in NS, 10 tricks ..... next board please ! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: NS play precision but South didnt want to relay I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: EW is now officially in big trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: Negative free bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @d lead made it difficult for declarer. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are gadgets, not sure I can explain accurately |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C, minor suit ask,  and 3 @H=4+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: exactly 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: otherwise 3@D, i have a 5(6) card minor|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 3@S was alerted as "to play" and not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: barrage like |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: other room has started with boards 19/20|pg||
nt|400 volt: we may see what the other room played in the first board here|pg||
nt|werge: Strange bidding by West - system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do I feel about a 3 count?|pg||
nt|raidouille: 3@c stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but didnt|pg||
nt|sybarra: he didnt!|pg||
nt|yuval10: very conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is the MP and Board-a-match spot|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead beats 4 spades|pg||
nt|davidb: agressive 4Sp bid -1 |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: may be - opening 1@D looks more normal in a natural system  |pg||
nt|othered1: Slam is possible here, too, but HCP shortage will keep them out|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough discouraged ? guess not|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s follow by 4@h is exactly 5-6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Rather optimistic from W|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will end in tears!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: by any standart means|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt lebensohl 3@H syaman with ?:) stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: however he played the first week-end of the Camrose but not the 2nd|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is why ekren has been dropped by ekren himself - can be a disaster zone|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6SA mieux?|pg||
nt|arthurking: ouais enfin ils vont vite se fitter @s|pg||
nt|voldenuit: pessimiste 4@s |pg||
nt|yuval10: usually you don't X in order not to enable declarer to know where are the missing cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me they could run to 6 nt  (again seing all the cards)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they cant run anywhere|pg||
nt|yuval10: but this time around, there was no way from the beginning that declarer wouldn't guess where the mising cards are|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice effort by Sweden so far, especially considering the fact they only play 4-handed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or any lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|werge: North´s jump must be due to the fact, that they play strong @C-system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: For standings:http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even a try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, it prevents south from showing his @D support. you can make 4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just checking. Did 6@D go down on 21? If so how when no spade lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch supporters as i am don't like this :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: and things are really going from bad to worse if you're a dutch supporter|pg||
nt|copeyj: at least if you can use 2@C as weak both M you can have a way of showing no preference|pg||
nt|werge: Mais Ouest aussi - un BON 2 @S|pg||
nt|fokal: 4@s chez est me semble tres timoré |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H shows @Ss and they will finish in 3N|pg||
nt|ahalim: they won't bid it after the overcall|pg||
nt|april7: @C lead and at least9 tricks |pg||
nt|mmmakela: N likes this choice of contracts|pg||
nt|ahalim: certainly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Dbl showed 4@H he explains putting down 3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjy: http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|sybarra: E more interested now. setting the trump suit for cues  |pg||
nt|baldfriede: East will not be really satisfied with his ! stoppers.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad @S convinced him to stop in time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well judged by E|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that is well done by E so that should be that|pg||
nt|copeyj: same reason that a NT defence has to, in my view, use 2@C as M/M|pg||
nt|werge: Best spot was 2 @H - normally only 500 on the lead of the @D Ace|pg||
nt|vincenzo: made with diamonds lead ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: E will/should get trapped in the defense or a @D lead either one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: doesnt 5C make|pg||
nt|col3435: this appears to be a good "save"|pg||
nt|mrdct: safely settled in 1NT|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|tomi2: and now bid some "i feel like we should do something" double and south does not know what to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely will not put his hand on a @H lead |pg||
nt|400 volt: This splinter bid of north, showing a single/void in @C, didn't encourage south very much :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2@s showing every 12/14 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@c splinter bid|pg||
nt|werge: @H-lead will be good for the defence|pg||
nt|werge: This looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: There are some communication problems for declarer here.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, and the @H situation will be clear immediately too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as in, he hasn't got any|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S looks normal from east|pg||
nt|ady: this looks on the nail|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very true shirley and same in nt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: here its -1, even -2 if they would manage a club ruff, but often enough seen such auctions ending in just made|pg||
nt|gips: 3@H half stop|pg||
nt|ady: slam is very dicy   with 3 kings missing and 2 5-2 fits|pg||
nt|ady: it can make as the cards lay|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east sure that he wants to keep seeking out NT?  West could have a very pointed hand so far and east does have a couple of good cards for that.|pg||
nt|yuval10: still can manage -1 here, if she continue with @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now only -1|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: claim 10 and go home?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 11 unless a @h lead potentially|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to teams like Israel U-25, France U-25, Dutchies....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: went down, no spade lead,  just careless at end|pg||
nt|raidouille: big swing for Ireland|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q of @H and @C who knows C|pg||
nt|meikever: Pictures of this match: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=57 (at the bottom); alle info, results and articles at|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if N play a @c, he´s -2|pg||
nt|meikever: the website of the tournament: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|othered1: Double dummy you would have unblocked @C and pulled three rounds of trumps ending in south . . . |pg||
nt|raidouille: they may reach 4@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: The kibs are predicting 4@hs as the final contract.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some might worry that 4H could be interpreted as a cuebid. but it is a general principle that when choice of strain has not yet been decided, any bid that could be an offer to play ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should be so interpreted|pg||
nt|mmmakela: H J wasn't dropping missview|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: i thought S might have got excited after 3@S, even though 1@S was limited |pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wanted to put it mildly. :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Could be 1100|pg||
nt|copeyj: might escape for 8|pg||
nt|werge: West is happy - three @c-tricks + two Aces... - but the shop will close beforethat|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: does E blast it out? |pg||
nt|chick: he will need to use the @SQ to get to the bd|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt is down I think |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently not Puppet|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes trump miscounting or anything else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it went down, declarer had a boss heart in hand and the same number of trumps as her opponent\|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a @D lead does that help?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer will come up with 11 tricks probably|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry Yuav|pg||
nt|werge: SMALL @h this time - and let´s see|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West gets squeezed|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh is west going to be squeezed in the end|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: yeah|pg||
nt|le joker: exactly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: take yoour 3 red tricks and wait for a @c trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: 3@S on east would have focused on @H as well and might have offered a superior contract.|pg||
nt|ady: tht they would settle for 3NT     slam needs some luck|pg||
nt|col3435: I think North has to do something over 4@h, really?|pg||
nt|werge: Some communication problems|pg||
nt|mrdct: K perhaps not the best lead vs 1NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: But S hasn't time to develop a @D trick|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead helps, i predict a make. duck and duck again|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@d 1@s 2@c 1@h |pg||
nt|fokal: il fait 7@s ou 7@c avec ADxx x Axx xxxxx|pg||
nt|copeyj: oui - Ouest ne peut pas dire 3@S - c'est un 2@S normal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trusting soul E|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|col3435: that's a pretty strong hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all fascinating stuff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lead was not max|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raidouille: yes but maybe she has discarded her heart on @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he cannot miss it - 11 tricks|pg||
nt|voldenuit: enfin 1@c est au moins 2@c il sait pas ce que vaut ARDx de @c |pg||
nt|fokal: c'est juste|pg||
nt|fokal: mais il peut prospecter un peu|pg||
nt|werge: Mais 1 C = n´importe guel main minimum|pg||
nt|werge: quel|pg||
nt|voldenuit: enfin mettre 2Sa cela coûte pas grand chose |pg||
nt|werge: Sauf si - comme ici - naturel et non-forcing|pg||
nt|werge: Mais disons - ils sont coupables tout les deux - 90% par personne|pg||
nt|april7: hi everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: this gives a problem     needs k@D  for a definate entry for the clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: @S lead also makes, and even a @c or @H lead could still allow a make|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|400 volt: ruffing a @C now, @H to A, @S 10 and @S 5?|pg||
nt|400 volt: best chance for 11 tricks I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Accurate defense.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now repeat the dose in s|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to take sp finess now I think |pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: its not a good slam anyway|pg||
nt|othered1: saving the entry to @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: thinking about some safety play ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA and crossruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't really understand what is it to think about in this point|pg||
nt|yuval10: can very well play @s to A and claim|pg||
nt|mrdct: claim coming|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 7 and next|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: always -1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe W right not to x|pg||
nt|sybarra: duck! |pg||
nt|sybarra: spirit of your convictions |pg||
nt|yuval10: not enough, i'm affraid|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if he guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey but we are close!|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: No - but it´s easy to play...|pg||
nt|sybarra: there quicly will be no trumps in opps hands |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffed 1 one @D k|pg||
nt|bobholl: on|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not that it really mattered this time.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi avram, we missed you this morning|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: *quickly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is defending well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is giving this some shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi avram|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: south has a difficult decision in the end, since partner can have "only" 4 dias in their methods he can not bid them, his hearts are too weak for bidding them one more time, so he ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: goes for pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: now if he raises with the king.......|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer to open 1@C - so I am not forced to bid 2@S next time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still cheap against 4@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: should have played a higher @H on 1st trick :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: do we know who'll be on vugraph for the next rounds?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: too much bother for an overtrick in imps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Cash the @dak and run @cs pitching the @dj.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: there is not blame here,  how to you evaluate,  kxx, opposite qxx |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we continue directly, this was the slowest table|pg||
nt|sybarra: what can pard have?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should have ducked the club|pg||
nt|cindy: yes andhope for no spade shift|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why discourage opps from establishing your long suit? they are there to help you, so let them|pg||
nt|cindy: but E might be too smart for that with the 3D bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: but east won't have play a @c he knows he has 4@c |pg||
nt|col3435: South's quite good too, as it happens, but it's North who really needs to do more there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance there missed|pg||
nt|yuval10: but not enough|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he knows all distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he believe East has open 4@h with 8 , that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: he needs sp to the ace, ruff the @D,  cash ace k of sp and and spade pitching the @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be short but valiant effort |pg||
nt|yuval10: and then?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lose 2c tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: W plays @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he ruff with the J of club?|pg||
nt|yuval10: it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: still a trick short |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: boards 12 and 13 were flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: pitches @d if he believes the count |pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed Shirley|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but still not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: intersting hand nevertheless |pg||
nt|jcomyn: c first|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: most certainly is|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: J@H  will come back if he established clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is that you have nothing to lose by ducking the club. for all declarer knows, WEST might have the club 2, in which case E won't be able to tell how many clubs W has|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will cash - out his 9 now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: i think it was very unlikely that S would prefer 4H in a 4-3 fit with a bad suit instead of 5C once N has rebid that suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @c-trick cannot disapperar, so claim |pg||
pc|s9|nt|werge: Often a good plan in 3 NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks - next|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gips: safety play|pg||
nt|ady: yes   another spade will allow an overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjy: end of round 9, we will resume in 5 min|pg||
nt|xenya: however S needed to find a few specific cards with N for the slam to be good, so his signoff looks quite reasonable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this round will make some change in the standing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think a lot of people missed the 6@C, only saw 1 pair so far|pg||
nt|xenya: which is somewhat surprising|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Indeed, but thats what happened|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and no C-H squeeze either|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh, in trouble I think |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: andhe just ruined the squeeze anyway|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: may settle for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: It would take very careful defense to beat even on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not much bother actually... seeing as the squeeze materializes itself|pg||
mc|9|nt|werge: Not too well - a @s and it was 2 down with closed eyes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the play is difficult to gfollow they do not show their cards well|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are you sure oper?|pg||
nt|werge: But the @D Ace could be with East, never give up|pg||

nt|april7: helo everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|xenya: there we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Sorry we have the wrong set of boards moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Tom,  hence my question...what can pard have?|pg||
nt|tomi2: those scores are the ones you must avoid in team matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @S opener on that hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: but everyone has own opinion |pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match at http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57 (at the bottom)|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice score :) |pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt made|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trappy hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4 imps probably|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6C?  what chances of getting there|pg||
nt|yuval10: against 4@s making 5|pg||
nt|werge: All but @D Ace-King by E/W|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he had it made with a h exit did he not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could have:  Kx  Kxx   Qx   Kxxxxx, in which case you want to be in clubs|pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: went a bit fast but he indeed tried te squeeze and failed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 4@h on EW|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzjy: NS play strong 1@C with canapé|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2@S next time?|pg||
nt|400 volt: the same here, but it's the same problem as the problem with the chicken and the egg :) who has been first?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after I open a sp,  not much choice I suppose |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek explaining 13th board: I didn't know what I bid, I didn't know how i played... didn't make sense at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, up to that point :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and this time, there won;t be any score correction due to a ruff :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 6@c on EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 6 (or even 7) @C|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow, we get some boards this round|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: lots of ruffs here in 4@H|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3N might make though|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: its not easy to reach 4 @S, but we will see|pg||
nt|tomi2: even if this goes -1, you gain only 3 imps but it will cost you a lot of energy to defend such contracts|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S thought declarer had Ax? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: declarer claimed for 7 tricksand the defenders accepted|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never 7 missing CK|pg||
nt|othered1: More potential action and lots of duplication EW.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Sandie.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sandie,,(I think is our operator)  any discusson at the table re 5 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: what exciting place are we going to be here?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: W has to ruff and is endplayed good lord|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 1@S for me with the west hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, W and S has 7@s between them, but....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too|pg||
nt|yuval10: unfortunately they don't play with each other|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everbody's x.|pg||
nt|mrdct: good @S slam for NS here|pg||
nt|april7: now we have a 4@H contract by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: you always know, that every mistakes costs millions|pg||
nt|raidouille: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I just dont pass with the N hand anyone else?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Sa  en EO|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as long as they stay there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 800 if all pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In vulnerable i think 3@d is a bad bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s? |pg||
nt|april7: neg. or penalty?|pg||
nt|werge: A rather lucky 4 @H for a beginning|pg||
nt|ady: south a bit stuck   may double|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 26 crds you want to be in @D but with 52 ??|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice pass from North, never open weak 2 ( or multy, in their case ) when you have 4 cards in the other major!|pg||
nt|yuval10: I pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@c now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: follows by 3@d from E, if it shows strength, then no stopping before 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for 1nt so 2nt now ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D must be forcing.  Wonder how far?|pg||
nt|werge: Could we check South´s age please? It´s a junior 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand again or should be    9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: none at all|pg||
nt|cindy: surprised no preempt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yawn... yes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: EW made 5 dias on   21|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Morning Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Hans, Vladimir, Ralf and Gerbrand|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@s in EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning Sandie - any imporovement|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bid 3 @C with S |pg||
nt|werge: Bid 4 @S first round|pg||
nt|werge: - and one down|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s probably 3@s's and minimum?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ok, had some problems since we lost connection hope everything is fine now again|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i think 1@s too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on EW might be hard with a trumph lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: neg. :)|pg||
nt|april7: thats what I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Neg - at that´s why you should PASS with that hand!|pg||
nt|werge: Mojn|pg||
nt|xenya: a very lucky 4@H for NS here, but i don't think they'll get that high|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it looks as if operator is catching up with events.|pg||
nt|chick: I think the operator is getting up caught up on the boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: will check|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: should make, just have to bid it|pg||
nt|mrdct: a danger for NS is void opposite the @CA|pg||
nt|mrdct: either or both could misevaluate their hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: west looking at his 3 small dias and visualizing possible 6 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok give him a cup of coffee|pg||
nt|gips: absolutly disagree on west pass|pg||
nt|ady: a situation not to re-open   3 cards to an honor inovercall|pg||
nt|raidouille: hum ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: denies support double ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even that, also a void!|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@c est le soutien mineur inversée au moins 11 pts |pg||
nt|voldenuit: 5@c gagne aussi |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and maybe X instead of 2@C?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if only for THAT sequence|pg||
nt|cindy: white vs red   looks good to me|pg||
nt|raidouille: 3@c is obvious with this vulnerability|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree. even 4C would not be outrageous (unless conventional)|pg||
nt|mrdct: now is a good time to have your methods sorted out|pg||
nt|krutik: nice auction|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: hello Roland, Hans and Ralph|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Tim,  we even appreciatie that |pg||
nt|othered1: north, east and south bid normally here|pg||
nt|cindy: what is that pass ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, vg operating is a very tough job.  For some reason the players seem to have other things on their minds rather than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E opened a @H here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: def -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they are still very upbeat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is gameforce|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, there is a chance to score all their trumps in 4@h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now they are in the soup|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the suit that was never mentioned here|pg||
nt|april7: after E opening S might reach 4@H but 4@S by W is also a possibility but 5 @H is a good save|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can be interesting with 3 rounds of @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk1: ranking at : http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/USS_2_Page1.do?event=goToPage14&rndid=52208&verid=3&catid=|pg||
nt|sybarra: more likely (imo) that pard has Ax |pg||
nt|sybarra: is it too early for a beer? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: The guy doesn't drink coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe that explains|pg||
nt|werge: Another luck for N/S - that West is declarer|pg||
nt|ady: pass from south reasonable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what system are EW playing?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@C 3nt after answer is @C interest ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h might still make|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h, 1@c , 1@d|pg||
nt|davidb: very good bid by W  -looking for no 2 losers in D.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: I open every 5-5 in black with 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I would show @S+@C if possible in 1st bid...|pg||
nt|werge: - but this was not opening, I see...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I want to show my twosuiter as fast as possible and not in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|werge: 800 - and now you must fight hard to get 420|pg||
nt|april7: and wait for the <|pg||
nt|sybarra: how we doing now?  Rehi |pg||
nt|pelu: ok - them whisky :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Danger zone for EW|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: takes A@S lead or @c lead and @s switch|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this hand will not be fun to declare|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I don't think he iwll lead a red suit|pg||
nt|le joker: fred can lead Q of @d ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not at all... -4 potentially|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|cindy: think they would have ended in same spot with a preempt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N accepts any try with max and prime values,even @C spl |pg||
nt|ahalim: some exclusion ace asking could solve it|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@C intended as a splinter (maybe void?)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|400 volt: at least he saw he didn't play v well, so he maybe doesn't need coffee :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would pass |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think N has a good opener, but I am outnumbered obviously|pg||
nt|santyclz: Might have x'd 2@h to show approximately this hand.|pg||
nt|col3435: this is a textbook elimination hand, I think?|pg||
nt|werge: If South bids 4 @S direclly, West might lead the @h 10!!!|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north opened 1@D.. @D lead too dangerous|pg||
nt|le joker: ok ! nice lead :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@c would have been automatic back in the middle ages when I was a junior.|pg||
nt|cindy: just be from the other side|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: and wait for the X by E and pas!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think we're good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East doubled,not west|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bold double by West, but it looks as though it will pay off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, East doubled.|pg||
nt|othered1: Good that void-showing response didn't take them too high|pg||
nt|jujux: Actuellement la France U25 est 1ère avec 189 tandis que la Pologne U25 est 5ieme avec 158|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wins the post mortem.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Open found the 6@C slam also|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like at least +300|pg||
nt|yuval10: but maybe South think about bidding 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A@C and a @s switch to make it -4|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3/5 leads from the Swedes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont think it will make|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are cueing 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|mrdct: so they need to have good'ol blackwood available to make sure they aren't off an ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: all artificial|pg||
pc|d6|nt|werge: May be they play 2 @S as showing NO stopper in the suit|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a misunderstanding concerning 3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: We are up and live now..|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hoi Gerband|pg||
nt|werge: But 9 tricks without any problem|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, partner must have that ace, but still I think north should not double this holding no trump trick and only one ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: Peter,  a it early for the hard stuff dont you think?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should make, though|pg||
nt|bobholl: aH HA|pg||
nt|werge: But you can defeat 5 @D - @C-lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes buty a club would be led|pg||
nt|april7: trump lead is best, so W might not be able to ruff a @S in dummy but now an unexpected 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is easy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: not 4@S with a weak two @H i agree too|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like EW stopped right on time|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd by East|pg||
nt|yuval10: save the day|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed didnt like 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep , i guess he is :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks reasonable|pg||
nt|werge: But costs 420|pg||
nt|mrdct: now we are in danger of a 7@S accident|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now S bids 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: he removed 6@S from his bidding box|pg||
nt|ahalim: maybe not after the 5@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Now starts to think again|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes 5@C should tell south to put the brakes on|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|santyclz: W made 3nt on bd 21 when n (once again) failed to lead his pd's suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you guess it Yuval |pg||
nt|yuval10: and E should X|pg||
nt|yuval10: but the only problem is....|pg||
nt|yuval10: E is on lead :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N must have about what he has for bidding|pg||
nt|meikever: for results, pictures and articles about the most interesting bords of the tournament: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: no worries, Wessel, we appreciate you taking the trouble to enter these|pg||
nt|voldenuit: hard bid for East 4@d for majors or 2@d and then 2@s hard choice :) |pg||
nt|werge: - or @C-swiths|pg||
nt|ady: might get an end play for down 1    Birman will get chances to play a club to stop end play|pg||
nt|ady: sorry tht South had Q9 doubleton     no end play   down 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: if only to show he doesn't want a @s lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: hi Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe forced to play the hts correctly here |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably take a chance of transferring to something |pg||
nt|meikever: next match in 50 minutes is Sweden - Croatia... see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=28&Itemid=56 for the upcoming vugraph matches|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is impressive by E|pg||
nt|werge: switch|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's that duplication problem, but EW went right |pg||
nt|werge: Was´nt tgat, what I meant...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice defense|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: too much bidding here for my liking|pg||
nt|werge: But the kids like it...|pg||
nt|april7: now we see the aggressivness, looking for a slam, but were?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s easier to lead trumps from N|pg||
nt|april7: W might continue|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats what I mean|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H is cold, even with a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2d is 3 plus h invite or better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will he ruff high and and finess in @h?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3rd dias and I bet down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet i euro he makes it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: you're on!|pg||
nt|davidb: looks -1 ;unfortunately. normal  to play A &then finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an euro on finess or making the contract?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: makes it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|werge: Sorry, only @c-lead works|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead just isn't findable|pg||
nt|werge: With about a 10-card fit N/S?|pg||
nt|werge: that|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt? Partner bid 3@d over 2@s!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Wiith a careful play he will make.  4@d, 1@h 2@c (or 3) and 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT might show no 3 cards @h and no 4 cards @s, so East knew her partner has 5@c's perhas ( maybe with 4-4 they open 1@d )|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: need to play this carefully|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it should make|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: might lose too many trumps|pg||
nt|april7: since @H breaks,contract succeeds, ruffing a @S in dummy inspite trump lead, playing @S from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2nt is GF 3 cl asking  cuebids and a good end in 4 h|pg||
nt|mmmakela: makes 11 if guesses dias(and spades)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the ranking is after 8 rounds of 6 boards, 7 rounds of 6 boards today.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H now and pray|pg||
nt|april7: S hand was good enough to show @H and @C, by certain convention, like 2NT the way I play it: 4 @H and longer @C!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|werge: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: only @C back defeat 2@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: (or ducking @D Ace)|pg||
nt|400 volt: because you have no quick entry to the @D for discarding @S Q|pg||
nt|yuval10: N has no entry to this contract is bound to make|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1430 ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can make now.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: cards couldn't be more friendly except @H A right|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree also Tom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always nice to have the ace of trumps when you have made your "book" against a doubled contract|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 5@c est pas un bon contrat il faut deviner à @d ou as dame sec et les @h 3/3 ou dame seconde |pg||
nt|fokal: oui|pg||
nt|ady: was the lead the 9 of clubs?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this wont take long after west decides what to do|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S's 2-2 and@D's 3-3, but declarer doen't know it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: impossible to find a way to go down|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl thinking what to do if @S are 3-1and the @D Jack does't fall |pg||
nt|mrdct: yes perhaps not as easy as we think it is looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|april7: must take first @H in dummy|pg||
nt|davidb: -1 10 Euro|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: its not a hard fight|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done the girls|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess neither N could polymorph a @H or @S into a @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes |pg||
nt|yuval10: can't really go wrong here, so the decision of South paid off|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: If 1@c is strong I agree with 2nt. In my opinion 3@c shows a better suit than Q on top|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's hand is a lot more suited to play in suit than in NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: many aces, no spots in the side suits...|pg||
nt|othered1: Big swing on the last board, when NS found their 4-4 @D fit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has to lead a club first or second chance to beat this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no you know the W player|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: @D now and discard @S on hight @D later|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: east can pitch @S if they play @H and north ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, trump. |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: he showed that (more or less) with the 3nt answer on CBS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjy: South asked if North would be 4@H after invite.. but eh said no|pg||
nt|sybarra: helpful defense |pg||
nt|cindy: can they beat 3 ?|pg||
nt|cindy: i didnt see that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i meant 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: didnt even look to see W's final bid, assumed automatically they were in game, sorry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: But North shoul have taken the Jack of @D - to play @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushy X  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Excuses, excuses...|pg||
nt|col3435: just like that ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I suspect E can see it coming |pg||
nt|col3435: if no-one ruffed the top diamonds, you'd just ruff your little one, then play a trump to endplay whoever had the @hQ|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done East - if West revokes now, he's in trouble |pg||
nt|chick: E could see he was at risk of being endplayed, so he cashed the @CA and exited safely|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer can play up Q@h now to hold it to -1.|pg||
nt|mrdct: now its easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dramatic|pg||
nt|davidb: trying to get count . |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: trying to get a count|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: he could find a bid on 2@S showing his minor holding, like 2NT would be in my methods (6 cards in opened suit, 4 in other minor)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nd ant 4th |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now might drop the kingleton|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: this is probably not the "match killer" hand|pg||
nt|pelu: u are richt Felix|pg||
nt|bobholl: going for overtricks now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But E really got a helping hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: After N switched, declarer knows for sure where A@c and K@d are|pg||
nt|yuval10: she|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dan_ehh: well done|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|werge: But with East as declarer, it´s easier|pg||
nt|werge: With such a South-hand, do´nt run an info-office...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: risky business|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: if N had any of those he'd have played another @h probably|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fokal: le declarant chute s'il joue AR de @h et @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: there are some down-sides of playing 1@h as transfers then|pg||
pc|sT|nt|werge: But 4 @s is NOT transfer|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: problem fpr west   if he bids  partner might bid 3 clubs   which he does not really want to hear|pg||
nt|april7: over 1@D and over 1@S: 2@S is 4@H and longer @C, always good opening hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: crossroads|pg||
pc|h7|nt|400 volt: but now he defeated himself?|pg||
nt|yuval10: so looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|bobholl: there's the up|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if I might go back to the N hand - KQJxxx is a suit I want to play in, not anything else. This 4-4 fit is overrated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Therefore he should have set pressure on E by continuing with @h|pg||
nt|fokal: il est raccourci|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S wasn't thinking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Queen pl - i cant afford a euro|pg||
nt|davidb: S showed 5clubs - than Q is right N  3262|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tension growing|pg||
nt|davidb: very close decision|pg||
nt|krutik: luck factor comes into play here|pg||
nt|davidb: the more he thinks the better chances to guess !|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @hQ is right, otherwist N had opened with 3@d on 4162|pg||
nt|davidb: not sure 2 clubs ..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: it´s too risky with a 4@card major besides|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the 3NT hand, EW had five chances to put a spade on the table. better communication or more careful analysis is advised|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice try|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for a junior Ralf? |pg||
mc|10|nt|jcomyn: ok will send a cheque|pg||

nt|werge: Few loosers N/S - but not so many tricks either|pg||
nt|werge: But might give N/S 1 point|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  and of course 1 imp can be "killer"|pg||
nt|werge: Here it´s not about 1 point|pg||
nt|400 volt: but lost the plot later|pg||
nt|400 volt: 12 IMPs for the netherlands|pg||
nt|chick: a nice 3N here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one part of the problem was that when E returned clubs he led the deuce on the second round of the suit, which presumably suggested to W that clubs were 4441 around the table, so ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not cash them?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4-4 fit might be overrated, but how about a possible 5-4 fit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: it might be a pity to open 2@h and play in 6-1 fit while you have 5-4 fit in @s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: possible of course, but wasnt the idea of Benji or Multi to pre-empt|pg||
nt|bobholl: you will miss some slams also by taking up bidding space :)|pg||
nt|werge: In the good old days, N/S would just bid 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: well "lets not be in 6 @C" with n/s |pg||
nt|yuval10: but why would he bid 4@s ?|pg||
nt|werge: Did you see his hand?|pg||
nt|yuval10: p never had void @s ?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but still an annoying -1|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nicely played for -1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now for some action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W needs to be comparing his hand to a Yarborough in deciding whether to bid game over the superaccept|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dJ was´nt best defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they get to 6C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c on EW or even 6@c?|pg||
nt|werge: Was best for declarer|pg||
nt|april7: if you succeed to ruff 2 @D in W's hand 12 tricks are available in @C|pg||
nt|davidb: 10 Euro please|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning from Sweden|pg||
nt|werge: Morning "hinsidan"|pg||
nt|april7: if N doesn't bid after 1NT then W plays 1NT, but N could bid DONT and play perhaps 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a partscore in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S on?|pg||
nt|werge: It´s impossible to get less than 12 tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is fabulous venue btw |pg||
nt|sybarra: White House, in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|ahalim: ok they're still young and hopefully learn from their mistakes|pg||
nt|gips: but the chance not to find fit in partner's hand are reduced for the high number of diamond opening bid cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have some tired puppies here|pg||
nt|le joker: :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: back again|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if 2 C natural I'd bid it but otherwise pass(previous)|pg||
nt|april7: hre it would have been:1@D 2@D 4@S 5@H!!!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tomi2: yes, they are the unter 20 team, so they have 5 years or more as juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: U20's need to get back in the game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wessel, you need to shut dowm and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|raidouille: they have played all day long|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from W now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well anyway I have two good supporters - David Bird agrees with me as does Andy Robson|pg||
nt|voldenuit: vont ils s'arrêter avant la manche |pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@h = is par for EW|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 11 card fits are always fun|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|april7: or some other convention after NT|pg||
nt|xenya: questionable whether they will find the fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: will start next week |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @D from North, pls|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gerbrand, playing there now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they are playing at white house now|pg||
nt|400 volt: (4 @S X -4, as we might have expected)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|bobholl: even with Negative Free bids a nasty w hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H NS about all here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Juniors today seem much more discipled that when we were that age.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to guess @H's amd can make 4 @H here  |pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i saw|pg||
nt|baardolav: partner had shode 3card supp|pg||
nt|yuval10: and i still don't think South should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy though|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ahalim: some action now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: who cares if u got xxxx in spades on the side|pg||
mb|3D!|an|good raise|nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @D might get E/W overboard|pg||
nt|meikever: next match on vugraph in 45 min is: Belgium - Netherlands Red U25 .. see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for the full playing schedule, articles and pictures|pg||
nt|ady: again a low part score      2 clubs n/s   not much else|pg||
nt|raidouille: from 12 to now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ready to party now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @S or 3nt ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 3@d is quite on overbid, you have 3 small @h's and only 11 points and you essentially force the partnership to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt maybe |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: tempting to bid with the west hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|ahalim: he heard you :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS have a good save in 5@h vs 4@S EW|pg||
nt|werge: I se NO looginh option in 6 @C|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT will fail and 5 @C might be the contract, but with aggressivnes s who knows|pg||
nt|werge: loosing...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-bid something of a problem here|pg||
nt|april7: for all cases where you have only 4 cards in one major and not 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: That West-hand is too strong to be a 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but difficult to find|pg||
nt|werge: So - 1430, next board|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is refurbished tennis facility (12+ courts) and a fabulous building, patio etc. ) perfect for the bridge tourney |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ok|pg||
nt|raidouille: beer time |pg||
nt|yuval10: Boa, i meant in first bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 1@c|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4sp is okey|pg||
nt|werge: But at that moment it was too late, North bid @S|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's what Hans was refering to, also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: was thinking of bidding 2@C instead|pg||
nt|ahalim: because in Polish the 1@D cannot be short, E can freely jump-raise|pg||
nt|april7: a little too weak for responsive X|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an expensive board - from +800 to - 50|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: will need Gerbrand to remind me of names,  but 2 gentlemen purchased the facility and tuned it into fine place it is (of course they are bridge players:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does W bid?  5 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East left to toilet..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be sick,  he has the good hand LOL|pg||
nt|gips: too high now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good stuff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: test the vul pair|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we are in the "save" again |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the wrong had |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I like 5C muddies the water somewhat|pg||
nt|yuval10: undoubled now?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: how many would bid 5@C and how many 4@S?|pg||
nt|davidb: too agressive 2NT vul ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Okay...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Ralf and Hans|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like 120|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy:  Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford,|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Gerbrand,  I just could not remember the names |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North telling SW, that East left|pg||
nt|werge: West can see his own @H-holding - so he knows, that Easts 4 @D is a big hand with self-made @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and does 5 @S say W has control of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tricky stuff |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think many of us "plain vanilla" types would bid 5 @H |pg||
nt|werge: When I was a junior, I opened the West-hand with 1 NT - suppose they play 15-17 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hey i thought WE were the ones who were susceptible to fatigue ! these are youth !!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the venue is conducive to that with little bar at one end of main room |pg||
nt|bobholl: old fashioned alcol 10-12 2nt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and no bargain|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5 if you play for it.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (disciplined)|pg||
nt|werge: Not for a @c-system|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: and Gerbrand, our operator|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT is a winner - as both minors behave extremely well|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what system north-south plays?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: goodnight vienna|pg||
nt|jcomyn: uh oh|pg||
nt|werge: After this explanation of 2 @C - I put my money on 1370, if NOT doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: you are very aggressive Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does 5 !N ask for club control?|pg||
nt|werge: For Aces - 4 NT was not available|pg||
nt|sybarra: an told:   5@S good hand with spades, 5NT ace asking|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C sh be a 5-6 card suit - why not 3@C??|pg||
nt|bobholl: lead a @H !|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with this lead, declarer only have 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 8 tricks now but carefull discarding necessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what about that lead?|pg||
nt|yuval10: S can still have a time to rise with the A@c and switch to @h|pg||
nt|arthurking: bizarre ce coup en main au 9 de @h fredo na aps rejoué @h ? il voir le mort pour tant et il sait que E na plus d atouts|pg||
nt|werge: Le mot est surencgerir - ou?|pg||
nt|werge: cherir...|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW mak 4@H ....... 5@C also|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63   for results and standing after round 11|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|yuval10: for results and more|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S might've presaved to pressure W|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @D - just a helt for E/W|pg||
nt|werge: help|pg||
nt|jcomyn: worse than that it is a swing of 18 imps - |pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: we can probably refill our coffee's on this hand |pg||
nt|400 volt: why 3 @C? because you found your fit - I don't know what 2 @C after X is in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: "do we play TIC"",Tim asks|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it shld be made |pg||
nt|sybarra: the White House is a fabulous venue, old tennis club with about 10+ courts still in operation and wonderful renovated club house|pg||
nt|mariner1: o 23 EW are in 5@S DBL so could be a huge swing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened the 5-3 h fit|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: bit hard to find|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: tough to find|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed 5@H by S is good|pg||
nt|mrdct: south saves the day |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: why was south bidding|pg||
nt|gips: it looks like a kind of precision|pg||
nt|werge: Without @H-lead, declarer must find the 9th trick in @D, but then loosing five red tricks|pg||
nt|ady: club and a heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C was likely a limit @H raise or better|pg||
nt|le joker: 3NT |pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@c for the lead.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to confess I bid 4S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: quite strong for 3 @D|pg||
nt|ahalim: but now W may start a @D|pg||
nt|april7: @D lead helps but not enough|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: missed nothing ?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, declarer still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: best thing for declarer is probably play @c right away, while South is still on the dark|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does everyone agree with the lead?|pg||
nt|col3435: aw, that hurts doesn't it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yess|pg||
nt|sybarra: look at bd 15 in the other room |pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is too much.... a lot of losers and only 7 spades, not to mention that the suit isn't copletely solid|pg||
nt|werge: K x in @D counts same direction, OVER|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, that's a bit tough after a 2@d bid though|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this should make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unusual for a junior to pass the W hand here over 1C, but Lorenzine showed on the previous hand a more conservative style than most|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lucky make here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|werge: No - I just want to point out, that with so many intermediats + a good 5-card suit, you ar too strong|pg||
nt|werge: Service double - good for East to know...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  we have landed as they say |pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel U25 are title holders here and they are among the favorites in this event. Others will be Netherlands 1 (I think its red, so we will see them next match), France and Poland ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: imo|pg||
nt|400 volt: what is TIC?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: transfers in competition|pg||
nt|400 volt: ah :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Polish @C, I'm told by several specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if nonvul, or if W were not a 3rd seat opener, E might bid 1NT over the double, but under these actual conditions Pass is well-advised|pg||
nt|fokal: oui c'est étonnant de la part d'un joueur de cette qualité|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is in Open|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they did so well to push em over the cliff and then jumped after them|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: no double?|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5-level decisions are really hard|pg||
nt|mrdct: i have lots of sympathy for west's 5@S bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|werge: Anyway - E/W landed fine|pg||
nt|april7: now NS missed 3@S|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see good handling of the @D-suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is where, if North held @DKJ10x, he should double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards Yes!|pg||
nt|santyclz: E's 4@h here could easily be Hx, so w has a real problem.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: west has two aces and her partner bid twice vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: W doesnt believe 2 aces cashing obviously|pg||
nt|santyclz: Strange.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|werge: Could´nt East bid 3 @H instead of 4@C?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: as it is, of course, he doesn't|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - with the @D Ace by partner, it works|pg||
nt|yuval10: East panicked... too bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: two ducks then D ace, another D|pg||
nt|ahalim: most players would bid it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after N's dbl 5 @S bid little questionable, guess it's ok|pg||
nt|mrdct: west has undisclosed 5 card @S support and a void - what else can she do?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|werge: Who ducked...?|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match on: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=57 (on the bottom)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: e can hardly bid it now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D in third seat not unreasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Juniors today are far more disciplined than we were, and much better players.|pg||
nt|davidb: not easy to  X|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|400 volt: obviously not :-)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Agreed.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to lead a heart, but nine tricks now |pg||
nt|werge: Is they continue @h´s - it will be good to unblock dummy´s King!|pg||
nt|ady: maybe north sometimes has a major with this opening    jsut the same south should not have bid|pg||
nt|gips: very hard now for west, he should play @H for 1 down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only chance (though slight) to hold it to 4 was a @s back.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: well NS have 6 top tricks -- still a chance they will take them|pg||
nt|sybarra: take ace of @C,  and E claims,  (as long as no ruff)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey,  you are not that old Felix |pg||
nt|pelu: so they dont know the system??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: not a usual partnership no|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek plays with danny Moolenaar, Stuurman is with Frank Visser|pg||
nt|arthurking: pour sa defense, on ne dort pas bcp et c'est assez intense les journée c'est 12 a 22 Hàà|pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: You mean 4 @S|pg||
nt|april7: on @S lead only 3|pg||
nt|werge: If you do´nt start with 3 x "S, 10 yricks are easy|pg||
nt|werge: 2 x @D|pg||
nt|april7: but they are experts and lead 3x@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6  of @D|pg||
nt|yuval10: surely a good score for Sweden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: but Frank had job conflicts and could not play this event |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes, his new job started at.... march 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: take it or leave it offer|pg||
nt|sybarra: good timing to get a job,  but bad time for bridge events |pg||
nt|le joker: i would bid 3NT in N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: confession is good for the soul|pg||
nt|cindy: noyt sure why he is thinking   he just cannot let W in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are no options here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may be thinking about intrafinesse, but that is an illusion|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c8 may be a big card.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: intrafinesse works when W has Tx, but if so the ace works just as well, he does not need an overtrick....if spades are 4-4 and W has Tx of D, then intrafinesse is only chance but ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very unlikely|pg||
pc|c6|nt|werge: 3 x @S|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: old tennis club? so we can expect doubles?|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this round are up: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Meike,  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing play|pg||
nt|werge: Malchance que 3 @H gagne|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: Now East is short og ONE entry...|pg||
nt|werge: of ONE|pg||
nt|sybarra: and venue shown well here|pg||
nt|yuval10: Bas Van Beijsterveldt also noted the importancy if playing for @c before the defenders can gather information about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: too late|pg||
nt|mrdct: on a good day 5@S will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed. switch the @HK to the @CQ and 5@S is good|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: Declarer will probably take them from the top.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: can still make by finessing in trump now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: the dutch preempt style is very aggressive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dan_ehh: north probably expected his partner to have a much worse hand than the one he actually held|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: holds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: question is did N have a "good raise" imo not|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|voldenuit: carole is thinking if @d are 5/2 or 4/3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Women are from Venue?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with nopen cards there is an endplay on W. To avoid this he must play @h!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gips: 2 of @D was suit preference, west did not follow his partner|pg||
nt|raidouille: and now ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E's club plays ask for H switch|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: starting with Q was a better idea because E short in @H orobably|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: Let´s be kind - next board|pg||
nt|april7: 1h TO q AND ANOTHER RUFF|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now S in trouble|pg||
nt|april7: @H@H and down you go a lot|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is quite a facility they are playing at  The White House in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - no point messing about|pg||
nt|april7: all suits break well|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: migth be the @DK cannot see that clearly|pg||
nt|april7: since its down already W will try @H for sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: 16 imps for England on board 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT was down 2 on the other room, but even had it make, it was still a massive 11 imps from England|pg||
nt|yuval10: our last match of the day is France U-25 VS Italy|pg||
nt|yuval10: should be an interesting one|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: @h ace might not cash, but still have to double |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: well couldnt keep up, 3 off|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: but 3@D 1 down also ok|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a renovated tennis facility and absolutely beatiful! |pg||
nt|voldenuit: west in return to hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: oops the down trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: they won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: squeaked out |pg||
nt|mdgraham: could claim|pg||
nt|cindy: that wasnt good|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: Good morning, North.... |pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 2@H down only 2 still coming :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes it's better from team's prespective to have a bad board for both pairs in the same board|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yuval10: it's down now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: they still have active about 10+ tennis courts, patio, and playing facility with little bar area |pg||
nt|raidouille: 3-3 or 4/2 @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: South will have no choice but to play A@c and play small @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: you lose less imps that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: how many tricks did he make?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: now E must play @d to avoid endplay against W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d K from the hand now!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|voldenuit: hard to find |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|raidouille: ruff and @s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: Still OK - nice 600|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: so he didn't handle diamonds at all :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
mc|9|nt|werge: This is probably a 73% slam|pg||

nt|april7: what a misfit!!|pg||
nt|xenya: mind you, N didn't know W had @Cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes, agree,  and I dont want him to go on,  "place the contract"  and be done |pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, but when I was a junior there was no GW Bush there, and I dont expect Obama to be there :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a chance for the U20's here |pg||
nt|sybarra: might even be a gain for Neth. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could end in 4@Sx |pg||
nt|werge: But they were very close to stay in 2 @D|pg||
nt|ady: slipped through|pg||
nt|ady: dont think go go down on K@D lead   |pg||
nt|othered1: cold be some action here with 4@S on and 5@C a possible save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: France needs to get on the board|pg||
nt|raidouille: French have to score some imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: the Swedes survived this one|pg||
nt|yuval10: this board might be interesting, if South opens 1@h and W decide to X|pg||
nt|arthurking: Cedric et Ch. ont declaré 6@h en salle Ouverte|pg||
nt|arthurking: 6@s|pg||
nt|werge: J´epere @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: look at bd 4! |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is early morning (or was) for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could liven things up|pg||
nt|werge: Funny 3 NT N/S - E/W must bring in the 9th trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: yes, the club pips proved useful|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 nt very common in N nowadays |pg||
nt|yuval10: with a little help from friends.... :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice MP result, that's for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: no Hans! they had only 2 @h and 2@s trisks|pg||
nt|april7: desaster strikes everywhere|pg||
nt|gips: 5@C as save??? they could be made on spade lead|pg||
nt|voldenuit: what wld you bid with north hand? after 1@h |pg||
nt|sybarra: should tell the ladies to "pull up their sox"  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3NT may bring a lot back|pg||
nt|werge: espere|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: there w eare|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h P 1@s...|pg||
nt|april7: 9 ticks for EW and 10 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it wont be nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: pity indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: instead she elect to overcall 2@c, which is reasonable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on E?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: There we go :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@C-2@D-2@h-3@D?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in OR N took the presave and got dbld|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: tricks....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: but south said, you get 2 more..|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  not sure why it is called White House, perhaps a dutch friend can tell me |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Well it is a plain white building|pg||
nt|sybarra: that might be one reason |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and they probably where out of inspiration|pg||
nt|tomi2: this board reminds me of a discussion we had in our team in beijing, does a passed hand have a GF-Fit raise available?|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of @Hs with that fiendly layout|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S will land in 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is baseball expression)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's the opposite of my usual sort of advice|pg||
nt|raidouille: Open room : 3NT is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we could say "take them off"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT?|pg||
nt|raidouille: 2NT is 3 trumps invitationnal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 is enough i believe|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 nt is enough imo|pg||
nt|ady: if North double    South will probably remove  tp 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might want to try to defend|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  good contract for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here again|pg||
nt|yuval10: if W pass we can see some Gazilli here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4@c opening got them to 4@s, but since n was on lead and had bid @cs he led a @h.|pg||
nt|april7: its an interesting 7@S contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can make 13 in spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|400 volt: yes, 5 @H possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: and W should pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: a sligth manche inv with S but 2@D 2@H 2nt ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h = 3@h's maybe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thin double|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: (gazzili prediction)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: best contract is pass now|pg||
nt|april7: what about  N? W is not afraid at all|pg||
nt|othered1: Real trouble isgetting @C into the auction, very tough here|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to save now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But they will have problems making it.|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  a value raise in spades I assume|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S could be tricky|pg||
nt|arthurking: J aurais dit Passe aussi , yen a qui disent 1sa ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: we have a problem with the connection to the OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer's play would only succeed there if E started with KQTx of diamonds--2 winning cases. but ace wins when W has singleton ten, Q or K--3 cases|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not bid of course|pg||
nt|april7: not even 6 I think|pg||
nt|ahalim: and my grandma will certainly make it, she takes every finesse in sight :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well actually 12 might be the limit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: This should be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West: When I played 4crd M openings pd always has more fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: will they bid 4?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2 off probably |pg||
nt|sybarra: making 6 @C in the other room |pg||
nt|sybarra: and X'd also |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: 1N wasnt forcing but south bid 2@C anyway..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cue's start a force |pg||
nt|400 volt: in IMPs not impossible to bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or not after this multi opening.|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2 points are lost in @c |pg||
nt|sybarra: asked for a @D lead, agree with specs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and then what...|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@D, I guess that shows @Ds, but how strong?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: can north pass now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like South selected the pesimistic approach for his hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 NT shd make?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: there are two schools of thought about defending Multis - one, as here, is to wait until opener has defined and then double for take-out |pg||
nt|chick: EW could get to a very makeable 4@H, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i assumed that was the meaning but still i'd say "?"|pg||
nt|bobholl: should ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: must? :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: thin @C true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now East will X|pg||
nt|ady: east short of entries|pg||
nt|yuval10: lucky that we have our loyal spectator Rosaline B. to supply as the results :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think so|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: he sees the misfit so downgraded|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: not bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose it´s early in Holland....|pg||
nt|april7: what? S doesn't X???|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt South paid his inscription!?!|pg||
nt|april7: no confidence in partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont you love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another is to double immediately with 13-16 or 20+ balancedish.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah you fellas are getting old lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: this contract has no play whatsoever|pg||
nt|bobholl: couragous X|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh agreed u feel sorry when this happens|pg||
nt|ady: duck best|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl still has to work hard here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tough 3 NT to make|pg||
nt|mrdct: there will be some nervous moments for delcarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I see what you mean but he showed @h so 2@h had been Jacobyr without a @h control|pg||
nt|sybarra: very friendly layout,  can they make 4?  with the @D's not behaving well?|pg||
nt|400 volt: very passive by south|pg||
nt|yuval10: couragous?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'd say automatic|pg||
nt|col3435: this isn't the world's best contract, but maybe North will need to find a heart switch in a minute|pg||
nt|mugsmate: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Jon :)|pg||
nt|meikever: In 55 min we will show Italy - Israel U25... see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for all the info and the upcoming matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx meike |pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd board was a push at 3@c -1 , and the 3rd one Net. gained an imp on 3NT + 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@d is like 6-8 so yes, it's good. it's important for P to know your range do decide whether to go on or not with like 19|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 not|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: can't |pg||
nt|xenya: everything wrong for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East starts asking about the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: now "we" just have to make it |pg||
nt|tomi2: one teammate holding a very similar hand bid 2@S in this situation, that is normaly GF in their methods, intending to show a "verrry maximum hand" but to pass partners 3@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2NT would be invitational and require extras from partner for game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have pushed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT must be better if East can get West to play it - picture @H10 coming through Qxx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for @H10 lead?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am a real senior :)|pg||
nt|werge: Double-dummy: 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Le probleme avec 1 SA - d´est la mauvaise main qui joue, ci partenaire est fort|pg||
nt|arthurking: J aurais dit 2@h sur 1@s perso|pg||
nt|santyclz: May end in 2@ds.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but not 3 - boy oh boy now it is down to 22 pts for 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so muchfor the old school of 26|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahalim: and this is not so easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have no @S,  why not?|pg||
nt|pelu: he had placed a @H in the @D-suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: ironical :)|pg||
nt|aruf: hi all |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is touch and go.......|pg||
nt|april7: 3@S can be beaten on @H lead and @C ruff, but 5 @C also 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: EW couldn't stay below game after E's opening|pg||
nt|ahalim: seven can be made double dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit high!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: given the state of the match and especially the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: @d10 finessed for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 10 tricks assuming declarer guesses @d right|pg||
nt|werge: And a good game it is|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might play also dbl finesse in diamonds starting with J, not clear to play for Kx|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes but declarer plays @c first|pg||
nt|april7: should ruff a @C in dummy high before pulling trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: Let´s be straight: When North doubles 4 @H, he can´t let the opponents play 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|april7: he new it before that EW will go to 4@S, and wanted S to double if possible|pg||
nt|werge: N/S can agree upon on single point: THEY BOTH HAD A CLEARCUT DOUBLE over 4 @S|pg||
nt|werge: But a bad game anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And when playing @c towards the table, play low twice|pg||
nt|bobholl: duck it !|pg||
nt|yuval10: can play @d though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I think this will go down |pg||
nt|yuval10: south will switch to @d and declarer just doesn't have enough tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d, 4@c, 1@h at best|pg||
nt|meikever: For pictures of this match: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=57 all other information, results and articles: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|werge: Entame As de @c...|pg||
nt|meikever: the next match in 30 min is Netherlands Red U25 - Norway... see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for all the info|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be a bit ambitious|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 11 tricks and possible automatic squeeze|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it makes|pg||
nt|cindy: chance for redemption here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does that mean "a second chance to preempt"?|pg||
nt|cindy: he gonna feel like the goat if he goes down again|pg||
nt|ahalim: like i said, but that's DD|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a very good bid  2@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: it certainly is an area that needs to be discussed |pg||
nt|tomi2: opener took this 2@S as realy gameforcing and bid 3@H with the intention to make a forcing bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: on this lead easier now|pg||
nt|sybarra: no has to play the @H right |pg||
nt|sybarra: (again)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well predicted, Mike.|pg||
nt|othered1: tricky mighyt be an understatement but north can get two @D leads from dummy and get lucky|pg||
nt|voldenuit: this hand is beautiful with A1098 and J108 |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I like 2 nt even if it is invitational |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Losing Trick Count does not support an invitational call|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer imo will lose 3@h's and 2 aces for -2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very close with lots of chances for declarer to go wrong.|pg||
nt|santyclz: That may have been the 1st error.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: jasper did not know he had won |pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@D lead was reasonable however it should show N all they need to know...... since|pg||
nt|mariner1: another @D was not continues|pg||
nt|mariner1: continued|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it won't need even a squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that sure helps|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d , 3@s, 3@c, 2@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: always makes|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with better leads as @c or @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hobson'schoice|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: The problem with passing initially on hands like the East one is that the bidding may be  uncomfortably high when it gets back to you|pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 tricks here probably|pg||
nt|mrdct: will hook everything into north now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 50%|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S could falsecard with Q from Q10xx when clubs played 2nd round if owns D K|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mugsmate: Agressive 4S from Graham Robertson. Perhaps too many of his cards are under the opening bidder.|pg||
nt|cindy: dont lead a spade !!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Specs inform me that S is Paparo and W is Lorenzini|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way mind you|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: only double dummy :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, but the overcall makes it appear quirte clear how @h are distributed., so ducking one round should be fine.|pg||
nt|jujux: le 4 puis le 5 chez Fred?|pg||
nt|col3435: partner could have had more too :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tomi2: i have sympathy for making the "GF-bid" "strongly invitational" in this sequence, but I think you must discuss this with your partner. but then again if you have not discussed you ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should avoid 3@H "i hope thats forcing" and simply bid game with passed partner|pg||
nt|arthurking: non je pense pas|pg||
nt|santyclz: Also a lot of chances for the def to let it make.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Paske is not enjoying this|pg||
nt|col3435: give west a better spade suit (AJTxxx) and it's not such a bad place to be|pg||
nt|col3435: I can't work out why he would play the @dJ, what's going on there?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|400 volt: even with a @D more instead of a @H, 3 @D after 2 @S pass pass looks ok, doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ady: who is your money on?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *supply us|pg||
nt|yuval10: so it's 8:0 NET. now|pg||
nt|april7: careful with trumps|pg||
nt|april7: @C ace and @C!!!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|werge: 2 @C is a text-book bid with this hand - we cannot play 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can "we" handle all of this given @H start?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may go wrong here|pg||
nt|tomi2: Fisher tries to falsecard here, dont know if this is a good one|pg||
nt|yuval10: was better to play @d or @s now from East|pg||
nt|yuval10: in order to make declarer short|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be only 1 down may be|pg||
nt|april7: If he plays differently, might go down or must hope the @D finesse is on|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: S cant be a junior|pg||
nt|400 volt: but a nice defense, probably for down 1|pg||
nt|pelu: candidate for the Senior-team?|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to your comment,  thinking about whether I would introduce jxxx at the 3 level,   still thinking...|pg||
nt|othered1: now down|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't think they can beat it now|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think e needed to lead a low! @c!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: well if clubs run, there is some chance -- and it's a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if he han played low the first time ang got this @s return, he could have made it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is time enough to play @s to shorten deckarers trumph|pg||
nt|mariner1: N now|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel won 11 imps previous board|pg||
pc|cT|nt|werge: OK|pg||
nt|gips: down in 4, not in 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would he ever lead a spade?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: as a general principle, though, would you lead from the spade sequence or partner's bid suit?  |pg||
nt|ady: diamond discard by south bad|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Sure, and his diamonds could have been more useful than they've turned out. Still, perhaps a 2NT invite is better.|pg||
nt|yuval10: W found the very inspired lead of 7@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will prevail now|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: really making declarer work for this one and perhaps-1 now |pg||
nt|tomi2: imo @HJ increases the chances of a singleton king, because K5 and KJ are both same likely and you would always play the low one, but with J5 and in similar situatuions players tend ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to falsecard too often|pg||
nt|chick: I find its pretty rare for the multi opener to bid higher than 2N ... it's more of a problem in the 4th seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: half the point crammed into a doubleton, and the good trumps might be need to ruff clubs--can;t use them for two purposes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: @H and 5 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@d will give !n the needed clue to return @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d = i want @d, by their signals|pg||
nt|bobholl: should be now :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: needs @s now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but H is obvious|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: I think impossible  with trumps 4-0   can get back and forth to play diamonds without east getting a ruff  when diamonds thrown on wests hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@d from W in trick one was a clear @s indication|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now E must NOT return a dia, but W can tell him not to|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: no but for sure I would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: (I was not for bidding 3 @D with J942, but for 3 @D if you have one @H less and one @D more)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too !|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on the get go, |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: grrrrrrrrr  -2?|pg||
nt|tomi2: no luck for the schools team|pg||
nt|ady: cant get back|pg||
nt|othered1: right, down in 4, but they're in 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 3 nt brought back 10 imps|pg||
nt|raidouille: 3NT - 1 in OR so 10 imps for France|pg||
nt|bobholl: with my partners it had to be @D 2 roman with lav implications|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can make if he decide to finesse @h, but he went for @s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: in other words, before the opps can bid anything |pg||
nt|chick: at least when the hand belongs to the opps of the multi opener|pg||
nt|cindy: i couldnt answer that|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: can see 6 for the defenders|pg||
nt|ady: if south had kept an extra diamond  north could win this    cash 2 spades and exit with a club|pg||
nt|ady: cash 1 spade best    south might get squeezed|pg||
nt|mariner1: if S had kept the @D then would have pitched a @c so @c would be good|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then the @c9 would be the making trick.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: i don't really understand why E ignors it|pg||
nt|werge: Another example, that best lead is @H King!|pg||
nt|mrdct: might have tried to sneak a @D past the K |pg||
pc|d9|nt|santyclz: Death wish?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With this play it´s obvious that declares has @sAKx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: the spangenberg sisters would have done better :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gips: 10 tricks in 4 spade, 4 spade finishing to the dummy and @D, she has ace of clubs as entry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: N squoze his pd by cashing the @hs.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|werge: Partners suit - it might have been killing|pg||
nt|cindy: ok  well done   next|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: great shape to the hand,  even if its not so many points|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can discard the K@c over the J@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not that simple|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and on as Kx!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|werge: South is squeezed|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would still lead from the @s. East made a confident 3nt bid, and West let him in it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree- I always find that if you don't lead partner's suit, they think you are void  |pg||
nt|ady: not if he does not cash the last spade|pg||
nt|april7: only small @D to !Q might save the day|pg||
mc|8|nt|bobholl: claim|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I call it cooperating with declarer!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wouldn't have worked any longer|pg||

nt|sybarra: well Tim was right,  4 @S bd 3 not a great success|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 13 I mean |pg||
nt|othered1: We look to be playing well ahead of the open room|pg||
nt|ady: spec pointed out correctly    draw trumps ending in dummy  and play a diamond   and return to dummy with A@C  and diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general, methods that automatically get you to the three level on 8-card fits with invitationalk strength have an inherent flaw. this also applies to the standard method of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT-Forcing followed by a jump to 3 of opener's major|pg||
nt|voldenuit: easy board this one |pg||
nt|raidouille: with fatigue, no board is easy aymeric :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: England reached the slam in board 15 , too|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice match they're having so far|pg||
nt|arthurking: Vous auriez dis 2@h sur 1@s ?|pg||
nt|jujux: Ouaip|pg||
nt|yuval10: only when his parents aren't watching :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and one of them is|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're not here i think|pg||

nt|jcomyn: c well placed for thin h game|pg||
nt|april7: @C behave and  10 tricks in 4@H|pg||
nt|werge: Here E/W might lland a very lucky 4 @H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: played for throwin N having4234|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: there was a chance if @D Q was played and @C finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: But west didnt see it..|pg||
nt|meikever: For results, pictures, articles and everything you want to know: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our new operator is Tim Heeres, welcome to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: director at the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome Tim - any idea why?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let S win the 2 @c tricks and if S plays a @s he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a rather thin 4@h for NS here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice position of cards makes life very easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c probably majors|pg||
nt|yuval10: sort of Ekerens|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will minors win|pg||
nt|yuval10: 24 - another push, 3NT =|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but dad is watching on BBO|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is becoming serious for the dutch girls|pg||
mb|1N|an|10-12|nt|mdgraham: good luck!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Undo, operator.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a superior method IN 2/1 is to play a 2C response to 1M as EITHER A NATURAL 2/1 OR a 3-trump limit raise. that lets you out at the 2 level if you want|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now south has a problem, while holding both majors himself!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does X show|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: points i guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: it it's TO then i don't think it's a good one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well whats N to think|pg||
nt|bobholl: w will take him off the hook may be|pg||
nt|jcomyn: xx for me W|pg||
nt|jujux: Mais bon apparemment... c'est mieux de pas :)|pg||
nt|ady: at some earlier stage north needed to play ace and another club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice skam in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: How to avoid 450 here? Difficult|pg||
nt|werge: Another BIG hand - 6 @d|pg||
nt|werge: Agood and practical 6 @s - but nobody will bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like a Muiderberg bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes,  but that was the right reward for the bidding and declaring :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it went pass pass pass|pg||
nt|werge: But from where will the 9th trick come? Here it came from the @s-suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: your wish is my command :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: x 13-15 bal or 19+|pg||
nt|yuval10: does XX = i want to play 2@c ? or "p please chose your longer major" ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: N is bound to bid minor|pg||
nt|jcomyn: for me XX says let me at em|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way it looks like NS are heading into troubles|pg||
nt|werge: 6 D! will win...|pg||
nt|werge: @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will they get there|pg||
nt|aruf: hard to find 6@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: If they get there I will officially retire|pg||
nt|copeyj: Who wants to be in 6@D?|pg||
nt|werge: E/W..|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS likely in 3N here,,,, will be looking for 9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: so on board 6 (3@d) Hop played small @d to the ace, and lost @dk and @hQ for down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next macth in 35 minutes: Sweden vs Netherlands Blue|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will now|pg||
nt|davidb: 13 tricks ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if in 3NT with 22 this is possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: slam....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah sure who cares about singletons|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I understand these players all know each other well, |pg||
nt|baldfriede: There was a time when "forcing pass openings" were very fashionable in Germany, exchanging the meanings of "pass" and 1@c..|pg||
nt|le joker: 4@s or 4@h :)|pg||
nt|april7: W will give up on a trial bid by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: best to lead partner's suit, imho. If it is the killing lead, and you don't lead it, you never hear the end of it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Of course that could be a bluff ro make me lead anything but @h. :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: to*|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: that's what just happened Mike, Klug was not amused|pg||
nt|yuval10: because it looks very likely that north will compete with @d at least to the 3 level|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @D goes for only 200 i guess :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see I told ya|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmmm maybe even more :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: telephone number on the way it seems|pg||
nt|bobholl: thinks the double shows @C ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes what else|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What has happen here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: did the redouble show @C ??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: england heading for the hills|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This will be expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Jones looking worried|pg||
nt|jcomyn: VERY|pg||
nt|yuval10: he should be|pg||
nt|jcomyn: W can be seen licking her lips|pg||
nt|copeyj: well yes with Aq@D tight onside|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who was it said any slam which makes is a good one|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: oh, ok|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this 5-3 fit not so nice|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S to expensive, 4@H and 5 @C should work|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but now S will never believe N holds a singleton D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: markku - what about juniors and singletons in nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the U20's may be a bit intimidated by the older guys |pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not messing around here,  |pg||
nt|raidouille: 4@s old style|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld lead a @h with claire hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: they won;t let us play that over here (will spare you all the diatribe), but players elsewhere are encouraged to explore it|pg||
nt|voldenuit: east has to play trump then |pg||
nt|yuval10: North will pass now, and i believe South will reopen with X|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like 4@H can make here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c drury or natural?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@C is probably drury and not @Cs|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but who knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@H looks cold, only @S lead and @D back can make it difficult for declarer, but impossible for the defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky place for Ace of @D |pg||
nt|meikever: see pictures of this vugraph table on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|meikever: all information on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl ... results of the last round soon to come..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and of course it avoids all the sarcastic comments|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this immediate 4S response would be a popular choice if playing a strong club|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claire thinks east has 5 trumps that's why she leads a trumps with a singleton |pg||
nt|yuval10: wow|pg||
nt|copeyj: impressive restraint from Zepic|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D, first they need to find them at an appropriate level|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@SX could be 800 on best defence - 3@H 2@C 1@D|pg||
nt|werge: It´s now, West|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D|pg||
nt|jujux: Tom a du penser (à raison) qu il y avait bcp plus à perdre qu à gagner|pg||
nt|santyclz: Got to get those lead directors in.|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised not game try with @H bid by S |pg||
nt|yuval10: another 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: which i think S will bid now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4@S might be a little more difficult but probably makes too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: this is another point you need to discuss in case all bids are natural... 1@S forcing, 4sf nonforcing here...?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 1@C was 2+ but 1@H showed an unbalanced hand, operator?|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room already finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: unbal,@C+@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Mieke |pg||
nt|400 volt: I have to leave - See u all and much fun watching vuegraph :)|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|gips: 2@H is 7-10|pg||
nt|bobholl: who will bid the 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would have done it but is almost impossible to find.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: west will probably be glad to raise his partner to 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2@C = drury|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2.5 ?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: close call|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe 3@c ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is true. but even before that there were better approaches. win D ace, three trumps ending in dummy, club towards hand. hope E playes small. |pg||
nt|april7: bergen raises???|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who needs points - only grocers|pg||
nt|davidb: wow !  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: see thats what com,es of undiscipline|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy to miss 4@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Many teams in the German premier league played it.|pg||
nt|chick: we saw it played by one pair this past weekend|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even so, not really advised. you could miss a slam, especially if W ius short in clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh my god!!!|pg||
nt|arthurking: ta envoye en vitesse un texto a JCQ avec la main et la sequence lol ou juste parce que thomas a dit passe|pg||
nt|raidouille: bravo cédric|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  true marshall|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the end|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an obvious trumph lead from S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and he did|pg||
nt|ahalim: in fact you can make 12 tricks in @H's|pg||
nt|april7: even 6 possible, because of singleton @S known in N's hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: N now|pg||
nt|yuval10: North should, now|pg||
nt|meikever: the website of this tournament is: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - today's bulletin is online now|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder how quickly did W doubles?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I like W X |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Parvules here could be a lot weaker. I like 1NT the round before.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr  as they say |pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive x from W|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, 1NT from South, or even 2@c depending on what partner's opening shows|pg||
nt|col3435: is it even clear what this double means?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Felix |pg||
nt|yuval10: and does|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I saw her climb up on the table wave a flag and scream DOUBLE|pg||
nt|bobholl: i stopped counting on a @H lead |pg||
nt|copeyj: surely west owed his man game|pg||
nt|jujux: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where is this going?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to sit with E hand, and 2 @S did not occur to me|pg||
nt|le joker: 300, 5@d|pg||
nt|april7: inspired J of !J for 12 tricks!!|pg||
nt|april7: J of @C!!!|pg||
nt|ahalim: no need,establish @D's (3-3)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam bad contract but happens to make both reds 3-3|pg||
nt|april7: why, its agood slam|pg||
nt|mmmakela: opps bidding indicates they are not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: This will be a long way to 450...|pg||
nt|copeyj: AK and a 5 card suit could hardly have more|pg||
nt|copeyj: Zepic has done v well on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 2 @S not constructive?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 25 looks like a swing infavour of NET.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nt|pg||
nt|april7: but it won't help!:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no sorry he took it away|pg||
nt|werge: Wher you are given A-K in a suit...etc. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3h was preempt 4 ha maybe also??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with @cQ on side, you only have to ruff one @d on the table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: 7 tricks only, but an odd hand to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@C are becoming popular - were this pair playing transfer respones to an opening pass?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a bit of a thin one |pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 3 get a horrible death?|pg||
nt|werge: After that bidding, I would play the trumps from dummy...|pg||
nt|jujux: parceque tom a dit passe|pg||
nt|jujux: Non mais remarque que j'argumente|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of the playing area: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=57 (this match on the bottom)|pg||
nt|mugsmate: He didn't want to sell out to 2C.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: N wont think much of that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but may feel have defence to |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: South's hand has so much defense... Tough sacrifice to find|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4H|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: two @Ss @D and @C should set this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: i would be really surprised if they didn't bid this one, with S having a fit and all those controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S leads what now? |pg||
nt|bobholl: the law in optima forma :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont you love 4-2 fits at the 5-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: not specially :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: and vulnarable against not :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: where's David (Burn? or Bird? ) that will say that this is a violation of his rule?|pg||
nt|jujux: Allez mon ptit Fredo va falloir manier la cartoline :)|pg||
nt|arthurking: t'es en grande forme|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there is the 9th trick|pg||
nt|santyclz: And there it is.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: non vul side went very quietly here|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: unfortunate, but will probably be duplicated too|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@c could've been useful to help EW avoid of the game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very unfortunate s break though|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@c means strength in @c, West might get "cold feets" when he knows his singelton isn't well-placed|pg||
nt|april7: can you ruff more?|pg||
nt|ahalim: no it's not, @h must be 3-3|pg||
nt|davidb: new york times syndrom -looking for brilliancy prize !|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion N must bid 2@c to show a better hand than 1nt|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - the problem is NOY to bid 7...!|pg||
nt|yuval10: he needs a lot from P ... AQ@h, K@s , and it's still not enough for the contract to be 100 @h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: NOT|pg||
nt|werge: Even with the @S K on-side, it´s a long way to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: hearts 2-2    spade wrong    but 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is club obvious?|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Meike.|pg||
nt|ady: I said that before  and found the contract made|pg||
nt|mugsmate: This 3C bid is a symptom of the nervousness that pass followed by 2C hadn't done his hand justice.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of action on  a rubbish hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: all the hands are rubbish (imo)|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Actually if Parvelescu wanted to take another call over 2S, X probably said it best. Maximum (remember he can't have 4S or he'd have tried 1S last time)|pg||
nt|le joker: i agree|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and it is a phantom save if @d are 2-2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and is Thomas certain to drop HQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jujux: Je co-kibitz mes potes avec mon idole|pg||
nt|arthurking: ah il faut deviner ton idole...|pg||
nt|arthurking: quelle couleur jouer d abbord ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 3-3 fits dont seem to work too well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|voldenuit: nice switch @c |pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like E can be endplayed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can we get the magic 2000|pg||
nt|werge: I hate to tell you - but in the board with 7-card @S in South - West lead the @H 10 against 4 @S (PLAYED BY SOUTH...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well  the punishment fits the crime|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9@d i believe?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: good point|pg||
nt|werge: Everything under control|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He could have made a grand try by 5nt|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree -- it looks a bit lazy not to try to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if partner has @dKQxxxx its a good 7@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think south wasnt sure about the 6@D|pg||
nt|xenya: and he might well have that|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - even wutout the @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: without|pg||
nt|yuval10: they play 4@s by south|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: so it's 18:0 to Neth. now|pg||
nt|yuval10: more likely|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: well done to S |pg||
nt|yuval10: that when playing trumps, you need to have more trumps than your opps?|pg||
nt|yuval10: still time for defence to switch to @d and defeat the contract|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Jan says after the 2 aces, my dad should be watching now, He plays like this :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just finesse everything in sight|pg||
nt|sybarra: true, needs a lot of cover cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: 100%|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good(but unfortunate) stop, even 5 isn't clear to make just looking at your own assets|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: Now the way is even longer...|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D ruff?|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: I think so but not sure.  I was at the other table, so I didn't get to watch it directly.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We can't give you an accurate score I am sorry to say. We lost all data from the open room after the crash|pg||
nt|bobholl: 16 1/2/  tricks if 4@H makes 3@S goes down 3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @c position is good for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 8 was a horrible board for the Swedes. They conceded 800 in 4@SX|pg||
nt|yuval10: they also play 2@s as 6-9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: 10-11 i believe they bid 3@c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
mc|8|nt|mdgraham: wow, NS bid 7@D on board 2. well done them |pg||
nt|yuval10: we'll keep you updated, and thanks again to Rosaline Barendregt for supplying information from the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as the mikado sang|pg||

nt|werge: Good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: exactly what Verbeek notices|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need that imp?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Stuurman: we're not playing pairs|pg||
nt|pelu: smart guy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe showing off?  (says a spec)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: in the other room they opend east hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: rueful rabbit percentage play, i'll drop the K@H or the 8 will be good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed - werent they in Pau last year?|pg||
nt|yuval10: they both did, played in the schools team together|pg||

nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: good enough|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: slight overbid in the other room|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, South is a favorite to hold a @h stiff there|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: slight overbid in the other room|pg||
nt|cindy: ilike to play it over dbls as well|pg||
nt|santyclz: But xx and 2@s was.|pg||
nt|cindy: and also over 1H 1S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That depends how you take it. I mean to make game you only have to ruff one @d!|pg||
nt|april7: weak openers by S and W|pg||
nt|april7: who starts?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|tomi2: yeah, probably the TD came to the table and told them to be faster to avoid a penalty. then operator has no more chances to follow the game|pg||
nt|yuval10: great score for England here|pg||
nt|col3435: that didn't look right. if you're going to try to drop the @HJ, why not play the hearts before the spades? Then you can pick up QJx as well as QJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: as expected , Italy won 11 imps for the 6NT hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand was much too good for 2S the way most people play|pg||
nt|meikever: All info on: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl ... first stories about yesterdays hands now online|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good 4 hearts here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: some might bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: with E |pg||
nt|yuval10: North's sister, Ida, who is only 14 years old, also played in the same team, and did some very nice results|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is down 1 of course|pg||
nt|voldenuit: oui mais difficile de trouver les @s |pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........ next session is scheduled in 21|pg||
nt|mariner1: minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand to get to any winning bid here|pg||
nt|yuval10: E did a little bit too much i believe...his hand doesn't worth much after the X over 2@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@D is a junk multi bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 6@hs to me.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@h or 2@S is a better hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: they have 2@h/2@s for better pre-emptive|pg||
nt|yuval10: Dan you're sharp today :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: really? I'm feeling sleepy actually|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wheres this going|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: is north thinking?|pg||
nt|april7: 2@D? and then ppp|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: majors |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C =majors |pg||
nt|pelu: will they take the money? or just bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you sit for X of 2 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (with S hand) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: H canbe played right way up|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate hand of the session|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like a fast pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry no its east that things|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: east is the one with th ereal problem|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: ty vincent|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can she chance 3S?|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT makes too|pg||
nt|april7: EW in trouble|pg||
mb|p!|nt|werge: We alle would bid 2 §h|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe they play intermediate jumps this vul?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as pard knows you may have a dreg,  all is well |pg||
nt|sybarra: unfettered auction in the other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, it was west himself|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue what 3 @D is |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: its 50/50 after all|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d is multy as far as i know|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's really hard to defeat while playing from East|pg||
nt|bobholl: underlead in @H necessary|pg||
nt|yuval10: South needs to lead A@d and follow with another one....easier said than done|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS do play Michaels, i guess N decided not to use it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can she not?|pg||
nt|santyclz: After a xx showing 10ish?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: XX is OK when your suit is spades, but when it is hearts it is dangeorus|pg||
nt|cindy: why do that if you have drury ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S bids 3 H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N surely raises if 3 H strong|pg||
nt|april7: its not a weak jump so N should give him the 4th @H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but can it be that good?|pg||
mb|1N!|an|13-16 can have !S|nt|vugraphzjy: 3@d is Rubensohl|pg||
nt|sybarra: rube?|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the 1NT - do u like to open 1NT with that hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Thats what Geens told Stuurman|pg||
nt|raidouille: prefer pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or 5-5?|pg||
nt|bobholl: a weak two on 5 is not only for juniors or is it some "muiderberg"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2@h/@s would be good weak 2|pg||
nt|bobholl: minus 3 is a lot :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed seems strange|pg||
nt|bobholl: but down it will be|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, that would give East two spades for his 2@s bid. OK then.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and now west has a problem too|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: can't bid 3N without @h stopper (south's suit is probably @h) so maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 3 small H - hardly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well most people DON'T cindy|pg||
nt|werge: An AWFUL 2 @D!|pg||
nt|werge: 90 from OR is a very good result for the dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2 or 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Does´nt look like 9 easy tricks - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lose imps on this one also |pg||
nt|sybarra: good point Rob |pg||
nt|yuval10: and as MR. Cope note , 5@h is indeed a very cheap sacrifice, looks like -1 |pg||
nt|bobholl: and the mentioned underlead for another ruff|pg||
nt|werge: But best played from East|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't be a piker.  Make it your home page.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N NS plays well... only how many it makes is in question|pg||
nt|mariner1:  E has to pass,|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe better just to pass with those kind of hand and let P balance with 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: CR: 3 @S from North - not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it's their partnership Style...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont mind the 1 nt bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: it describes the hand, |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or possibly not a strong club framework... |pg||
nt|yuval10: East had the feeling that NS are "cheating on him"|pg||
nt|yuval10: in terms of bidding to game as sacrifice|pg||
nt|bobholl: they were :) kind of|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and is|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe didnt like his jxxxx suit?  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 11+5 game no problem|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe west should have bid 2NT|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this will also be a quick -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|yuval10: if she already bid 3NT.... then i really see no point in NOT bidding 2NT earlier|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: or if E bids 4@s now.. still probably same result|pg||
nt|jcomyn: even knowing the S 2D bid is hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder if N will lead p's suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: HA a certainty|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I have to leave a little early|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with @d lead.... this contract doesn't have much of a play|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok Dan, thx and see ya!|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: thanks everyone and enjoy the rest of the show!|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 7 only, but on @D lead 8|pg||
nt|tomi2: 14 hcp, offshape, Tx in spades, thats a modern 1NT opener, worked out well :)|pg||
nt|davidb: yesh running score ?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT tricky to bid now   3@H  ok   but who is going to bid 3NT    |pg||
nt|mugsmate: 4H should imply spade tolerance here (no weak 2 opener)|pg||
nt|mugsmate: But 4S is Ok too|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would michaels the hand myself|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2nt-3nt now?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: chance here for norway|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: pass looks better than 4@S albeit the fact that we're bidding a vul game|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: minimum, soft values|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Dan.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cheers|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those who don't play drury in comp.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nicely found 2 @C in OR|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop in the open room . I like the accuracy (specially NV)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well 24 more than enough for these lads|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: and now big problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  does E have  @H in with his @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2?|pg||
nt|sybarra: can 4 nt even be to play?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: me too but in 2nd with 7cards Major that's not bad |pg||
nt|jcomyn: spose E expects SA to be with N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone translate that|pg||
nt|othered1: big @C, positive in @H, acceptance, autosplinter?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@C strong, 1@s gf with 5+@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H agrees trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: spl|pg||
nt|copeyj: ed beat me to it :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: someone explain that to me|pg||
nt|davidb: very good for both NS to play Part Score with 24 HCP|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: they will reach 3N here -- can it be made?|pg||
nt|werge: West (also) holds Easts pass over 5 @C inviting|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, not so easy to see 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: kids you are killing me  :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3nt does not make though|pg||
nt|chick: if they are playing Polish Club system, it's a sometimes-strong club framework :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not pla Ps suit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he tries to ruff a @C in S it will be dramatic :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are running late here. Next match scheduled to start in 18 minutes, and they still have one board after this|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise 5@S 2@C a@D and some placing for 1 down :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think declarer will play AK@c , W will ruff and plays @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: TD at the table yet, Dennis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no|pg||
nt|yuval10: very wd by NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: true a great result for england|pg||
nt|ady: south 3@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Joe did you did up your  404 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no one, but 5@D looks playable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Problem with 3@s is it might be thought a cue for @ds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: game before slam, when you agree a minor you don't need to show Cue bids at the 3 lvl, you have a level and a half fror that, they tend to just show "'values"' on the hunt for the ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: usual 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds willbe assisted by a spade lead   otherwise some views    only 3 top tricks outside    needs 8 trump tricks  or extra s from clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 NT maker|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: hard for W to pass|pg||
nt|werge: On the @d-lead, you make two @C-tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|april7: but not the worst idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: but in the other room, there was no @H overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yup|pg||
nt|tomi2: only needed: spade lead, no @H switch, spades 2-6 with @DK onsinde or with the 2 spades AND @HA|pg||
nt|davidb: N opened 1Nt in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i dont think south has any nails left after this match|pg||
nt|meikever: Next round in 50 min Norway - Poland U25.. complete vugraph schedule U25: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=60&Itemid=56|pg||
nt|meikever: today i meant :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Meike as always |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, of course. |pg||
nt|yuval10: 12 imps back for England|pg||
nt|aruf: hi all |pg||
nt|jcomyn: they dont believe in defending do they|pg||
nt|werge: This should bring the home team 5-7 IMP´s|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong prediction again|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT with a minor-lead can make|pg||
nt|yuval10: great players sometimes measured by how they capitalize from a very bad board|pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting |pg||
nt|werge: Cherce - et tu va trouver|pg||
nt|werge: cherche|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would be a system violation for me.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: even 3 migh go down here on bad guessing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, joe i thought you meant that both 2S & RD were available, now i see what you meant|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: can this be to play??|pg||
nt|meikever: Next round in 25 min will be Germany - Denmark|pg||
nt|gips: 2@C gazzilli, 2@D 8+. 2@S nat with @C|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@d 1@c 1@s 1@h |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: west didn't realize it was his turn|pg||
nt|col3435: North's bidding worries me - he seems to like taking the last guess a bit too often.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we sed a 5 @S bid? |pg||
nt|sybarra: *see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont be surprised what we see|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow undoubled |pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe South was thinking whether to X or not, and do very well not to X|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't have a double vs 5@d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Declarer was lucky to only be -1 in the OR|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only 8 so must play on clubs now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: Now they probably get a @S-lead instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: chewing on them?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yea|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: started with that @hk|pg||
nt|werge: But what is the idea with 2 @D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably artificial, FG checkback|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make with a correct play|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can't really go wrong in 5@d, he can ruff 3@c's, he can finesse @c, @h.... all works|pg||
nt|santyclz: I agree, Rob.  It's just I try to avoid ambiguous bids whenever I have an alternative.|pg||
nt|col3435: as on bd 6|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match on: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats a nice lead |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: didnt think S could pass,  bid=insurance|pg||
nt|werge: Merry Christmas now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know exactly why South knew that North has @D's too..|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh  over our heads|pg||
nt|sybarra: or their heads|pg||
nt|pelu: can u tell me about 3@D?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 26 was flat also|pg||
nt|werge: Good position, that the @H-suit has been kept out of the bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: this board won't be flat, that's for sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all over now|pg||
nt|werge: 9 easy tricks now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: May be they will rtop in 4 @d, friendly warned by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South, sorry maybe, I have to much confidence in west maybe|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but back to what?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, looks like some kind of checkback.|pg||
nt|ady: good pass    anythin higher  lead to a minus|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS deserve much credit for doing so here, after such a disaster in the previous one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now it´s easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: i do not like 4@D at all - KJT@C is one of the worst holdings you could look for opp spl|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to stop here|pg||
nt|ady: yes   can get the long clubs good|pg||
nt|santyclz: But yes, you're right.  It's much riskier if your suit is @hs.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do we know what the XX by N was?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: NOW AT LEAST 2 DOWN|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't see more than 8 tricks even double dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W must play @dK either a @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why is it 2 down? It may even make|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s is more likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: if W returns @h it can indeed be make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: low diamond return and he can make it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @DK is OK but how can she know that?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E had played partners suit, there had been no problem|pg||
nt|yuval10: i see 9 tricks with @s return, as declaer will ruff-finesse @c and lose 1@c and 2@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's for sure if he leads a @H they migth make even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-0 break a bit cruel but then he who lives etc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to know why u would guess right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: made in open, but I don't know how, must be a present by defence|pg||
nt|werge: Say you accept to loose 2 @C-tricks and the red Aces = 600 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry, passing on 3@C was probably better West said|pg||
nt|april7: that is a way to make it|pg||
nt|werge: stop|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I only play it myself, sometimes, so it's easy to forget |pg||
nt|bobholl: now correct play not necessary any more|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, that'd be 15 for England|pg||
nt|yuval10: they will, after both deny @s control|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead will most probably be @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: lots of ways that work to make 5@D........ hard to go off yet is possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: after the lead...always -2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: at least he can not misguess @H here :)|pg||
nt|mugsmate: 3 off I think if everyone does as they should.|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes and more misery to the girls|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: checking for a spade fit|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead best for defence|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claim time :) |pg||
nt|cindy: no we dont|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: it certainly doesnt look like a rubesohl bid to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops one too high,  needed pass card at 4 nt maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3@d shows @h stopper, asks @s stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: says east|pg||
nt|ady: tricky switch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If nonvul i would always open the E hand. vul is another story. 1st vs. 2nd position in my view is in general a rather overrated factor. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now it can make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: spade finesse, @DA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely E denied that card when did noit lead a D|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer should know that finesse @s works, hench the X by East|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe it was obligatory|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 8@h|pg||
nt|april7: asking for a @C lead!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: oh  |pg||
nt|sybarra: so why didnt W just bid 3 nt?|pg||
nt|bobholl: is a nv vuln double gameswing that many ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's always great to bounce back from a disaster with a double-game swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1100|pg||
nt|bobholl: i am not used to it so don't know without a scorecard|pg||
nt|yuval10: i've paid so many 1100 in my life that i know it already :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep 15|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
nt|werge: Claim|pg||
nt|yuval10: ot yet... might make 4|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they play @h and @h back|pg||
nt|yuval10: which make a 1 imp difference|pg||
nt|yuval10: never good to claim prematurely :)|pg||
nt|werge: It seems, that no lead and no defence can defeate 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: - but a @D-lead|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.elsid.co.za/bridge/templates/vpscale.html|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: Best to be said for N/S: It is rather cheap|pg||
nt|bobholl: well i am 61 years old playing bridge for 40 years and still don't know|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that took care of the s suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: some more good news for NET. - board 27 Norway missed the easy 4@s|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe it showed four hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so ideally one should play different methods over X depending on which major we have opened. but most players want a uniform treatment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cindy a spec has confirmed your conjecture|pg||
nt|cindy: ideally a partnership should play the best methods...whether uniform or not|pg||
nt|april7: claim time|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: I am confused|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: because he didn't understand it like that i suppose|pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 crds seen it is so easy :) see|pg||
nt|santyclz: When I make a wild jump systemicly pd is required to have hx or xxx in my suit.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Now a spade to set up the overruff is easiest.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: Otherwise there is a small risk that declarer does something Godlike in trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: N/S =silver medalists from BEIJING|pg||
nt|ahalim: imp to vp scale|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: next match is Sweden- Croatia and after that, a very interesting match between France U-25 and Poland U-25|pg||
nt|mariner1: double set swing on 18 gave us a new leader|pg||
nt|ady: I agree   but would be reluctant to take any outside finesses with 2 spades off     the clubs can be established   there are enough entried|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s by W|pg||
nt|yuval10: so more imps are going Netherland's way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He gave up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If declarer will finess in @h, defence can find their 5 club tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|werge: The spped proves, that East will make this...|pg||
nt|werge: speed|pg||
nt|sybarra: something obviously got tangled up in the translation here.... |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ideally one should play different systems in each position and each vulnerability, but...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjy: Jan is trying to claim 1down|pg||
nt|werge: Somebody ought stop the board now...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: seems like that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it is against my religion to go for 1100 so I didnt know either I looked it up|pg||
nt|yuval10: now all of declarer's problem were solved|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the switch solves the problems, draw trumps and claim with a @H ruff now|pg||
nt|yuval10: can just cash trumps and claim|pg||
nt|yuval10: they need the victory to stay in the top-4 hunt|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: the defence is easy :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade back and a diamond switch  and 3 rd spade makes like awkward|pg||
nt|raidouille: claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: Joe lives in a fantasy land with partners who are footed in reality|pg||
nt|werge: Anyway - this was 11 IMP instead of 10|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but to norway not netherlands|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like the score now is actually 24:11|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: life|pg||
nt|gips: nice|pg||
nt|gips: now must guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    making life very difficult|pg||
nt|april7: right, should have passed 3 @C|pg||
nt|werge: Undo - or so|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gips: guessed|pg||
nt|yuval10: -2 now|pg||
nt|mugsmate: One way or another, Robertson will score a trump trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: next hand last, so an early thank you to our brilant operator Sandie Millership  great job!|pg||
nt|sybarra: *brilliant|pg||
nt|xenya: unless W returns a @D now|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Vlad :) |pg||
nt|mugsmate: right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the raise to 4 @S, not sure W has the count |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's logical and obvious to play @s from South after the @h ruff, but why not make it easy to partner with signals?|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will be pleasantly surprised.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: great chance to see one of the world's best players, Thomas Bessis, in action|pg||
pc|h5|nt|werge: To make 11, you must transfer the @C-guard and squeeze North in the black suits|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze rouge|pg||
nt|arthurking: 1 pour la pologne|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|werge: Now he might make it!|pg||
nt|xenya: then declarer has 2 entries to finesse trumps twice|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely done Paske|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually almost all partnerships have different agreements depending on position and colors, but they are more in the realm of treatments and style than actual system differences|pg||
nt|santyclz: That comment generated far too many responses for me to address, sry.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nice pairs result 3 NT 11!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|ady: guessed |pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: quick death |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: @D now - and @H King|pg||
nt|marlowepi: joe it's easy, just make one announcement telling them all that they are wrong :)|pg||
nt|cindy: haha|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, most of them are right.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last board coming up soon|pg||
mc|7|nt|dan_ehh: now Thomas will have to find the @C|pg||

nt|mariner1: all the generous sponsors and organizers for for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|werge: East must have partnered North in OR - how else can you let N/S play on the 3-level?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|werge: 6 @H lay-down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the only clue there might be that would East go up @HQ on the first round with AQx |pg||
nt|yuval10: 17 against 7, indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Rob Myers (England), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||

nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: unfortunately it's more fun than watching my team play :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our (unamed) operator,  great job |pg||

nt|santyclz: What does one need for a 2@s bid?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 2H is suicide vul|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = negative free bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Christophe's father wishes to congratulate him for holding this excellent E hand|pg||
nt|cindy: and many would double with W hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT openings make it hard to find minor-suit games and slams, so with a slam-friendly hand like this S is right toi open 1D|pg||

nt|bobholl: too good for 1nt ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: s did well - i would not have doubled here - not a good 12 count|pg||
nt|arthurking: oui ils ont ete impressionnant depuis le debut|pg||
nt|mariner1: last but definitely not least, thanks to all our spectators, their tips and comments|pg||
nt|mariner1: help! & defenestrate Santyclz :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I find it strange that a language has a verb for "to throw someone out the window."|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is the spot as in Open, can they find it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so says a fictional being?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is infrangible even with a @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: and we have this board and board 28 to compare|pg||
nt|yuval10: the connection between the room has lost|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's why we see no updates|pg||
nt|santyclz: He has the big casino and beer card.  Great hand.|pg||
nt|april7: come on Hans!|pg||
nt|yuval10: what's going on?|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Now Big Brother is watching us... - welcome Wald|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he did!|pg||
nt|werge: Seems difficult - loosing 2 !- and 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i think so yes... hope i can get coffee|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Mieke our terrific web-mistress |pg||
nt|sybarra: Rob Myers, UK |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but W should bid again|pg||
nt|yuval10: not much reason to do so, honestly|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if @H K in E ??|pg||
nt|yuval10: 12 vs 10|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the White House Juniors 2009, the NBB (Kees Tammens) and|pg||
nt|mariner1: all the generous sponsors and organizers for for helping BBO bring us the|pg||
nt|mariner1: vugraphs!|pg||
nt|yuval10: Thx Shirley|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure was tx all|pg||
nt|baardolav: rd now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah.  Neg free bids, sry.|pg||
nt|werge: RD|pg||
nt|meikever: Pictures of this match: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially brilliant operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: missclick here Dirk?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: comic Nt i suggest|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Sorry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|april7: will reach 3NT but will probably go down because of no entry to the @h suit in W|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @c|pg||
nt|pelu: I like that 3@D for the lead - even if it can cost in Red|pg||
nt|raidouille: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: north charging to the rescue as it were|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is just counting HCP|pg||
nt|yuval10: might be the case|pg||
nt|sybarra: exciting set of bds!|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess they don't play support XX in those situations|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he was blushing and I put him off|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: so is E|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 2@s too |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Marshall, Aymeric, Cindy and Landry |pg||
nt|raidouille: I wld bid 2@s |pg||
nt|baardolav: no 1sp is supp|pg||
nt|jcomyn: x everything that moves|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats that bye all and tx|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks John, bye.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at MPs, 2NT is fine with the S hand. for example, here S would probably make a trick more in 3NT than N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but he is missing the curse of scotland|pg||
nt|mildredb: wrong sided it - provided @S lead|pg||
nt|april7: now NS is in trouble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E bid 2 @H no?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no he passed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzjy: East is relaying,|pg||
nt|werge: There might be an entry, if you play a small @d first|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like it also |pg||
nt|gips: mmmm|pg||
nt|ady: club lead     kill the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades ok      this will be difficult on a club lead    but very lucky heart position may still be ok |pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Joe Shair (USA), David|pg||
nt|mariner1: Edwin (Great Britain), Yuval Yener (Israel), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx we sound like a multi-national law firm |pg||
nt|mugsmate: Very tough for Stafie to bid over 3H. He has the values to X, but can't do so with such a measly spade holding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: She!!|pg||
nt|mugsmate: So a nervous pass his only real option.|pg||
nt|mugsmate: her - sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're going to have one more excitement , i believe|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h is down 1|pg||
nt|werge: Are they allowed to double?|pg||
nt|werge: They are...|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW looks like they're not on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems so - at long last|pg||
nt|april7: now 3@H!!!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gips: brava|pg||
nt|ady: chance of swing wither way here|pg||
nt|ady: either|pg||
nt|gips: but now he must play on that spot of @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. i agree with aymeric that W could try 4S over 2S, but at least an invitational call is certainly warranted|pg||
nt|yuval10: same lead as CR|pg||
nt|bobholl: made now @H lead indicate|pg||
nt|yuval10: or rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR|pg||
nt|arthurking: je dirais meme la meilleure paire suivis de tout pres par fred et tom loin devant nous|pg||
nt|sybarra: and never a dull moment at this table |pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess West meant X to be @h's|pg||
nt|werge: 9 easy tricke against 2 @D D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes double shows @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont disappoint us|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: we are experiecing some connection trouble from amsterdam it seems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed crashing all day|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: not I   bid 3S the first time and be done with it|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|werge: No comments...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|voldenuit: I have 10@s the king of h and a sing @d I don't want north bid in @d |pg||
nt|raidouille: 10 trumps , bid 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with everybody--heavy for 2S and light for 3S. but it is much closer to 3S in my view|pg||
nt|raidouille: trump law|pg||
nt|jujux: Vous êtes une paire plus récente, surement un peu plus de tps de "rodage" nécessaire|pg||
nt|jujux: On a confiance ;)|pg||
nt|arthurking: Oui on pas si mal joué depuis le debut mais on a souvent un mauvais coup en dix donnes, independemment des bons et des autres coups|pg||
nt|arthurking: mais cricri et cedrix : impressionnant vraiment !|pg||
nt|santyclz: He's slacking off.  The most we've had is 12 concurrent vg tables in the last week.|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like Norway will pick up some 7 or 8 imps in the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match today in 10 mins or so is Netherlands Blue vs Italy|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably 16:14 in VP's|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hooray a penalty x|pg||
nt|yuval10: another violation of the David Burn rule.....|pg||
nt|werge: 100,300,500,800 etc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will see blood spilled|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: Strange result from OR!|pg||
nt|werge: We should be able to guess the bidding in OR: 1 @d - 1 H - @C -all pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is the last this session and looks like a flat boars. Thanks all. Now I shall play a match in our league, so bye for now|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye Ralf|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  has a chance    but Norway will get a nice swsintg playing in  1NT|pg||
nt|april7: big trouble|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they got points all right but no source of tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Belgium again to high|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the 3 @D call was important here |pg||
nt|baardolav: Simonsen should play the J now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: http://www.elsid.co.za/bridge/templates/vpscale.html  -  WBF IMP - VP Conversion|pg||
nt|mariner1: Scale|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3N shouldn't be a big problem here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: At least 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: Sorry, discard of one !-trick on @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: flat board|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: its ok to play sometimes at the "below game" level  think we have done that only once this set here|pg||
nt|werge: Between friends it might be only 500|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjy: aah that seems more normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! and I cannor see why W didn´t bid 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: A little, yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: no finess now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s is a little bit "out of the blue", but it might make nontheless|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 2x |pg||
nt|ahalim: @H lead or good @C guess for 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @C first ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good effort by NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: 4@H actually the best contract,5@C difficult to play especialy on @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East did well to make seven tricks next door|pg||
nt|raidouille: sure Marshall|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL scared them away|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: After 4 @D from East, the problem must be to avoid the grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite frankly, I don't think n had any rights there.  His pd was not a passed hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (e i mean)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so should be off in 4@C instead of making 3N|pg||
nt|april7: France will lose the lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: but W never showed a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West showed 3@S-4@H-1@D-5@C, minimum and 0 kc, he showed wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open East was decl -|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: shouldnt east realise Kx @d wasnt worth much|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we'll see|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East asked only|pg||
nt|chick: N has lots of work to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certaionly W could bid game when E bids again voluntarily. innumerable missed opportunities here|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds first because w is the threat hand.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: Now the strange resylt from OR was changed|pg||
nt|cindy: problem is both of them were conservative|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially when all the suits are breaking so nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last 1 ty all! Feel sorry for the girls, didn't deserve 46-0|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|baardolav: beit gårn no|pg||
nt|chick: he can't afford to throw anything except a small heart .. can he figure it out?|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board anyway, thanks all! looks like another convincing win for Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz: E, I mean.|pg||
nt|yuval10: they do know how to play bridge... luckily we can't say the same about Tennis :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|meikever: for pictures of this match, results, articles and info: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he started them, he of course continued them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: she|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, sorry :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
nt|ady: clear clubs best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: right, "ova" is a female ending for Czech names|pg||
nt|ady: now impossible to make|pg||
nt|copeyj: must rise A here|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|arthurking: ah va gagner now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cindy: either invite conservatively or accept conservatively   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: or a pop group called Jon John David Vlad and Shirley|pg||
nt|davidb: E  should do more with his hand .partner has bid free 1NT (8-11)|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice def. from EW|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: happens |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we will resume in 5 min.. |pg||
nt|sybarra: will get coffee then |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we will restart any moment now|pg||
nt|bobholl: we still have gerbrand (jacco's brother) as operator ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: good one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: bad connection :(|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and we are back again|pg||
