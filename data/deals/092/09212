nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||

mb|4N|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
mb|5S|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||

nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||

nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||

nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||

pc|sK|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||

nt|frankaus: the anti-discrimination people will get me but...... i'm not fond of minors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: minor slams pay bonus in imps  that far outweigh the bonus in non-imps for 3N|pg||

nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||

nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||

nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||

pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||

nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||

nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||

pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||

nt|james_h: Peter Goodman suggests 5nt to show the 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|viren169: problem either min is best on this bidding seq...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cindy: next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|cindy: well, striking gold|pg||
nt|viren169: now a flat board...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ciaran: Usually don't show voids in partner's first is suit thoug, so may expect void in a minor?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: that diamond switch concedes an additional IMP|pg||
nt|ciaran: first bid suit|pg||

pc|s8|nt|cindy: no ?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S played well for most part... but lost it on the last few boards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the mathematics of the situation favor a penalty double with the E hand, but clearly the mathesonics do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: sorry 2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||

nt|paulg: broadcast|pg||
nt|paulg: Also all of my fellow commentators and all the kibitzers who have helped|pg||
nt|paulg: Next segment starts at 2155 GMT, or in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when the double you in 1nt, run (Martin's law)|pg||
nt|cindy: who is Martin ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the immigration officer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mart's in-law?|pg||
nt|cindy: oh its you    you said it like it was someone else|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another big chance|pg||
nt|james_h: Its a great debut for Terry and Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: This looks about a 50/50 slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes DK and SA out|pg||
nt|viren169: last one now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i play weak no trump sometimes|pg||
nt|jferg: do you have a rescue agreed when x|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

pc|cK|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
pc|c6|nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
