mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Seems that declarer can avoid the club guess (in 5@H) by developing the diamonds. If North ducks the first round, you can afford to lose a club.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|athene: well-judged by Gold-Townsend in the other room over the predictable "we have spades and we aren't vulnerable" intervention|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|athene: south should have raised spades first time though - that would make things harder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still 4@S is not particularly cheap. East will surely double when North bids 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting choice by east - if you aren't going to show a good 3-card heart raise, 2@D looks more obvious than double|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea is he is intending to play in hearts anyway, and so doesn't really want to emphasise diamonds over clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems to be right now on the North cards. Why not?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@D has me mystified.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Michaels, showing a hand of possibly moderate strength that is at least 5-5 in the majors. |pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: to be fair, 1@C isn't really clubs these days, just a general expression of enthusiasm|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don;t see that East could 'come again' when he had already bid more on the previous round than his England counterpart.|pg||
mc|12|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Steve Eginton and to Bill Frisby, my fellow commentator!|pg||
nt|athene: i think the underlying issue here is how good a hand 4@D promised|pg||
nt|brolucius: Steve is a great operator and always chips in with some good comments.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: I'll close when the other room is finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: THanks David - very kind|pg||
nt|athene: when you have the opportunity to make a cheap control-bid (one which doesn't raise the level of the contract higher than you are already committed to) - does that show extras?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D means that a slam is possible, that's all. Maybe you are right and that does mean that East can make one more try.|pg||
nt|athene: if partner is unlimited and you are limited, clearly, you have to cue|pg||
nt|athene: if partner is very limited then clearly you don't have to if you know there can be no slam|pg||
nt|athene: but in all the 90% of cases where neither partner is "all that much" limited, it's hard|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i mean "not all that much limited"|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: Oxford, home of dreaming spires and exciting 7@C contracts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Will East risk a re-opening double with a void spade?|pg||
nt|athene: as usual, slams and grand slams based on key voids are very difficult to bid|pg||
nt|athene: here, there are TWO critical voids|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: or maybe 1Sx contracts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No way that North is thinking of making a contribution.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Maybe a simple 5@C from West.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: 3@D?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or 2@S first, to show that he had a penalty pass.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: the problem with 2@S is, it's not at all clear if it's forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: or maybe 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: He might have bid 4@D, splinter. That would have excited East.|pg||
nt|athene: couldn't west just have something like a 3@S opener and want to bid a non-forcing 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: possible it would be exclusion?|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he had no aces outside and partner had rebid only 2@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I certainly don't agree that 2@S should be natural.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|brolucius: Surely not 5@D by North now, on that Q-high hand. Well, he has bid it. Dangerous.|pg||
nt|athene: cool! the auction has taken wing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: suddenly the 2C rebidders making a GS try!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D helps East, who can place West with shortage.|pg||
nt|athene: the music will stop in 6@C now i guess - 7@C has no obvious losers but i think you can't come to 13 winners, can you?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not Selway's finest moment, as I see it.|pg||
nt|athene: i mean unless south does something rash, like lead the wrong ace|pg||
nt|athene: but on this auction, south knows west has a trap of spades, so the @SA would be a rather mad choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D figured to go for 300/500 against a NV game. It had little going for it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South should not be tempted to bid 6@D, I would have thought, because he knows of the spade stack.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: erichsen is considering 6@D, i am sure, rather than doubling|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: anyone who is tempted to double with A A should read "why you lose at bridge" by SJ Simon|pg||
