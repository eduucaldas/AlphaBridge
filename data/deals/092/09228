mb|1S|mb|p|nt|finch: Declarer made 4@S in the other room by taking the double spade finesse|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|finch: with no diamond lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|finch: on the @DQ lead and a diamond ruff (if West overtakes), I think declarer is likely to go off|pg||
nt|mwigor: @d lead not enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: not easy even on H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: i see sorry - playing EW for Hx or Hxx|pg||
nt|mwigor: or HHx for that matter|pg||
nt|finch: after diamond, diamond, diamond ruff, declarer has to decide whether to play East for Hx or for xx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mwigor: but then you have a guess on the 2nd round of trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|finch: The guess is on the first round of trumps|pg||
nt|mwigor: on this hand yes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yep|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|finch: as they are only in 3@S, there is a little less interest in the play here|pg||
nt|mwigor: but if after a @d ruff you played the Ace and east played an honour you would have to decide to play for restricted choice or not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|finch: in four on a diamond lead you may well decide to play for West to have QJx, as a singleton lead is unlikely from Qx of trumps|pg||

mb|1H|nt|finch: We've found an auction where Robson/Allfrey don't play transfers over interference|pg||

nt|finch: Allfrey's 1@D opening is usually 5+ cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p!|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|finch: the pass over 1@S likely to deny 3 hearts (or at least to deny an opening bid with 3 hearts)|pg||

nt|mwigor: i prefer the 1@h overcall in the other room|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|finch: One big problem with 1NT the first time is that the hand is really too good|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: That's messed up Andrew's switch to @S9 :(|pg||
nt|finch: xx xxxx xx Jxxxx just needs hearts 2-2 and the club finesse to make game|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: and this @S unmessed it |pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: except the 4th spade has gone walkabout :)|pg||
nt|finch: going back a bit, this is why I think it's better to start with the @CQ rather than @CA as you retain control of the suit|pg||
nt|finch: it takes huge defence to beat it from here|pg||
nt|mwigor: robson needs to win this @s (or play @s9) otherwise they cant get the @d suit going|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|finch: 3@C a very gentle call from North.  he would like to bid something as good club raise, but may not have anything available|pg||

nt|garnetts: Lets get this one out of the way--3@H is horrendous |pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|finch: This looks to have four losers unless something goes awry in the defence|pg||
nt|mwigor: the 3@d bid made it quite likely that he would buy a suitable dummy|pg||

nt|sharkirl: D continue|pg||
nt|eamongall: should'nt go awry but I saw some hands in the recent past where all tricks were not collected |pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: ruffing squeeze chance?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|mwigor: he gets to 9 tricks fairly easily on xruff line - but the 10th is problematic|pg||
nt|finch: Robson quite aggressive, partner's shape is quite likely as with 4 spades he would have raised, not doubled|pg||
pc|d3|nt|finch: but move dummy's @CQ into the spade suit, and 4@H is huge (as is 4@S)|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes 3h reasonable|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H would have shown nothing|pg||
nt|james_h: then pass is the bid|pg||
nt|finch: it is a little deep defending 3@Dx on the west cards. He has to guess between 3@H and 4@H knowing he is opposite|pg||
nt|mwigor: i like robson's 4@h bid - they give you a big bonus if you succeed in making 10 tricks in a Major|pg||
nt|finch: ...a 3415 (or possibly 3406) with extra values|pg||
nt|sharkirl: i still think very aggressive|pg||
nt|finch: I think game is likely to be anti-percentage, but as Michael says there is a game bonus.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|finch: Robson has made a living being very aggressive|pg||
nt|mwigor: i only need to make it 37.5% of the time to break even|pg||
nt|james_h: 500 is almost game|pg||
nt|finch: sometimes you get doubled, Michael|pg||
nt|mwigor: 500 is very unlikely opposite a partner who could X twice|pg||
nt|finch: although on the evidence on an earlier board this set, less often than you might expect|pg||
nt|james_h: so is Allfreys double not right?|pg||
nt|finch: james is suggesting +500 out of 3@Dx|pg||
nt|mwigor: allfrey was minimum for his 2nd X in my view|pg||
nt|mwigor: but its right with all those aces|pg||
nt|james_h: All Allfrey needs is the @cA and 2 entries|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but they Dbl with shape,not always very strong|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he doubled twice|pg||
nt|mwigor: the first double could be based just on shape|pg||
nt|mwigor: the 2nd double showed a good hand surely|pg||
nt|sharkirl: see dbl of 4s earlier|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Good morning all.|pg||
nt|mwigor: he only doubled once|pg||
nt|finch: Robson is trying to find a layout on which 4@H makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: should have been punished!!|pg||
nt|mwigor: quite reasonable to reopen with a double when holding a singleton or void in the overcall suit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|eamongall: good morning Rory |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mwigor: sometimes you get burnt - but passing risks missing out on the party when partner had a trap pass|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|golfsquash: The bottom line here is overbidding, turning +500 into close to -500.|pg||
nt|mwigor: in a recent tournament on the gold coast i held a 21 count with AQJ9x of the jump overcall suit (and i am still waiting for the reopening double)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|mwigor: sorry i'm still failing to see how this is ever worse than -100|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|finch: he worked out there was bascially no trump layout where he could draw trumps, because even KQ doubleton doesn't help|pg||
nt|mwigor: defence need to be careful now after @d ruff @c|pg||
nt|finch: this way I think he's hoping that whoever wins a trump trick at the relevant point will be unable to cash a spade, and a ruff discard will give it|pg||
nt|finch: yes after diamond ruffed, club, South needs to not ruff|pg||
nt|finch: I think|pg||
nt|finch: he can't quite do it whatever he does|pg||
nt|finch: I haven't yet worked out a layout on which this is making, but it's a good exercise to look for one|pg||
nt|finch: you can't just give up|pg||
nt|finch: and sometimes the defence go wrong|pg||
nt|mwigor: if north had @h10 it would be ok wouldnt it?|pg||
nt|finch: possibly if South had shorter clubs and North had the @H10 they would be better off|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|finch: even after a diamond ruff, when it looks as if the @H10 will make a trick by force, declarer may be able to pick|pg||

nt|vugraphzkh: we've got 30 minutes left|pg||
nt|mwigor: around 2 hours is normal without screens|pg||

nt|eamongall: I think Camrose went to screens recently |pg||
nt|finch: Not sure about 4@D.  If it's a cue bid the 4@H bid is a bit odd. Perhaps it was exclusion RKCB.|pg||
nt|mwigor: finally someone claims declarership at the 4-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: ah, we've been told.  3@H was a splinter somewhere, and 4@D said it was in diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|finch: it's more of a picnic after a trump lead, likely to make 11 now|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably they are able to show void splinters in a different way|pg||
nt|eamongall: 3 years ago former Camrose Green jacket winner Mr Pigot indicates |pg||
nt|finch: but with both black suits 3-2 I think this was always pretty safe|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||

nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|an|No major|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|finch: 1@S from Allfrey may show clubs here (although it hasn't been alerted)|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s looks like a transfer to 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: OK, showed clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|finch: double would be 4+ hearts, 1@H 4+ spades|pg||
nt|mwigor: (it looks like) EW play X there = @h and 1@h = @s - a method which is growing in popularity|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: one of the advantages is that you put the overcaller on lead far more often|pg||

nt|finch: looking at all four hands I would prefer to playing a heart partscore than defedngin 1NT|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|finch: unusual for the nebulous club to gain in such a way|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: would mesbur have balanced with HA too?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|finch: doubling 1NT is not always take-out.  And even if it were, walshe may have thought hat defending 1NT would be better with EW vulnerable|pg||
mc|7|nt|sharkirl: true|pg||
nt|finch: Given he has a hand that may well have doubled a weak NT opening|pg||
