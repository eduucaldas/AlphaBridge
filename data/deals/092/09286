mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yuval10: W shows 5-5 as they play "Smolen" convention to show 5-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Even if you had a way to show an invitational major 5-5, would you consider it with this hand?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no|pg||
nt|paulhac: I may well do|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's quite unclear why W selected 4@h then|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Because in theory opener has shown 2-3 in the majors|pg||

nt|paulhac: Unless East is 2-2 most of the time the 5-3 fit will win|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah but he already showed what he have in majors, and it's not uncommon for E to open with 2-2-3-6 or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did he show 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|jbgood: but if you have a way of showing 5-5 then you should respect prd's 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H showed 4, no?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: let's see if a heart lead is forthcoming|pg||
nt|yuval10: i used to think that they play 2M from E as GF|pg||

nt|paulhac: K@H lead may still be OK for declarer|pg||
nt|chthonic: but fourth best not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac: But even on the K lead a club switch at trick 3 would be a killer|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|chthonic: this won't do it|pg||
nt|othered1: East has implied @H length, with check-back, so I can see why north avoided @H.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|c8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulhac: Should he not have cashed 2 spades after the 9@D as he knew they were 4-4?|pg||
nt|othered1: that would have been more careful|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes he should've overtaken @s with the T in hand|pg||
nt|paulhac: Even better Yuval|pg||
nt|yuval10: he wasn't sure about @s's 4-4 by the way, as Italians tend to lead the smallest every from, say, QJXXXX|pg||
nt|yuval10: *even|pg||
nt|paulhac: Now it needs a small club for the defence to have a chance|pg||
nt|othered1: with QJxxxx north might well have acted over 1@C|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe, and maybe not.... partner has passed, and anyway it's not the point, can very well be QJXXX|pg||
