nt|vincentk: 50 imps is a lot, but they still ahve to play for double points against the numbers 2 and 3|pg||

nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Bob Heitzman and Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Cindy Marshall|pg||

nt|idblu: Tony, Mike, Al, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW for Scotland are Frazer Morgan and Phillip Morrison|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: both students at St Andrews university|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong NT from north|pg||
nt|cindy: very strong  meaty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS got too ambitious in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c-2n-3@c-p is a sensible auction assuming inverted|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might be the final contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E leads a D against 3NT -- the 8 or 9 for preference -- W will have to shift to a low spade right away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brrr|pg||
nt|mamos: South is not well placed when it comes to making an opening lead|pg||
nt|mamos: it would be great if someone could tell us the scores|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: PB England 50 (2), Scotland 29 (2), Wales 26 (2) Northern Ireland 10 (1), ROI 0 (1)|pg||
nt|cindy: could be dont|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or i guess even the Q will do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too bad, cuter if low spade necessary|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit?|pg||
nt|mamos: Catherine (Evans) and Eve Hatfield are the WElsh North South|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
mb|2S!|an|3!S|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good hand for west|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT BY E|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North for Scotland is Jun Nakamaru-Pinder|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: vugraph just catching up|pg||
nt|mamos: one trick gone after q@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the club suit may go jack, king, ace, queen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: SORRY FOLKS WILL CATCH UP NEXT E ROLLING IN TRICKS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Tom Paske and Graeme Robertson playing for England|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT+1|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Kath|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: well judged on the cards ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey folks|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS here are ladies|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike, Kath, Cliff, Fred and Tony|pg||
nt|mamos: this cant be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can only assume Frazer intends 2 hearts as forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi Mike Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Kath and Mike :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some scores here: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not up to date |pg||
nt|mamos: NO:(|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: FYI, N-S are ladies, so please remember "she"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hurray|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North South are 2 ladies  hurray|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
nt|idblu: I think we probably will be in for some youthful exuberance...if I can go back to my own youthful bidding days :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: so these are the under 25s here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm more experienc might suggest to young Jones that on a weak hand with a six card spade suit, it is generally better to rebid the spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Scotland doing pretty well from the results i see, not sure how current|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Catherine and Eve|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eggy: ah - or pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not for me if it was 4315 (@c6 is a heart)|pg||
nt|april7: NS play weak NT so DONT not possible|pg||
nt|daman: that too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: winning play by declarer after a good auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: or pass 1S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|cindy: can play for overtricks now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: anyway 2@H is going to survive with perhaps an imp to Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not @d10 in trick2?|pg||
nt|cindy: good question|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless E bid 1 spade on a get your retaliation in first principal, but this may be two high..|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: ge Roland :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|capercliff: these ruffs actually help declarer in a way|pg||
nt|capercliff: but the A@h was an error|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so may get through|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cindy: four pitches will be painful for E|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole. Welcome to you|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: really?|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Helen|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||
nt|mamos: should probably make from here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idblu: home now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: 1NT seems normal though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: kind defence|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|nt|mamos: NS and West all female :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|april7: poor E|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: no wonder he passed, then|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|10|nt|cindy: good enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also a small @h to @hK is better than @hJ|pg||

nt|mamos: up|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!D or strong|nt|mamos: 3NT looks a more likely contract|pg||
nt|mamos: well England off to the fast start their previous record in the competition suggested they might|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: another partscore @S fpr EW and @H NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS?|pg||
nt|cindy: would be kind of pushy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other names dont sound Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what west wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 4@H  non vul :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i do too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but Northern Ireland played well last match for a good win|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 2 ladies NS in other room for N ireland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi mike|pg||
nt|idblu: hi mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: none of the other three are backward when it comes to bidding|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting jump shift in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 mikes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure of their ages, maybe girls?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when does a girl become a woman :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall !|pg||
nt|bobh1: set the auction up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is allowable at green but will not get a great result this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Here is Mike... he will know the scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Helen, could you please enter result on 13 manually?|pg||
nt|mamos: England are playing Wales in their final match but we don't know the relative scores of England Scotland and NI|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well we arent results merchants, most of us like the bid|pg||
nt|mamos: another possible game swing here|pg||
nt|benjy: He recently got engaged so he should be able to maintain his concentration|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: here we'll probably see 4sf etc|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, sadly Scotland missing 3 games|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Mini Paske will bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's a racy double of  1NT|pg||
mb|5D|nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: England have bid 4@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh they play strong @c in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: whats the over/under   for undertricks?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a heart lead may cause problems, but North is unlikely to find it here after the 1@H opening |pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here with 13 is an aggressive calll|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like at least 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
nt|mamos: hi ben|pg||
nt|benjy: Any thoughts on the lead? You could easily argue for a trump lead (my choice), dummy could have a ruffing value|pg||
nt|mamos: racy I couldn't possibly comment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that we don't have an updated ranking, but England has won the Peggy Bayer (U20) by a large margin, and the English U25s are also in a strong position to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now where will Ms Nash look for tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a maker now........... lead of small @D might have worked if led|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
nt|cindy: 4 now|pg||
nt|idblu: inverted minors...2@C game forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, @SK |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: It's Norma!|pg||
nt|mamos: I guess it's Catherine and Eve EW for Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: apparently 4n is RKC in @c's|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie in a friendly way so no probs|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep, would have been a lot in 6@c as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with clubs 3-2, this should be no problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We will get the right player names eventually; pls be patient|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: a poor switch why on earth does he want to ruff when he has natural trump tricks?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S looked 100%|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -2 it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's enjoying himself|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: NS ontrack here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: five star contract!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: watching poor east suffer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: don't understand this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: ac is reasonable a dim is reasonable a spade to the K is reasoanble but why has he plasyed the 2c??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see an upside to this play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think David Franklin is our operator now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: even if East responded to B/Wood :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bidding diagram is missing a couple of passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Whoever it is will be quite pleased to have an easy contract to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Thanks Kerry says Boyd|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 2 spades a bit pessimistic it seems from north this time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|capercliff: not that it is really biddable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no it didnt seem obvious|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats right Cliff, bid 'em up|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 opposite 12...need the hand records to bid 6 :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: another profit for NS|pg||
nt|cindy: think so ?  partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Claim 12 tricks before anything happens!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: 5sx escaped for 1 down and they defended 5C in open room|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Not important here, but as a metter of general tchnique you should aleays try to retain entries to both hands in trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: pitching @H now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s is too weak For me 3 possibilities. pass for penalty, 2nt or 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S does not open, N does not like his hand for game, especially with a lot wasted in hearts. maybe he would pass out the double at matchpoints, but even then EW are nonvul, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has a stiff stpade it could be ugly for NS (esp. if S has spade ace)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, north also had a option of playing in 2 hearts x |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|mariner1: no @D?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos: oh dear |pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: maybe 4 8s here|pg||
nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: I am told that England are 10 VPs ahead of NI in the Junior Camrose before the last round. England playing against Wales|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|april7: S tries to go down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|capercliff: and the K@d is waste paper:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|dburn: East probably ought to have risked 2@s, but that's the kind of action that comes with experience|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to play it out, it is MANDATORY to discard the jack of diamonds on the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's going to be endplayed in a minute|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||

nt|mamos: NS found their good save here|pg||
nt|eggy: It seems that Jones & Bell had doubled 3D on hand 1|pg||
nt|eggy: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think experienced players would enter the auction as East David|pg||
nt|cindy: 2@hx would scare me at IMPs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an option, but perhaps not an attractive one facing heart shortness. he can't count on more than 100, and may not get that, so why not just take an easy plus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's not like S rates to have Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: find it surprising that 4n is both intended and interpreted as RKC but they landed on their feet for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let W think for a few seconds that E has the diamond ace. then cash it. life's little pleasures|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess it was undo|pg||
nt|idblu: what systems are these pairs playing?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Norma :)|pg||
nt|mamos: with the 2-2 break EW can get home in 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well, gird up the loins girls!|pg||
nt|mamos: Richard and Brian had a tough time in the last match against Wales so perhaps this start will make them feel better!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i dont know, are they on ecats?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Partner said D and not 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: NSmight fall off their horse in 4@Sx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
nt|april7: 4th hand might balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pleased to here all of you defend Norths action at the table|pg||
nt|idblu: not strong NT n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might make a 3N here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe that's @H and a minor|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht cannot get to dummy to take the club finesse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: so he will be reduced to cashing the ace, with fortuitous results|pg||
nt|mamos: EW played 4@H in OR but North looks favourite to make 1NT  funny old game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, a passed hand should not reopen with D there without 4 spades|pg||
nt|idblu: it's been suggested that n/s are playing ACOL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a "do something sensible partner" double?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS don't appear to have a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing is the issue here to bring in the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont fancy it really|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: OR Scotland did get to game, but 4 hearts a difficult contract with handling problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will do OK on a club lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@DX prob their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s can be made double dummy - it can also easily be misdefended-a dim two ruffs and two hearts are easy for the defence but they will not necessarily also come tio a lub trick a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: club may go away on the third heart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant believe O'rourke is thinking |pg||
nt|capercliff: Phil and Frazer are a young Scottish pair, but have ben playing together for some years in fact|pg||
nt|benjy: e/w have a cheap save 500 if the defense take their ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: save would have been cheap|pg||
nt|mamos: or not:(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: 9 tricks look easy with the @D hook and a @H|pg||
nt|benjy: some might have overcalled 3@S with 64 shape at this vul|pg||
nt|chick: was it Larry Cohen who said, "I've spent my life bidding 4@S over 4@H" ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that solid 6-card @s suit 4@s is a master contract. Yes I see AKQJ10 as a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|mamos: West seems to have been a little passive here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: king is better|pg||
nt|mamos: still has seven tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps after some hearts west will allow a club finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps...... |pg||
nt|mamos: pick up diamonds?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but the defence may be difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: might as well keep on leading @s|pg||
nt|mamos: well bod|pg||
nt|mamos: bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear he should seriously downgrade his diamond holding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: O'Rourke overbid here|pg||
nt|mamos: well it was always a likely outcome|pg||
nt|idblu: this doesn't play well....but on values s/b in game |pg||
nt|mamos: I once asked Martin Jones about a 4@S bid by the late great John Collings over 4@H and Martin said John's philosophy was to bid 4@S and then look at his hand :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: low @c is clear now|pg||
nt|mamos: @cx |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and equally clear to go up|pg||
nt|bobh1: so maybe it's right to cash the A|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N will make on lie of the cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and 3NT may be difficult to defeat|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't always work, of course|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: play for the max!|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 24 combined points but very flat hands ghame not at all attratcive|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems odd that the singleton bids clubs and the 7-card clb suit bids hearts - I guess that is the modern game|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mamos: lol of course not but it's not always easy for the other side to know what to do|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
nt|chick: would be interesting to know the specific meanings of those bids |pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||
nt|april7: if short suit trial was possible in saystem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to eggy|pg||
nt|eggy: hI EVERYONE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actiually, couldn;t it be right to lead another heart? how does S know the diamonds are running? and N could have much better sopades|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: Ruth could afford K@D first|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: now the defence have burnt a trick ltho conmtract still one off|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East realised he had 2 entries to set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I'm guessing 2@H is a 3-card limit raise, and 4@C a cue|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd guess 2@H was a 3 card raise to 2@S but don't really know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Still, one feels West might chance a double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: smal @H|pg||
nt|idblu: chance for many now|pg||
nt|mamos: unpleasant moment for South|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: north gave it back he should never cover the JH|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: at this vul 7@S is unlikely to be worse than a few imps away defending 7@H risks a bucketfu|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: l|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to play big @D 1st|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bad news now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||

nt|daman: get your popcorn out   this might be exciting|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3H doesnt feel like enough to me|pg||

nt|mamos: Dbl   hehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quite a bit of difference between teenagers and 24 year olds|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should bid 4H in my uiew|pg||
nt|mamos: I know what do you do with a good Diamond hand .... etc|pg||
nt|chick: you think they are playing transfer advances?|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure |pg||
nt|mamos: what will South make of this?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting problem for South. Anyone expecting a discplined Pass from our Junior?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 card suit is not a takeout double|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll have to bid at 5 level soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he must think X and then bid @H is better to describe his hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eggy: EW need to be careful to check winners as well as losers here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jones like to open 1C. or else he has a defective bidding box|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry   im a @d bidder with E hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South does not have a clear action|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s can make but to bid it is another story|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for South|pg||
nt|mamos: had better pass :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe it could, but it would seem normal to arrive in only 3@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be 6 spades is on though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he isv ulnerable he needs a goodish hand to overcall 4h itys not too good for that bid|pg||
nt|chick: double for the spades, then correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
mb|3C!|an|asking for minor(s)|nt|ralfwil: pass on s???|pg||
nt|mamos: NS played in their 3-0 fit after West had opened 1@D|pg||

nt|daman: they don't play drury for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: still will be hard to stay out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knows he has to bid @H at the  5 level eventually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see the point of 1@S |pg||
nt|benjy: 1@S is madness|pg||
nt|chick: not do I|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have a perfectly respectable club suit|pg||
nt|mamos: surely going to land her in 4@S|pg||
nt|benjy: you have a 5 card suit and you want partner to lead a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
nt|april7: EW should stay in a decent @D partscore and NS should stay out of bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. can;t imagine passing|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm sure that's his intent, but this is the wrong type of hand for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they wwere always bidding at least 4s in any case|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has shown his partner a good hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually not good as the cards lie|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4!C|nt|mamos: Tom and Dom are more coservative than most juniors|pg||

nt|mamos: Blackwood with xx ???|pg||
nt|cindy: thats not a surprise is it ?|pg||
nt|idblu: major suits ultra favourable|pg||

nt|mamos: ugh|pg||

nt|ralfwil: old fashioned Culbertson asking bid! |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in @H not good|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5h doubled only 2 off|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona: Im for 6 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that lead 6s made|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
nt|dburn: double may have been more major-suit oriented - 2@c would not be such a good idea if North were 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|daman: passing is not an option|pg||
nt|april7: or even worse|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i could show both suits by specifying them right away, i might--certainly if NV i would. here i like  1D|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservative  new bridge adjective|pg||
nt|benjy: if fiona was my partner i would call the director and have the psyche recorded in an attempt to stop her from doing it in the future|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a make :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobh1: well done whatever it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, spades are 3-3 and the queen is onside|pg||
nt|chick: not a bad agreement to have|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: more optimistic than that George :)|pg||
nt|cindy: it does make 4S i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I don´t expect 3@cD be the final contract, I must bid 3@h on S|pg||
nt|cindy: and 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does it mean when you can't act over 1C, but you can act over a jump-rebid facing a passed partner when opps are unlimited but also have not shown a fit?|pg||
nt|mamos: my typoingis carp|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: what would you have him do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or well-guessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E cannot afford to double|pg||
nt|cindy: a guess i think|pg||
nt|dburn: bid 4@s, perhaps?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes on any lead perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade lead?|pg||
nt|idblu: also|pg||

nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has a 10 count, why should he cue bid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: I used to bid like that when I was their age :)|pg||

nt|daman: Smolski still bids like that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm sure I was worse but this is really just out of control|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be asking about @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: and @CKQ not looking good opposite splinter|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|bobh1: agree, the N hand is a little strong tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know what it´s called in english, but 4@h was an asking bid for control in @h|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure Or score is correct  I thought it was 2@Dx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H was an interesting choice - certainly might have tried 2@D first |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland seem to have judged well to bid 3 hearts here|pg||
nt|benjy: she can't play trumps now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CA, @H ruff, @CK for @H discard, @S|pg||
nt|benjy: but will get home if she leads diamonds from the top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Thinking cap on|pg||
nt|mamos: West trying telepathy  ?  It never works for me   this time it did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Diamond seesm marked - even if partner has another club trick it cannot be right to play a club.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don't think that is clear. just because S didnt make a neg double doesnt mean he cant have 4 spades|pg||
nt|capercliff: to play a @h again|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: yes the swings are starting to go the other way and what was a big English lead is down to a handful|pg||
nt|april7: at least now @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess (s)he was wondering which diamond to play - wnet for count card|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: our experts coments on board 2 justified by the score, as 4 spades went off open room on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Competently done|pg||
nt|chick: @CQ and another club could promote a trump trick for E|pg||
nt|mamos: thirteenth Club will complete the job|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|mamos: ok now well done|pg||

nt|mamos: neither pair seemed to get to grips with their values on Board 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This was a typical hand where you must act early. otherwise you are out-bidden|pg||
nt|cindy: first few hands have been interesting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S on that last hand, it would be useful to play that D by N shows three good hearts. since N did not rebid 1S and has a jump-rebiddablke suit in a good offensive hand on this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction, not a great idea to play it for penalty|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  thats true too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 4S should either be natural or a cue, by agreement|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know what it's called in English either|pg||
nt|idblu: we are all resulting here...in real life how many pairs would really get to 6 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens KQ clubs is enuf to ensure 6s cold with dim k onside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one, looking at xxx in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not a good slam really|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean hardly a biddable slam|pg||
nt|mamos: probably imps to England because contract was 2@D doubled in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Helen|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok so a semi-nice 3 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice 3 I think :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S normal here but unlucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still doesn't excuse the 1@S bid, imho |pg||
nt|mamos: I think many people think Fiona has a great future in the Women's game|pg||
nt|mamos: well in the game full stop|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: did E really made it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but perhaps also a win. 4@s is laydown|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H shows a desire to get the opponents into a thin game while telling them how to make it|pg||
nt|idblu: agree|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise for south|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably 2h some sort of weak 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: souith seriously fixed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H? Gosh|pg||
nt|chick: why not a great future in ALL games?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|idblu: double would work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree Marshall. 4@s must be a cue with @d support|pg||
nt|mamos: i got there first|pg||
nt|chick: lol  yes, you did :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idblu: e/w will find their @D now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neither can bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but what will n/s who have the balance of points fiind?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: looks a good wjo to me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not an overcall that you would want to show the children|pg||
nt|mamos: getting old Mike ?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: missed a pass operator|pg||
nt|petergill: A Pass By North is missing|pg||
nt|dburn: rubbish|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont know what I would have bid as South|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Very difficult after that bidding by EW|pg||
nt|idblu: fixed|pg||
nt|idblu: by system|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I would have overcalled in NT... but maybe thats not a success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's amazing what a few -800's do for you|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: Philip? East 2@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that opener but it worked for N ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: south can bid 3h over 3d which should be to play in hearts|pg||
nt|idblu: now we're stretching|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a bit high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NI stopped in 2NT on  3 - 11 to England|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: talking of thin games...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a bit too many... sac against 2 spades EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North was just competing but South thought invitational maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That looks a brave raise opposite 15-17, so maybe they play a wider range|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Each side had now propelled itself to a higher level than they needed to be at.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Makes it a tough game!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thing beginning to happen now re player names|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have them all - thanks operator|pg||
nt|mamos: game had play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H should come in and possibly 4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: what would North do with a 5=1=1=6 shape?|pg||
nt|benjy: 3NT is the practical bid on values but i would be worried about not showing my @C, with only Axx in @S it is not clear that 3NT is the correct spot|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: hard to believe that NS, looking at dummy, couldn't understand how important it was to play trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have leant on 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: I might have unsheathed the red card|pg||
nt|april7: X???|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever partner's 2NT meant I seem to have some good defensive cards|pg||
nt|daman: yes   double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E must falsecard with a top heart|pg||
nt|idblu: N didn't have any tries, other than double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: But south had already bid her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do  we know what NT they play at this vul?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobh1: according to steve robinson, open 1@s|pg||
nt|dburn: Nothing "must" be a cue bid if it can be natural|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: I have 4 tricks in my hand and my partner has competed red to the 3 level???  I whack 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: 3 dpwn and no X?!|pg||
nt|bobh1: but most others would often open 1@c depending on suit quality|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done by North to drop the @C109|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: it is a matter of agreements, david. you can go either way on the agreement, depending on what you think will be most useful to the partnership. i don;t care either way here, but i ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will observe that 5116 doesnt get dealth all that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1 off at best, beatig 140 I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we ladies get nervous about doubling|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: The poor defence to 5@D and a doomed 3NT in the open reverses the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: well declarer ok now if picks up Clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 8 tricks now unless she takes a first round club finesse|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: with the young players, you have to expect the unexpected|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|eggy: maybe an imp here at most|pg||
nt|idblu: asking for @C...|pg||
nt|mamos: East needs to play @d|pg||
nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly if 2@H is NF and West can pass 3@C  |pg||
nt|benjy: i very much doubt that|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer could easily play a @S to the Q here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idblu: I have a secret to tell you...so do we men :)|pg||
nt|idblu: or is that wee men|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec points out that 3N NS has play, but the spade bids did for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes they did  that's result merchanting|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like the somnambulist coup |pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: in 20 years we will forget all of this|pg||
nt|mamos: should be ok which ever way she plays|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: break in the excitement- time for a little refreshment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: well done ben|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjy: and now it looks like she is down on a @S return as long as the defense are careful|pg||
nt|benjy: a @H return would do as well|pg||
nt|chick: true, but not as clear ... her pard bid spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Fiona thinking long and hard!|pg||
nt|benjy: i cannot think of a case where a @S return is not correct. But it is always best to check!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Richard Boyd - Brian Sharkey  vs  Catherine Evans - Eve Hatfield|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|mamos: These are two relatively small countries with only a few young players |pg||
nt|daman: amazing|pg||
nt|april7: but we all learn from our mistakes hopefully|pg||
nt|daman: ducking the @C was weak|pg||
nt|idblu: @D Q will still score|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: still 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: would seem to be more useful as a cuebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats stops the endplay|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|eggy: although perhaps not enough entries for all teh ruffs now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 1 results: JC Wales-Scotland 14-16; England -Ireland 16-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade very unattractive play contract shouldstill go off |pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: well bidding and making 4 hearts is quite a coup on this lot|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: if S played the @H King at trick 1, North would not have ducked the @C  I'm sure|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing neither way, as some poet remarked|pg||
nt|mamos: Ian Jones enjoying himself here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|idblu: can't help but go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should of course play club and leave declarer tio do his own swork|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not opeing !NT on that South hand unless it shows 18 points|pg||
mc|9|nt|mamos: one more board at this table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N had to win on the hand!|pg||
nt|mamos: he was :(    hush my mouth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too much elation about the king of hearts falling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good comment received about 3@H. Bit of a methods tester - is double take-out or penalties, and is a bid of 3@S forcing or not?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: in fact she makes 9 by ducking a spade|pg||

nt|bobholl: they are worse placed i thougth they could win :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, this table played and claimed rather quickly so it might take a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: good round for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: i'd placed jansma paulissen at 1 or 2 and not at 11 as they are now :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: did you bet?|pg||
nt|bobholl: no i am not that convinced|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, we know they are capable of the best. just not today|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i bet vincent a beer that jansma paulissen will win the coming round|pg||
nt|vincentk: There are a lot of strong pairs here, two of the strongest dutch pairs didn't join btw (Muller de Wijs and Bakkeren - Bertend), assume they were to busy|pg||
nt|hedyg: playing in Australia|pg||
nt|vincentk: OK Bon, I ll bet on Brink-Drijver, what do you suggest?|pg||

nt|bobholl: and win :)|pg||
nt|vincentk: a beer  I see now|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: ...just the sort of things to put pressure on the oppo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think South showed her hand there |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@H didnt show her strength|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: thx to spectators|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks especially to Philkip our operator, thanks to NIBU and Sandy Millership (I know how nerve wracking it is to run one of these things)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? Well, I suppose they had more trumps than their opponents, but even so...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
nt|idblu: @H suits abound in this event it appears|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so North couldnt judge to go on |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or not|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: yes, that is likely to haunt him for a while|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: playing @c before trumps had solved everything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if n/s have heqard of blackwood they may stay out of slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am confident they will|pg||
nt|lestergold: confident they wikll stay ouit?|pg||
nt|benjy: i think most juniors would open the east hand at this vul|pg||
nt|mamos: Roland's favourite 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes stay out|pg||
nt|benjy: 4@H was a transfer to @S|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO and Roland for organising us all and thanks to you for watching |pg||
nt|april7: not easy to reach but we will see|pg||
nt|eggy: tricky bod for East though|pg||
nt|eggy: bid|pg||
nt|april7: this bid makes it possible|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D seems automatic|pg||
nt|eggy: not likely to get to 6C, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: he might barely have bid 2@d, which would not have been especially tricky|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is for the club allstars|pg||
nt|april7: W must be careful not to go to 6NT|pg||
nt|mamos: and to marshall and cindy and Bob and David and ralf for their commebts|pg||
nt|idblu: is this a KO event, swiss ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you i dont like that 2@C bid|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy not much help this loks likely to fail|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Kelsey once said - avoid Axxx against no-tump. Right here, diamonds works better|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a good hand yet has losers so no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, his actual effort might work pretty well|pg||
nt|mamos: a tricky hand|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eggy: Well tricky to get over the hand I meant :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes ralf in 3@H in the OR declarer did test Clubs|pg||
nt|idblu: round robin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a round robin|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north must be chaffing at the bit with that monster |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2@D bid might excite O'Rourke|pg||
nt|mariner1: S not counting her losers enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: unlikely that NS will bid this 10%- game, so a narrow win for England|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there you go|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have bid a lot of clubs even at this vulnerability with good 8 card suits you at least must take up the oppos bidding space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Somerville stayed strangely silent on this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is not a bad spot, but can go down on a @d ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: well 2@S works|pg||
nt|mamos: worked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is this a steal by EW?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - nothing much of anything makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is Ruth showing the minors ?  It doesnt look strong enough for aces|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|mamos: next session in twenty minutes or so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will east balance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensibly not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to the operator for showing us all four hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|idblu: and such a strong playing hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha enter dopi and ropi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or podi and pori|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if they know their ropis/dopis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cue for all round disaster|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt sure which suit North is interested in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well obviously dont play rkc |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North cant really bid again|pg||

nt|dburn: especially since West has shown already that she is not backward in coming forward|pg||
nt|april7: with @S fonesse even 6 NT, I miscounted before|pg||
nt|dburn: be honest now - how many of you lot could get to 6@c in four bids?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may have competed with 3 spades here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually correct technique on 2-suiters where there is work to be done to attend to the side suit before trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think this will make|pg||
nt|mamos: and apologies for my typing   thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for making us welcome and BBO for bringing this broadcast to us all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North find the @DK lead?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but the lead..|pg||
mb|6C!|nt|yo_yo: pass is 1|pg||
nt|idblu: everybody has it marked on their card...but when it comes up :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south hasnt a clue |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks ok, Mike|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe but not far from 4 hearts|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: Thats the trouble with that 2@C bid, usually agrees @S|pg||
mb|6S|nt|april7: only the youth|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if W holds off till 3rd trump play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: results will be posted here http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|idblu: or is P 1st step|pg||
nt|eggy: Still looks a trick short|pg||
nt|mamos: NS may be a little over excited at the thought of a big win and an englisg disaster but they wont get them like this|pg||
nt|mariner1: a little too much aggression here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has the dreaded multi found more victims|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass shows 1 inexperience playing in our 4/4 fit when you have a solid 7 card suit elsewhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now to negotiate the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right contract it seems as 5 hearts is off on the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: amd 5d off if they find the ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H goes down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 5h unlucky does go ionm the ruff andf5f makes but normally this should be plaed in hearts if we are not result merchants|pg||
nt|idblu: and of course we are not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you eating your words there Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Norths 2C bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|lestergold: eating which words|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think maybe both 5d and 5h are both going down|pg||
nt|idblu: ty Helen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: So there may be an adjustment as they were told it ws nat|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East was no longer sure all his Clubs were actually Clubs???|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|eggy: but perhaps declarer can pick teh spade suit?|pg||
nt|eggy: will take an exceptional read tough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: GREAT YAWNS FROM W!  LATE NIGHT?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: S king was a good card by W--not so easy for N to count W's poinmts|pg||
nt|idblu: that is not the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead surely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think EW were damaged|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C is a cue...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: any lead it makes as East only has 1 trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I am surprised the Irish boys dont know the unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: then when trumps are played take third diamond and play club leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Morrison will draw trumps and hope the @C run?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: making six (but West would lead @DK against a slam)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes a diamond would have been better from North again|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: probably still survives|pg||
nt|idblu: but still makes,,,has @H entry|pg||
nt|mamos: even 5@C cannot make so maybe not a real disaster|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: I know strong club pairs who couldn't get there in 20 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: No, it;s still early in the morning  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How many of you should duck the trumph lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: very strange auction|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould since i can see all four hands|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North cannot tell what is happening in hearts.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Next match:  Northern Ireland v Wales (Junior Camrose)|pg||
nt|mamos: and contract back to making now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to win and guess diamonds - play for split aces?|pg||
nt|mamos: if declarer can guess DiaMONDS|pg||
mc|12|nt|april7: W still need @S finesse|pg||
nt|daman: well    1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 4@C might be an auction that would impel us to slam|pg||
nt|eggy: not the best practioners of that black art it's true|pg||
nt|idblu: not now|pg||

nt|mamos: There is some merit in just bidding slams like that at least you don't look a fool when you miscount the Aces after b/wood|pg||
nt|cindy: ty roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a sensible ruling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope Adams wasnt put off with the director called|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S 1@C 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: will NS bid 4@S|pg||
nt|eggy: I think South did well to throw a spade in a way, as declarer might have read the suit otherwise|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps a slightly more straightforward board|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here though someone could be shoved up into one|pg||
mb|1H!|an|4+!H 11-16 can be canapé|nt|april7: 4@H and 5@D with @H finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: I WAS TOO INTERESTED IN SCORES STOPPED WATCHING :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|mamos: There are two competitions this is U25 - Junior Camrose and the Peggy Bayer U20|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps West should have played the hearts from dummy anyway as if N ducked the HA, it wouldn;t have helped|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N decides to scrpe a bid yes|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd bid 2@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: scrape*|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The play ended, not sure what happened|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: and 3NT with no finesses at all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: awkward bid now for Sharkey|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: let's hope EW get in the bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eggy: but with clubs 2-2, there were enough entries to not need the spade finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all ty Helen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi again Cindy|pg||
nt|mamos: not not not 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: appears to have claimed one off when she could have made :(|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps misguessed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Peggy B - Eng 175, Scot 118, Wales 83, Nor Irl 45 and Irel 33|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I doubt that - I think the opreator dropped behind the play, it happenes to the best of us|pg||
nt|mamos: even you LIz  ?:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: but now it can be difficult to find|pg||
nt|april7: good lead but W has a chnace for 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|capercliff: a NT never came to mind|pg||
nt|mamos: scrpe was better|pg||
nt|eggy: a splinter now should dampen any possible enthusiasm|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C would be my choice |pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: 4@H a mile off anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start by NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion E is too passive afre 1@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hardly a mile - but 4H is 1 down|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi mike, ralf|pg||
nt|mamos: calmer hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well o'rourke and Adams should brush up on Unassuming cue bids before the next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play 2/1 maybe that's their system|pg||
nt|capercliff: intended as forcing I gather|pg||
nt|mamos: but then 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Q for a make it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be slightly nervous playing 3NT on this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CQ would be a good lead here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet North finds it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I cannot tell a lie.... even me :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: but an interesting choice to not correct to 4@s holding a singelton|pg||
nt|eggy: that even more so :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: YES!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: what a player|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S pretty conservative partner did not have to bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: cunning lead|pg||
nt|eggy: Tom Paske is a tricky player, as you can see from the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: S's 1@D a warning here.......|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm pretty sure I'd end in the losing 4@S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes with the 3@C call it would be hard to avoid now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I would have done the inviting with the East hand, not the West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both boys hoping the other has shortage in @C|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike Amos is our table host and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|idblu: will ease the jitters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West: "What are your leads?" South: "Bl**dy good ones"|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this one will play itself- k hearts coming down in 2 wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: run the spade Q for 12|pg||
nt|mamos: even with only 23 points 3NT wasn't a million miles away|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: I confess to not having worked it all out but it appears natural to win @d in dummy and play Club|pg||
nt|mamos: a pretty quick one off I'd suggest|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth Connolly will be happy in a minute|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: I would think 4@S the %age bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed, are they playing 5 majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and even the Q @S is not co-operating|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idblu: everyone here would|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i agree - 3h on second round then smack them if they try 3 spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: E/W should certainly be competing as far as the 3-level|pg||
nt|mamos: all these four players are expeienced Junior Camrose players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in a way, South was fortunate that the @D10 was not from @DKQJ10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can certainly be made double dummy, but you cannot blame West after opening on this tripe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit unfortunate for the Irish boys|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Tournament site|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 50 minutes: Northern Ireland v England|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suppose they would have to be if playing a forcing NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not easy to defend, but this may let it thro'|pg||
nt|yo_yo: spade finesse for 9 now, run 10@S|pg||
nt|mamos: and partner has so clearly limited her hand - sensible bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i wonder why Fred!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are the scores still not updated?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|idblu: because we can see that works :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he cant read the cards as well as we can|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|chick: my partner would answer that question "Wall Street leads"|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|mamos: that looks a little over confident|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's on the right track|pg||
nt|chick: "standard and poor"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eggy: now that is a curious line|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy would be a disappointment if @SA was in South|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the Camrose Trophy, Lady Milne (women), Junior Camrose (U25) and Peggy Bayer (U20), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland play as separate entities, unlike other ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: international competitions where the Irish Bridge Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||
nt|bobh1: duckign the @s might have been safer|pg||
nt|mamos: and brother Myles and Giles start with a comfortable contract|pg||
nt|mamos: no:(|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: why??|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: East can draw trumps|pg||
nt|oliverc: this could get ugly now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 800 people wanting to know the current scores |pg||
nt|yo_yo: could i suggest in future events we get more up to date scores and also a chance to view the players CCs|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well done to the ladies|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|mamos: well what do we know|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: east not giving himself best chance of overtrick|pg||

nt|oliverc: That should raise some interest from East :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H overcall for very very very young|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fear :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is probably thinking about his methods here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: south hand very suitable for attempted suicide-|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|eggy: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: hi eggy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would expect more for a 3@H overcall. What about you, guys?|pg||
nt|eggy: I seemed to have arrived at a "sprightly" overcall|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is penalty so choice is double -only 300- 3NT or 4S- |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would never consider 3H even when I was young|pg||
nt|mamos: East West bid  quite soundly so East will expect a fair hand opposite I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- 500 for 3Hx - the preferred option|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: If West is showing a probable 5-5 with a Minor, East must surely be interested in a|pg||
nt|oliverc: Minor suit slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4@c is forcing, so that´s my bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that score card doesnt look too healthy for NI|pg||
mb|2D|nt|odysseus69: slam needs too much|pg||
nt|mamos: even my generous spirit can resist suggesting that declarer's line was poor there -- no clear plan |pg||
nt|april7: oh yes ace of @C and ace of @S,sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S would like to bid but has no good bid|pg||
nt|mamos: INT |pg||
nt|idblu: may get overboard once N opens|pg||

nt|yo_yo: so you dont make a fool of yourself|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: whenever the English were getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the Question|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: no need when pard overcalls in spades|pg||
nt|idblu: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor will e/w be finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a theory that you should bid 1NT on the East hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6c or dim looks lioke a good save|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer did not have enough entries to finesse @s and @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 17 they did open the chunky 17 in 1N and are playing it there in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: will make 2 and lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think we've seen this 2@H bid before today 3 card Spade support or perhaps some other types|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah is that what it means|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eggy: 1066 and all that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely you jusy have to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep perhaps 6 clubs x|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H might not persuade partner top move|pg||
nt|mamos: to move|pg||
nt|eggy: has another chance though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to get to 4 hearts though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so is double|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: sensible stuff|pg||

nt|lestergold: but he did thats sheer inxperience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to overrule partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky this isnt a make really|pg||
nt|mamos: surely will bid now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a cheap save|pg||
nt|idblu: nice support N bought :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: NS are female Kerri North Ruth South|pg||
nt|mamos: gosh wrong again|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Goodness me - I would bid like this without @CA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: can the defence prevail?  |pg||
nt|mamos: fast forward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some may wonder why N didn't bid 2C. but if NS style is regularly to make less-than-fully-prepared TO doubles, N cannot count on a fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure why east was so keen to defend either|pg||
nt|idblu: nice stop|pg||
nt|chick: W's spade bid gives the @SQ full value, plus diamond fit and A in the last suit|pg||
nt|chick: E was far too timid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well a good spot for the boys|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cJ from W had been bingo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer 3@H there, 4@H sounds like a splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|idblu: thats what N thought|pg||
nt|mdgraham: west will be miffed to see @S10xxx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pretty well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 4th best would probably have worked :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Routinely, you play low from dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: yes but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 ducks in @c a @h shift is needed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but not enough as declarer can duck twice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Will Ruth signal her A@D ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|idblu: can make 6 with the @D hook\|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And there is a large bonus for bidding and making vulnerable games|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: yes - but if you lead 4th declarer has A10 doubleton|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: good save though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: i think it is asking too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for a club lead on this auction holding such poor spades and a club sequence. but either could be the winner. |pg||
nt|mamos: good effort...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idblu: but thats double dummy|pg||
nt|chick: looks to me like NS have only a partial in spades, so down 2 or 3 is a poor result for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: on the 6@C hand NS are in 3N in Open|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idblu: better take the @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant see 6....|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure he could have got an extra 200 a level higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: how doeshe know whether to play heart or spade now?|pg||
nt|idblu: u get 3 @H pitches|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: timing must be just right for that I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 110 or 140|pg||
nt|chick: vs a likely 300 now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|pc|c4|nt|mamos: now is the crucial..|pg||
nt|idblu: he doesn't|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lost a trickl|pg||
nt|lestergold: expensive |pg||
nt|idblu: E fault for not cashing|pg||
nt|capercliff: always a @h and a @s to lose no?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so|pg||
nt|eggy: now should switch to hearts I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N also does not compute so -200 might score|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: more bloodletting since 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: moment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well nearly there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could W not switch to hearts? he can count a set if E has D king|pg||
nt|mamos: lots and lots off|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|idblu: i thot E had 3 @S's my error|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6 would be much closer if S did indeed have a splinter:)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: 5 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: actually 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||
nt|mamos: Kelsey wrote about 40 good books ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and several great ones|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy for south|pg||
nt|mdgraham: discard diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not easy for east because east doesnt know of double fit and doesnt know that 2 hearts arent cashing if played thru|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose East doesnt take West for tricks, with his preemptive 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our first match after the lunch break will be Northern Ireland vs England (Junior Camrose)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: signalling test - remember East opened 1@C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: but could see the @H going away|pg||
nt|lestergold: jump fits word work well on these hands|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close match now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: but England will get an imp (assuming East plays a club)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: it is, but it's not easy to say which of North and South should have bid more|pg||
nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and going wrong now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this|pg||
nt|mamos: this won't do :(|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: well   actually 8 more IMPs in the pocket for Ireland|pg||
nt|eggy: oops|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|chick: as a spec points out, 3N for NS is not impossible, and it looks like that is what they will make on defense|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: He's OK - club mow makes it|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|d|nt|vincentk: question is if tehy will bid 5@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@S=@D i think|pg||
nt|vincentk: that's not that cold|pg||
nt|vincentk: 1@S is not 4+ spades I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: So we have Mrs. and Mr. Brink here, Jansma's girlfriend and Paulissen's wife. We need someone to support Bas here... lol|pg||

nt|hedyg: @s was alerted|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: hi Jack :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: adventures in card play (with Geza Ottlik) and Bridge for the Connoisseur come immediately to mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 7 passed out both rooms... good to see such sound bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: double is more or less normal, even automatic. What would you do - pass?|pg||
nt|idblu: cashing @H A denies @SA...after the ruff W will know what to do|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes fit jumps good system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But there is one more opportunity for the Scots to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 25-3 now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: having thrown a club, he must play to set up a long heart|pg||
nt|mamos: Where Catherine and Eve beat 3@H on Board 16 (and could have made anextra trick with a trump promotion)Irish EW let 4@H make in OR |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well defended NI|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops it looks like they blocked the @S suit in Open on the 6@C/3N hand|pg||
mb|1D!|an|(0)1+!D 11-16|nt|vugraphzjj: sorry fir the break - lost connection|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have a huge major fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: overcall from E hand?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is very important to cash your winners. Maybe spades had never been bid...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: majors for sure|pg||
nt|mamos: and Ns minors of course|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1C promise clubs- do we know?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in majors against 5@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as used in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer unblocked|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!D's|nt|april7: and a free @S bid by S|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks easy enough here|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case surely a massive jumop inm hearts would show thenature of west'shand even withour specific jump fit agreement|pg||
nt|mamos: They hadnt but they weren't lead at Trick 1 and were on view in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they can get around that with @D though|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: I don't know but I think it's likely|pg||
nt|daman: Wales just gained an impossible 13 IMPs to make the match closer|pg||
nt|mamos: ewww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how can it be "sound" when all pass. that is silence, not sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Marylin  Monroe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not from me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suit too bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on 19 E for Wales passed pout 1 spade for a swing|pg||
nt|idblu: a high scoring...but close match|pg||
mb|5C|nt|april7: also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: steady..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@H NS, and West will be quite tempted to save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mamos: can't call that timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@h is better than 5@s!|pg||
nt|mamos: South will surely do something but surprised N did not double|pg||
nt|capercliff: im a @s bidder|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ralfwil: Yes Kelsey is one of my favourites. all his analyzes are perfect|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: ur too young to know it was a term for shapely hands uised in the fifties for some reason|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur too innocent to be told |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a club lead beats 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: North's pass should not be forcing at this vul and this type of auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about "more or less". i specifically agree with the "less" part. yes i would pass|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks a usual contract and 4th highest seems to beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: and North presumably thinks so too, or he would have doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades -2 looks to give EW a chance here|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S too rich for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5 part scores in a row for EW - must be quite rare in a Junior event|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mamos: less than automatic for me|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit odd, obviously not GF because they arent in game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is there 6@D coming?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick for tournament scores and format|pg||
nt|mamos: NS look like +500 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h shift will make -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 200|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h shift is also safe with @s K102.|pg||
nt|eggy: e|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right - as long as North still has lead|pg||
nt|eggy: But S may overtake and cash the diamond|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Right, but in my opinion N has to decide the defence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can tell N to shift to D with his signals but its only a recommendation|pg||
nt|mamos: undo Helen|pg||
nt|mamos: pass missed :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|chick: maybe, W has no defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I have also met him at the table. He was always correct|pg||
nt|cindy: im not liking that 2@s bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky contract for south|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: looks like an overtrick here   next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the bad slit may be a problem here|pg||
nt|capercliff: well, its not GF apparently|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S looks normal|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@S passed out would be OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: another singleton Ace lead |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: ugly indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: agree about 2S. this is a defensively oriented hand except for the sixth vclub, which has already been shown|pg||
nt|chick: its a good save, 5@H is makeable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values in the black suits, and partner may have nuisance values in trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 1@d as S, not 1@s on that "poor" suit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think West is lucky that 5@H is making|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another suit pref signal too|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|capercliff: noone lets you play at the 1 level these days Fred|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The English players are more experienced and it shows. For example, E-W in the open room are 13 and 16 years old respectively. Ralph Wiseman 12, Yonne (his sister) 16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ralph 13 that is|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree with 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has to be bid but it isnt all chopped liver|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...for this looks to make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: probably you play these well, Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: no i dont|pg||
nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NI back in the lead after 5d -1 OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||
nt|cindy: its not N|pg||
nt|cindy: lol marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure if you bid 1@D you let West bid 1@h|pg||
nt|cindy: if S is interested in hearing from N again, he will balance|pg||
nt|idblu: I know that...I live in the 60"s|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: It happened on 15|pg||
nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: and of course many of them (including these two) have played at U20 world level|pg||
nt|chick: with N's double, he may get the @Ds wrong|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: the thing is, by bidding 4@D then 5@D, you have forced NS to guess at the 5-level - why assume that they have guessed correctly? |pg||

pc|d4|nt|idblu: transfer?|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is more like the Phil I know....|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: shh  F words ?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: boys like to show off in front of girls, you guys know that|pg||
nt|idblu: I might defend 2@S on this vul|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this looks like ending in 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will she show her 5 card major?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobh1: v unenterprising by W|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 1NT was weak|pg||
nt|cindy: wow|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree, nice holiday for them, except it;s too near home|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told this is carrot.......... as in Bug's Bunny's "What's Up Doc"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: 2NT for minors|pg||
nt|mamos: many pairs play that Michaels (my favourite convention :) ) is weak or strong not intermediate|pg||
nt|mamos: so for me no|pg||
nt|cindy: its a pretty strong weak if so|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably this is 5 card majors with a forcing NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: if it was weak then i disagree with the failure to promote to strong :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it seems to me that everyone is falling over themselves to encourage young blood|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: Elmer Fudd's First Law of Opposition For every Duck Season there is an equal but|pg||
nt|mariner1: opposing Wabbit Season.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idblu: my wife is from Belfast, so I have an affinity to these kids|pg||
nt|mamos: last board seems alittle unlikely that Scotland will gain more than 1 imp so a very successful match for England|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: amazing that East passed 2 @S|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT only ok if for minors and not to play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: if that outside junk were in my suits, YES|pg||
nt|bobh1: not if you don't mind missing games :)|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it is not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's wrong with the old blood!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie nicely here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this should make not equiring rosenberg /zia declafrer play skill|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@C stayman?|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps Scotland can get a consolation imp here? It would be worth a VP too|pg||
nt|eggy: It's possible, but hard on that lead I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cindy: agree bob|pg||
nt|cindy: its beyond maximum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor West has nowhere to go for tricks here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then one might expect South to pass 2@H.|pg||
nt|mamos: I know slightly odd but a safe enough outcome|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose bidding again keeps EW out of spades, but they would probably have bid them by now if they were ver going to|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: in which case it was normal - no harm in being maximum once in a while|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even +2 possible it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: costly spot lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is tight|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt pretty probably encourage East to do it again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: up the anti,,, good defence required|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever it is it looks spectacularly unsound but fun to me :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|idblu: wish trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|capercliff: always going off I suppose|pg||
nt|chick: yep, and everything is offside|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzjj: the average age (I would guess) is less than 20 - it is sad to see them denigrated by'world class' players|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @d now I predict|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idblu: 2345|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make 6 needs to finesse club and establish 4th club|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|idblu: another wasted spot card|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this can be tricky|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: don't agree with that - @H7, surely |pg||
nt|mamos: I want to bid at the Two Level with no long suit and 11 points ??  I don't think so|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: dont forget Mike, they are young and fearless |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how many of you had a @s lead from S instead of @dK|pg||
mc|6|nt|lestergold: and looks like he can do taht|pg||
nt|idblu: down 1 probably best she can do|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|nt|hedyg: looked like -3 to me......|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjx: The players told me 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vincentk: well, nice boards|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: so you missed the @c switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I guess|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: that's a man's bid!|pg||
nt|vincentk: practical bidding|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brgpro: 4@c=high card raise to 4@h...he must have believed that his pd didnt have much in @c|pg||
nt|vincentk: yes, the 5@C bid helped|pg||
nt|vincentk: still hearts 3-0, so declarer needs to be darefull|pg||
nt|hedyg: wonder why they only made 11 tricks in the CR|pg||
nt|brgpro: but...the play is the thing!|pg||
nt|bobholl: this good for your beer vincent :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: can he manage?|pg||
nt|vincentk: He shoudl ruff @D in time|pg||
nt|vincentk: I think|pg||
nt|brgpro: does he have enuff entries?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Brink asked what the @CT meant, and Jansma and Paulissen both said it denies the Q|pg||
nt|bobholl: BOTH !!!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: but not the K?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vincentk: @D a is a very good card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Jansma proclaimed he heard Brink's "gut feeling"|pg||
nt|brgpro: just enough entries to set up the @d i think. with @h 3-0 but luckily the 3rd trump is with the 4th @d|pg||
nt|vincentk: yes, looks like it, but @D a shows he knows @H might be 3-0|pg||
nt|brgpro: ruffing a @d now and play a trump back looks best |pg||
nt|bobholl: but has to ruff @D before drawing 1 trump|pg||
nt|brgpro: i guess he will do it anyway|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vincentk: now he needs to ruff a @D|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to ruff 1@D first|pg||
nt|vincentk: still this is getting tricky|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he can still recover although he doesnt have enuff entries to set up the @d|pg||
nt|bobholl: play @S now :)!|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can set up the 4th @s in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: as Niek says, now set up the @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes sry Jack|pg||
nt|brgpro: use @s to coup E|pg||
nt|vincentk: I think he ll see it's his only chance|pg||
nt|brgpro: i am surprised that he didnt ruff a @d first then play a trump back...|pg||
nt|brgpro: was the danger that great???|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D from Jansma seemed to worry him|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont think so...|pg||
nt|hedyg: any other reason?|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma did the best he could :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he usually does :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i am losing my beer i fear|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|brgpro: but if @d 10 was singleton then heis trump play needed W to have both singleton @hJ and @d10...didnt look very much likely...|pg||
nt|vincentk: if not, I ll tell Brink to pay|pg||
nt|vincentk: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|brgpro: so ruff a @d then play a trump back looked the best line to me|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c4|nt|brgpro: now @h back to be sure beating this contract|pg||

nt|mamos: lol  good argument would tou open 1NT 15-17?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Even if 1nt is weak, wests hand is worth a rise to 3@s.  With 4-4 in majors I had asked for majors and after 2@d, my bid is 2@s, as an invitation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board and 15-15|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match tonight in about 20 mins: JC  Scotland v Wales|pg||
nt|mamos: decalrer has maintained control sensibly and wiill make not that many|pg||
nt|mariner1: Galbraith's Law of Political Wisdom : Anyone who says he isn't going to resign, four|pg||
nt|mariner1: times, definitely will.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that something to do with bridge Rob ?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5!H-4!D 11-16|nt|idblu: OR is finished|pg||
nt|chick: 2N wasn't a terrible bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very interesting though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I mean 6-4 in majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry two to go|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H partial plays well here|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I resign often :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: agreed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just didn't work|pg||
nt|mamos: +3???   surely not|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, how did he not lose the @CQ and a spade at the end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for me E has an opening with 4-4 in majors and 12 P|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H  didn't go off   oh dear oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah we missed board 10|pg||
nt|april7: cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that NI must be about the most experienced team this year Mike|pg||
nt|daman: should just jump to game now|pg||
nt|daman: signing off|pg||
nt|mamos: ten i think|pg||
nt|chick: long weekend for the operators too :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 10 looks a more likely number|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: then E might continue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with Easts 2 spade bid, its difficult for the west hand to stop|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t see why W would nopt bid stayman no matter what their range is|pg||
nt|cindy: i know|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe not sure of their methods|pg||
nt|cindy: this could get doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some results on :http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: if NS were vul this would get doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: N should double in my opinion|pg||
nt|cindy: heart A wont be good lead|pg||
nt|dburn: What you are doing is claiming that East underbid with 1NT, but that is because you saw all four hands. Maybe West underbid by passing 2@s.|pg||
nt|cindy: no  it is NOT because i saw all four hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S is a tad wet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: certainly the 3 mowen hace been in the JC for the last 4 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can do a lot of damage to this, buti cant double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction can;t be right, can it?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Is this right Helen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this right?|pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT sahowed a @S stop     .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N may feel that facing a NV weak 2 they are not necessarily odds-on to make game, and they are not that likely to beat 4S more than one|pg||
nt|bobh1: She has 3 tricks, maybe partner has one |pg||
nt|capercliff: now to mke it|pg||
nt|idblu: this helps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another tricky contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1NT looks like the bid of a player who has not seen the 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: :(   no problem |pg||
nt|cindy: i totally believe in upgrading with a good five card suit   |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of undos|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eggy: women|pg||
nt|mamos: it's very hard to do vugraph operation thanks to our op she's done great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: absolute the best lead!|pg||
nt|cindy: and all aces and kings outside|pg||
nt|cindy: and W also underbid|pg||
nt|cindy: conconservatives|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservatives|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: who likes 2@h over 2@s|pg||
nt|idblu: at least 3@H, 1@S and 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Jack was the card...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: daclarer a chance now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all pass the North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it may lead to 4@S being doubled |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope  wrong operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it may be 3 hearts from west, etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator pls undo!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Helens done really well so far, thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: AFTER 2@S PASS BY S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... but its hard not to bid 2 spades also|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok this is a short version of the bidding|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy: i assure you i make no comments based on seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not me i play 21|pg||

nt|mdgraham: broadcast.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well at least the @H game was not likely to be found either|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
nt|mamos: and ew are to high|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@H E bid 3NT and W 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 2 spades went -2 OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like it would help, right?|pg||
nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair I open|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT looks possible |pg||
nt|idblu: made 1N in OR|pg||
nt|capercliff: passing twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Borderline whther she should re-open or not. After all partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Also thanks to my fellow commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA), Mike Amos and Ben Green(England). I am Mike Graham (also England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments.  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like passing vs Acol (say) as they are usually in the wrong contract cf 15 in OR|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and could not act over 1@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: he would cuebid 3@S over 3 @H   yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope all comments are based on experience|pg||
nt|capercliff: if S cant bid over 1@c then there is no future|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eggy: well Cat has, but 3 year ago they were struggling to put a team in at all|pg||

nt|mamos: fun|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: she :)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: play seems to have drifted now..|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|cindy: not agreeing with either of you|pg||
nt|idblu: N will get endplayed in @D eventually|pg||
nt|mariner1: last two EW bids reminds me of the Gadarene Swine Law :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: then 4@C by E and might end up to high though|pg||
nt|cindy: mike and marshall|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idblu: auction will go the same|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to establish a diamond trick, though- |pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: cannot bid 3@S and 4@C simultaneously Avram|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual lol|pg||
nt|mamos: ow?|pg||
nt|cindy: ew?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I liked that Mike! But you must consider bidding and the hand who has to act|pg||
nt|mamos: did declarer duck @Dk|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1:  http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Tournament site|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E did not bid 4S. he barely had a 2S bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +1 for a push now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||
nt|daman: West will not cue|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he bid 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: and cindy and Marshall and ralf|pg||

nt|vugraphzjx: We'll be taking off with boards 17 and 18 so we can get comparisons throughout the play, except for the first two boards, of course :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards again friendly for 4S- an unlikely spot|pg||
nt|daman: final board of the set now|pg||
nt|april7: it depends whether 3@D is gameforce or just raise to at least 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last hand of this match coming up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a close thing it is too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ill-advised i would say. he doesnt have a heart stopper really and he has a terrible hand. if W couldnt act over 2H, how can there be game? |pg||
nt|cindy: thx all   think next set in about 20 minutes ?|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another void, great hands this match|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: here we go with the last board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so chances for East, but a push|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last board and a close match|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1@s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the 6@D hand, 4@H went one down, on what looks to be a complete aberration|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In that case we can be sure they will not have it easy - against England Scotland always do their best|pg||
nt|chick: one board to play in this room, 4 yet to compare|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone  |pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to all the vugraph ops and the NIBU and Sandy Millership for organising the event|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: S did very well to stay off the @h lead|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to fred and Kath and Tony and Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we like that multi?|pg||
nt|idblu: if that is supposed to be a weak 2 ...I don't like it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: another 4@S by EW|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for letting us join in and thanks to you all for contributing and to BBO and Roland for organising this  More soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all. see you again in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 aces and a void,   hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: especial thanks to helen our operator  and to BBO for putting on the show|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 20 minutes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and 4 of other major|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: and 6-4 in the majors. It has all the flaws for a weak 2|pg||
nt|mamos: last hand for today 4 rounds tomorrow starting at 11 am uk time check for local times just under 12 hours from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: uh oh|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: Yes Victor I was thinking EW might get too high but if they do they may make game :)|pg||
nt|mamos: about 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|mamos: and to NIBU and Sandie Millerchip for organising event in Belfast|pg||
nt|mamos: Thanks to the players - if we have been critical it's for their own good :)  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like weak nt with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sadly NI got it wrong OR|pg||
nt|mamos: West did something she will regret in OR  the pressure is great|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nothing like a few flaws, Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d i assume is not meant to be a two suiter|pg||
nt|capercliff: phew tx operator|pg||
nt|mamos: our last board here |pg||
mb|3S|nt|wilkinsona: no way for this to go off it seems..|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|chick: would anyone act with the S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: happy with 1Nt rather than 1S?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I hve a religious aversion to 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I would usually, but I think this a suit oriented hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the spectators and to your commentators , George Avram David and Steve|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the players and Philip our operator  Good job|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
nt|mamos: Cornelia and Liz|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to our operator - Duncan is what roland told me|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: The Spade suit has good texture  prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps with 5 small in the major|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that I'd be totally happy if East responds 2D|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU especially Sandie the match organiser and BGB|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW inthe auction|pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt it be more productive to open 1S in 3rd seat than to let them get two bids in first|pg||
nt|bobh1: assuming support x's, pass with the S hand might be attractive|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I'm sure Sandie will forgive me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not meant to have 4 hearts on the side|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to tony kath and cliff|pg||
nt|capercliff: thanks all was good fun|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone |pg||
nt|mamos: and to our wonderful operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks to all in Belfast (just north of)|pg||
nt|idblu: thx everyone...fun working with you all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and fred didnt i type that sorry fred|pg||
nt|mamos: helen well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have to say i could hardly pass 4S once S has doubled 3C. there goes my whole hand on defense|pg||
nt|mamos: Thanks to BBo and thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult hand for NS to handle|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south does well to remove the x of 3 spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon South has enough to raise to 5@D - North has followed a very strong sequence|pg||
nt|mamos: South has not understood how strong North was|pg||
nt|mamos: forcing p to bid at the Four level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and diffcult to bid 5 clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: hmmmm  E-W  are playing in the open room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland have missed the game bid by Paul and MacIntosh in the open Room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S names are OK, but we need some English players as E-W. The names we have now are Scottish|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and they are playing in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: About to be corrected|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: South for Scotland is Ruaridh Ellison from Kirkcudbright|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that lead may tip declarer off - may well try both major aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this has chances as cards lie|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth Connolly decided to teach the boys a lesson|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|mamos: thanks to the NIBU and especially Sandie Milership for sharing the event with us and thanks to yo all for coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South in the other room bid 1NT, but the spade stopper looks a bit iffy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idblu: nowadays a weak 2 in a major can have 4 in the other major|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mamos: results are now up for first four rounds http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos: Does anyone know reults for other tables this round?|pg||
nt|idblu: this should make easily|pg||
nt|jtr: I am the only one just north of it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so thanks David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: make sure the youngsters get to bed early David!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: agree Cindy. A third hand opening is to prefer here|pg||
nt|jtr: Pleasure:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: could easily be a double game swing, especially if S has a stiff diamond, which is far from unlikely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|mamos: bye all :))|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a last board win for England, thanks to all in Belfast and see you soon |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess, opening the West hand with 1NT when 2@C isn't 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|oliverc: seems a little self-defeating to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that even with 1S opener they would have stopped in 3S which looks enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well there are a few schools of thought on that subject Fred|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable hts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most come down against that one|pg||
nt|idblu: anyone do a bed check?|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to bbo and to NIBU especially Sandy Millership (last year after the dinner on Sunday we played Speedball at about 1am and Sandy was the winner |pg||
nt|jtr: The dogs?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|mamos: 1@S opening seems normal in third at favorable|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless it's a very weak suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idblu: I don't disagree....but many do....very old school :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: looksm like about 11 tricks probbaly two trumpo tricks for the defence now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on this hand EW would have found game with west passing, so no harm done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike can you go next time and do the running scores for them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and post the CCs whilst you are at it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a big win for Wales, thought Irlenad have a probable game swing on board 20|pg||
nt|mamos: what lesson was that  Kath? looks like a make to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: disaster for the girls this match|pg||
nt|mariner1: bye all!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some good learning points though|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|idblu: thx again..gn all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: phew it was a hard set|pg||
nt|dburn: and something of a pickup here also|pg||
nt|mamos: Looks like the WElsh will win this match which will please them and their supporters (not to mention my wife)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: 4S looks as if it needs heart finesse + 3-3 hearts - although in practice the spade position helps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: a @h lead had made the contract a little bit more sensible|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: may make 11 for 16-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: id be surprised tho if the west hand qualified for the bid that was made|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still a maximum win for England|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Yes - nice attitude|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: fine job by England, congrats to all|pg||

nt|vugraphzjx: Besides, my brother and sister always tell me Heineken is just as growse as American beers :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: believe me you can get great beer in USA|pg||
nt|hedyg: not necessarily Dutch|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Lots of family - kids and wives - running around now :) Taking down the screens might prove difficult |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Belgian then? (Most Belgian beer companies were founded in the time it was still a part of the Netherlands :))|pg||
nt|vincentk: you should be running arround too.. for scores ;)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: They're online sooner than they are on paper :)|pg||
nt|vincentk: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/USS_2_Page1.do?event=goToPage14&rndid=52208&verid=3&catid=|pg||
nt|hedyg: you just want to grab a sandwich before they are all gone :)|pg||
nt|vincentk: and refresh a lot, then you are the first to know|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: :) Inside jokes are fun :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I'm putting my cellphone on the F5 key so I won't have to keep tapping it :) j/k|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: tired fingers?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: brb, gonna run to the TD table real quick|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I don't think the scorers play games as much as I do :) They don't type really fast lol The final ranking is known, but won't be announced until (I think) Max Abraham does|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh|pg||
nt|vincentk: tell them 700 people are waiting|pg||
nt|hedyg: so they wont post it either till then|pg||
nt|vincentk: maybe Abraham can loggin on BBO to tell..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: The TD is now summoning the players to check their scores|pg||
nt|vincentk: k|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: New score's up! http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bas :)|pg||
nt|vincentk: OK, Sjoert en Bas by a big margin...congratulations to Drijver-Brink|pg||
nt|hedyg: congrats to Brink/ Drijver |pg||
nt|vincentk: second very good win in 10 days|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok....i am expecting my beer....|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: just what Drijver wants to hear|pg||
nt|hedyg: really 2@S?|pg||
nt|robbg: Why not @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I must say, there's a lot of noise now, not a very bridge-friendly atmosphere. I think Bauke Muller would be glad he's not playing :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jwit: That is a strange rebid, unless he feared 2H might be more forward going|pg||
nt|hedyg: or didnt want to bid a suit Ramondt had promised|pg||
nt|jwit: Trump here best|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might play J@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: no won't until houston|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Hey Steve :)|pg||
nt|vincentk: he ll play a @S|pg||
nt|jwit: Should|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: They stopped play and are now examining the scores :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then he will think some more......|pg||
nt|vincentk: but ofcourse he doens't know declarer is voin in @C|pg||
nt|vincentk: d|pg||
nt|jwit: How true|pg||
nt|jwit: May want to knock out diamond Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Seems like NS have 89 IMPs and 67 IMPs belong to EW here|pg||
nt|vincentk: yes, so a @D looks normal too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: The paper version of the ranking was just brought to the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bas|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jwit: And the auction won't help West.  He has no idea declarer is 5-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|vincentk: that's only 11 imps in this match! |pg||
nt|vincentk: double points|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: But online says 92-64...|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely E has 6@Hs so N should have at least 4|pg||
nt|vincentk: 92-64 indeed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: Yes Hedy, but 5 is certainly unexpected|pg||
nt|vincentk: that's 14 imps needed by Ramondt - Westra|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vincentk: the @H 3 is a very good card|pg||
nt|jwit: Sure is|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard for Ramondt as well!|pg||
nt|hedyg: now K@C?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jwit: Not the best defense here|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d back was definitely best|pg||
nt|robbg: no but they can still go +|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: if he ducks this another @H ruff|pg||
nt|robbg: then a trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: New paper scoring has arrived at the table now, but the players doubt it's correct|pg||
nt|vincentk: are they checink it again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: So the TD said he'd go and check it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Drijver: "I absolutely don't have a clue as to what to do"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: The TD just came and said the scoring was correct indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 92-67?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: NT will actually play quite well with the super favorable stiff K's in the rounded suits|pg||

nt|jwit: In a vacuum, ducking would appear best here, but on lay of the cards, won't work too well|pg||
nt|robbg: This was not the best % play in the @d suit but playing low to the T subjected declarer to an entry-killing play if it was wrong.|pg||
nt|jwit: Very true Robb|pg||
nt|vincentk: he's only in 2n|pg||
