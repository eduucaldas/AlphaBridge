nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||

mb|2D|an|10+p, 5+!D|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many play it|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||

nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: @s I mean|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: although the 9@H is great card to have in that holding|pg||
nt|viren169: not a good switch|pg||

nt|athene: east might lead the @DA though if north doesn't show the suit|pg||
nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|1N!|an|one round forcing|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|2C!|an|2+!C|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||

nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||

nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|an|check back stayman|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||

mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||

nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... 1N-3N for me|pg||
nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever south does, west will probably just bid the same 3nt he was going to anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||

nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||

pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||

pc|h2|nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||

nt|athene: east seems fated, whenever his partner opens 1nt, to have an 8-count|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3NT by north would be the best chance for game|pg||
nt|athene: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: use stayman, fail to find a fit, and go down in 2nt or 3nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but still the bid sh be alerted - Hungary is not the World :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this board will turn things around|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 3 10s this time.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|hedyg: lol Gabor|pg||
nt|athene: only two obvious losers (@CK @HA) but nothing like 11 winners|pg||
nt|athene: just @D @D @H to lose|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: if you ruff enough hearts the @C10 grows up for the defence's third trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: maybe the operator missed it|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes they get sloppy with their alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: or maybe they have done so earlier and now opps know so no need to keep alerting the same bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have to confess I don't understand the 3@s bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking... (can I have any chance on winning....) does´t seems so|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: best return|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|athene: a trump back now and declarer has to just concede two heart tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Balanced hand, lousy suit, good defensive values it doesn't seem right to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I just saw a revoke.... (pessanha ruffed the @d)|pg||
nt|ady: South has shown up with enough to suppose north has king of clubs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4509  György Szalay|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: the defence never get in to draw the third trump|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: declarer could just have played @CJ throwing spade, club ruff, @SK, spade to ace, spade ruff, for 10 sure tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Yes, down 3. Declarer did not get much right as you can imagine|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: 100%|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: wonder why he covered the 9@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|viren169: looks like 3N was made at the other table on board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: e/w can make 4 @h |pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Endplayed because of @d9 on the k.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3nt made on 12 in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: good prediction Gabor|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h by s.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Slam on a finesse. Opportunity for Gamax to take the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: might end sadly|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt shows 5+@ss, unlimited.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south started with @HAK and another and declarer crossed to dummy and played a diamond to the @D8 in approved fashion :)|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like splintering with an ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 4 @c is @h support and short in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: me neither...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D some flavour of Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: showing a decent 4(+) card spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: E can't move i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, 3NT can be most anything over 3@S, so no way Winkler could move|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT a it on the heavy side|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit|pg||
nt|ady: better limit his hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass would do that well.|pg||
nt|viren169: although I cant think of an alternative bid?!?!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is quite interesting to play but should come to 11 tricks i should think|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is wide-ranging over 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: that's what Ribeiro did|pg||
nt|athene: now all roads lead to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: same bidding in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 4@H is fine...|pg||
nt|athene: small spade lead is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Think will get a coffe ...|pg||
nt|athene: through the strong hands's fragment|pg||
nt|viren169: milk and sugar for me thks|pg||
nt|athene: hope for @SKJx in dummy (it's there) and @SQ with partner (unlucky)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: 22 is unusual|pg||

nt|cicus: W did not have much choice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: but not unreasonable with passed pd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: best|pg||

nt|ady: continue club|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s8|pc|d8|nt|xenya: tough after 3@S|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have doubled but what t bid over 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: poor lead when holding most of the outstanding values!|pg||
nt|viren169: need to attack here...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @DK might make things a bit harder for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so this is a Morten's Fork coup|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|nt|ady: still down 1    |pg||
nt|athene: it's just completely unnecessary as the @HA is right all along :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Even if 4NT is natural then (probably should be), you don't want to play there opposite nothing|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|santyclz: Or would be if n had the @ha.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @c is inverted minors|pg||
nt|ady: placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: bingo|pg||
nt|viren169: redbl|pg||
nt|athene: probably 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: if west passed the double, then north might redouble yes|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||
nt|viren169: I think West will bid 2/3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oops, too slow.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: interesting rebid, 2@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: light, very light 2 @s by Pinto|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||

nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||

nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: mayh go wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: it will guess wrong due to the "s bid I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|athene: north has to drop the @CA (the card he is known to hold) so that west doesn't know he can ruff another club with impunity|pg||

mb|3D|an|GF with 4+!D|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||

pc|sA|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: ok. once again thx all. See u tomorrow at 15.15 london time|pg||

nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: not yet... may be in the US!|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
