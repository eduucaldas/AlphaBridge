nt|mtvesuvius: West will open an 11-14 NT here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: well likley push here as every c ard right for e/w|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite a push by the Italians on the other room - making 3NT with 11 to 12|pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: good layout for a no problem 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, 9 or 10 tricks depending on the defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they will have to bid 3n now as east wont play in dims|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|mtvesuvius: 10 tricks now... push|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine because west cant risk the spade finesse after cashing the clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: now Macura may try to play @s A and @s   which is dangerous|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer is forced to finesse @s because he only have 8 top tricks after the @c suit will break|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, EW were sort of pushed to game by N's overcall -- not clear whether they would have got there if left to their own devices|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh miscounted yes he does so ten tricks after all|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, and losing to the K@S then the defense can switch to @d for -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless he plays north for a cannt duck after one round stands up|pg||
nt|tweety1: yep|pg||
nt|lestergold: canny duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: so only nine 'safe'|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @s finesse is forced upon declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and ducks in these situations are standard|pg||
nt|meikever: For all the information, articles, results and a forum to support the players you know http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match at http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57 (at the bottom)|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx Meike :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|tweety1: I guess @s finess after running the @c is the best line, however the declerer thinks the different lines I suppose.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @d switch beats it now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's lucky to escape now, because it's quite unlikely that S will switch to @d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but tough to find|pg||
nt|xenya: very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm i dont understand this line |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tweety1: still Macure did well, in case he played @s A  and @s  N cld have signalled @d.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: needed clubs to break even with spade tricks so surely should have played clubs first as much harder for north to underlead his akq od fimd at any point|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|d5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: but maybe he thought an early spade would lead to a heart continuation and in that respet it worked|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, but W did well not to allow for a potential @d signal|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer had to choose between the actual very friedly layout or the @S duck hoping for @Cs 3-3 and a likely (?) defencive error|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well west went for psychological rather than technical line he thought in this case that psychological was better than 50/50|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|lestergold: result vindicated it but i didnt like it because on run of clubs there was extra chance of the discard of a dim  etc|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|lestergold: especially when north held ks and needed to keep it guarded|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1NT was 8-11|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 1@c*|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: 2 @d was sthng asking shortness or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: could be headed for the lucky 3n as in the closed room|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|tweety1: oh ok|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: with 1NT being 8-11, West might be able to just bid 3NT now...|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite likely|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure i want to be in 3NT while seeing both hands, especially non-vul, when there's less reasons to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with 5 bagger|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: however it requires 4-4@h and a favorable lie in @c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: and because this is junior bridge they get lucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade lead? 10?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well not Qs|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess this play will be a lot faster and more stright-forward than the previous 3NT|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I certainly do :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Lucky hand... 5@c is off becuase of the K9x of @c, however 4@s makes on the favorable trump split|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is actually down|pg||
nt|yuval10: AK@c and @c ruff|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: however not really likely to lead @c from N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: if North can find the @c lead... :)|pg||
nt|xenya: in CR, W just jumped to 4@S after 1@C -- 1@D...|pg||
nt|yuval10: might say - highly unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dim bound to lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: @d is natural|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm whatever the result my great grandparents tauight me to lead singletons against suit contracts|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, i guess now we can be rest assure that Italians are leading attitude :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is fortunate the @HQ108 is just enough to stop him getting forced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How did Paparo guess to bid 4@S after  1@C  1@D   I wonder|pg||
nt|athene: well that was sort of natural bidding wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: well @Ss must be 3-3 for the contract to have a chance, so just 3 rounds of trumps now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the auction in closed is very 'junior' bridge|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess he never had partner with 1-5-6-1 against him .... then he play in 5-1 fir or 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 3x trumps but you also need the hearts to be just so, so you can't get forced|pg||
nt|athene: you have to lose the lead twice in clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: yes of course|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes... I can comfortably say that the CR auction is definitly Junior Bridge :)|pg||

nt|athene: but maybe i am completely wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: but when opps subside in 2c , then protective action can normally be taken|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: if you play bergen raises, what do you bid from South?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 3@C if I play inverted|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think i'd have upgraded my hand and bid 2NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: with 3 keycards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: but 4333|pg||
mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: I usually have a way to show a Bal. limit, however I like 2NT also b/c of the KCs and good spots|pg||
nt|yuval10: yep, but 3 keycards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well west wasnt being shut out by anhythinmg short of 4S!|pg||
nt|athene: i think 2NT is a bit of an overbid, facing a normal 2009 1@S opener|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west lucky that dummy has a massive club fit not to mention the 3/3 heart break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is with a 9 loser hand imo|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Facing a Junior opening, I would make a limit raise|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|mtvesuvius: A@D is onside, and declarer can pick up the @s suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 4s cold so the save would be fine against the game but the game wasnt bid in the closed|pg||
nt|athene: well, north with 5431 would be accepting a limit raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: i donno what's "normal 2009 1@s opener" is, but if i have 3 keycards and partner opened i expect to make a game :)|pg||
nt|athene: except in the other room, west's heart bid does make north very very unhappy about @Hxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north very unhappy about defending 4h too with xxx|pg||
nt|xenya: over bergen, opener will always raise to game with a shortage somewhere, so there is hardly any risk of missing game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's worth 11.25 on the K&R Hans Evaluator, so no more than a limit|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think that club ruff was a luxury hwe couldnt afford|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer hit a dead-end now|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have taken advantage of being in dummy with the @HA and led a diamond up earlier|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's always down then|pg||
nt|yuval10: W jumps with the A, play QJ@h and give p a @d ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: needed to get on with the dims- unlucky with the 4/0 breaqk but then was verylucky with the dim ace position and 3/3 break|pg||
nt|yuval10: (east discards his 2@d's )|pg||
nt|athene: yes :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: the point is that the club ruff was pointless|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|athene: if you led a diamond at trick 2 it's possible west might not find the defence|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't know all that much about north's hand|pg||

nt|yuval10: interesting hand, the final contract is very much depend on your system|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: E-W play something like Roman Club?|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe 10-13|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS play 15-17 NT and a Short @c, but I couldn't find the EW convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told 2@S = 5 spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes that's likely|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps a Fantunes-type system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 2 sp 9-13 5 spades 1 ha and 1 sp is 14 plus|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: everybody addopt some pages of Fantunes today? :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Like an EHAA type system?|pg||

mb|2N|an|both alerted|mb|p|nt|athene: 6-2 major-suit fits can be easy to miss|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: one hand doesn't quite have enough to insist on the suit, and the other doesn't have enough to raise it|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: these two-level openers are a double-edged sword...often they can pre-empt your own auction|pg||
nt|xenya: especially if you start a level higher than in ordinary systems|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like most of the field will play game here, after W will open 1@h|pg||
nt|athene: Fantoni-Nunes (who must be the most notable exponents of the style) have put a LOT of work into intricate relays after these bids, trying to squeeze the maximum possible exchange ...|pg||
nt|athene: of information out of the room available|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can actually make the contract, because of the favourable lay in @h ( JTX )|pg||

nt|yuval10: but that's double-dummy wise|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|mtvesuvius: North does best to duck this I think|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: @d to the Ace, Q@H and seeing the T@H declarer can play another @h|pg||
nt|athene: the most obvious way to play seems to be to come to hand and set off on hearts and just hope for something good in one of the red suits|pg||
