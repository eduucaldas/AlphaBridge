mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcmax: this seems to be round of the major 2-suiters....|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: most experts use a 4-level bid to show at least 5-5 in the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: and it seems to me I would generally prefer to play the contract from the NT hand because of potential lead advantages|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: 4s basically very good contract only off wehn spade finesse is wrong and  hearts either wrong or you guess them wrong|pg||

nt|lestergold: more than 50% because always makes when spade finesse is on|pg||
nt|jcmax: also it makes it more difficult for your opponents toenter the bidding in case they have a huge minor suit fit|pg||

nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Bob Heitzman and Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi bob|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|idblu: hi all from chilly Toronto, Canada :)|pg||
nt|idblu: welcome back all :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|idblu: Tony, Mike, Al, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW for Scotland are Frazer Morgan and Phillip Morrison|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: both students at St Andrews university|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong NT from north|pg||
nt|cindy: very strong  meaty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS got too ambitious in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c-2n-3@c-p is a sensible auction assuming inverted|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might be the final contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E leads a D against 3NT -- the 8 or 9 for preference -- W will have to shift to a low spade right away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brrr|pg||
nt|mamos: South is not well placed when it comes to making an opening lead|pg||
nt|mamos: it would be great if someone could tell us the scores|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: PB England 50 (2), Scotland 29 (2), Wales 26 (2) Northern Ireland 10 (1), ROI 0 (1)|pg||
nt|cindy: could be dont|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or i guess even the Q will do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too bad, cuter if low spade necessary|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit?|pg||
nt|mamos: Catherine (Evans) and Eve Hatfield are the WElsh North South|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good hand for west|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT BY E|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North for Scotland is Jun Nakamaru-Pinder|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: vugraph just catching up|pg||
nt|mamos: one trick gone after q@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the club suit may go jack, king, ace, queen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: SORRY FOLKS WILL CATCH UP NEXT E ROLLING IN TRICKS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Tom Paske and Graeme Robertson playing for England|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT+1|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Kath|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: well judged on the cards ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey folks|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS here are ladies|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike, Kath, Cliff, Fred and Tony|pg||
nt|mamos: this cant be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can only assume Frazer intends 2 hearts as forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi Mike Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Kath and Mike :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some scores here: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not up to date |pg||
nt|mamos: NO:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: FYI, N-S are ladies, so please remember "she"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hurray|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North South are 2 ladies  hurray|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: thatÂ´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
nt|idblu: I think we probably will be in for some youthful exuberance...if I can go back to my own youthful bidding days :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: so these are the under 25s here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm more experienc might suggest to young Jones that on a weak hand with a six card spade suit, it is generally better to rebid the spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Scotland doing pretty well from the results i see, not sure how current|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Catherine and Eve|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|eggy: ah - or pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not for me if it was 4315 (@c6 is a heart)|pg||
nt|april7: NS play weak NT so DONT not possible|pg||
nt|daman: that too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: winning play by declarer after a good auction|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: or pass 1S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|cindy: can play for overtricks now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: anyway 2@H is going to survive with perhaps an imp to Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not @d10 in trick2?|pg||
nt|cindy: good question|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless E bid 1 spade on a get your retaliation in first principal, but this may be two high..|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idblu: ge Roland :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|capercliff: these ruffs actually help declarer in a way|pg||
nt|capercliff: but the A@h was an error|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so may get through|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cindy: four pitches will be painful for E|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole. Welcome to you|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eggy: really?|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Helen|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||
nt|mamos: should probably make from here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|idblu: home now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT seems normal though|pg||

mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: i love the slight uinderstatement Sabine|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have to remember this is junior bridge|pg||
nt|jcmax: it appears NS bid to 3NT and west saved in 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom on a big scale as 3n can be defeated|pg||

nt|mamos: up|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: 3NT looks a more likely contract|pg||
nt|mamos: well England off to the fast start their previous record in the competition suggested they might|pg||
mb|2C|nt|april7: another partscore @S fpr EW and @H NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS?|pg||
nt|cindy: would be kind of pushy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other names dont sound Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what west wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 4@H  non vul :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i do too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but Northern Ireland played well last match for a good win|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 2 ladies NS in other room for N ireland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi mike|pg||
nt|idblu: hi mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: none of the other three are backward when it comes to bidding|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting jump shift in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 mikes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure of their ages, maybe girls?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when does a girl become a woman :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall !|pg||
nt|bobh1: set the auction up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is allowable at green but will not get a great result this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Here is Mike... he will know the scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Helen, could you please enter result on 13 manually?|pg||
nt|mamos: England are playing Wales in their final match but we don't know the relative scores of England Scotland and NI|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: well we arent results merchants, most of us like the bid|pg||
nt|mamos: another possible game swing here|pg||
nt|benjy: He recently got engaged so he should be able to maintain his concentration|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: here we'll probably see 4sf etc|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, sadly Scotland missing 3 games|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Mini Paske will bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's a racy double of  1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: England have bid 4@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh they play strong @c in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: whats the over/under   for undertricks?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a heart lead may cause problems, but North is unlikely to find it here after the 1@H opening |pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here with 13 is an aggressive calll|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like at least 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
nt|mamos: hi ben|pg||
nt|benjy: Any thoughts on the lead? You could easily argue for a trump lead (my choice), dummy could have a ruffing value|pg||
nt|mamos: racy I couldn't possibly comment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that we don't have an updated ranking, but England has won the Peggy Bayer (U20) by a large margin, and the English U25s are also in a strong position to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now where will Ms Nash look for tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a maker now........... lead of small @D might have worked if led|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
nt|cindy: 4 now|pg||
nt|idblu: inverted minors...2@C game forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, @SK |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: It's Norma!|pg||
nt|mamos: I guess it's Catherine and Eve EW for Wales|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently 4n is RKC in @c's|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie in a friendly way so no probs|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep, would have been a lot in 6@c as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with clubs 3-2, this should be no problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: We will get the right player names eventually; pls be patient|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: a poor switch why on earth does he want to ruff when he has natural trump tricks?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S looked 100%|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -2 it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's enjoying himself|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: NS ontrack here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: five star contract!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: watching poor east suffer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: don't understand this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: ac is reasonable a dim is reasonable a spade to the K is reasoanble but why has he plasyed the 2c??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see an upside to this play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think David Franklin is our operator now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: even if East responded to B/Wood :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bidding diagram is missing a couple of passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Whoever it is will be quite pleased to have an easy contract to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Thanks Kerry says Boyd|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wilkinsona: 2 spades a bit pessimistic it seems from north this time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff: not that it is really biddable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no it didnt seem obvious|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats right Cliff, bid 'em up|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 opposite 12...need the hand records to bid 6 :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: another profit for NS|pg||
nt|cindy: think so ?  partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Claim 12 tricks before anything happens!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: 5sx escaped for 1 down and they defended 5C in open room|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Not important here, but as a metter of general tchnique you should aleays try to retain entries to both hands in trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: pitching @H now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: 2@s is too weak For me 3 possibilities. pass for penalty, 2nt or 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S does not open, N does not like his hand for game, especially with a lot wasted in hearts. maybe he would pass out the double at matchpoints, but even then EW are nonvul, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has a stiff stpade it could be ugly for NS (esp. if S has spade ace)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, north also had a option of playing in 2 hearts x |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|mariner1: no @D?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4 8s here|pg||
nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: I am told that England are 10 VPs ahead of NI in the Junior Camrose before the last round. England playing against Wales|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: S tries to go down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: and the K@d is waste paper:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: East probably ought to have risked 2@s, but that's the kind of action that comes with experience|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to play it out, it is MANDATORY to discard the jack of diamonds on the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: she's going to be endplayed in a minute|pg||

nt|jcmax: in the closed room south raised his partner's 1@S response to 2@S on 3-card supported. And apparebtly N expected a full-bloodied 4-card raise, because he lept all the way to game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcmax: I would consider pass of 1@S totally normal considering the 3rd hand opening|pg||

nt|cindy: 2@hx would scare me at IMPs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an option, but perhaps not an attractive one facing heart shortness. he can't count on more than 100, and may not get that, so why not just take an easy plus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's not like S rates to have Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: find it surprising that 4n is both intended and interpreted as RKC but they landed on their feet for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let W think for a few seconds that E has the diamond ace. then cash it. life's little pleasures|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess it was undo|pg||
nt|idblu: what systems are these pairs playing?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Norma :)|pg||
nt|mamos: with the 2-2 break EW can get home in 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well, gird up the loins girls!|pg||
nt|mamos: Richard and Brian had a tough time in the last match against Wales so perhaps this start will make them feel better!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i dont know, are they on ecats?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Partner said D and not 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: NSmight fall off their horse in 4@Sx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
nt|april7: 4th hand might balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pleased to here all of you defend Norths action at the table|pg||
nt|idblu: not strong NT n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might make a 3N here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe that's @H and a minor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht cannot get to dummy to take the club finesse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: so he will be reduced to cashing the ace, with fortuitous results|pg||
nt|mamos: EW played 4@H in OR but North looks favourite to make 1NT  funny old game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, a passed hand should not reopen with D there without 4 spades|pg||
nt|idblu: it's been suggested that n/s are playing ACOL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a "do something sensible partner" double?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS don't appear to have a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing is the issue here to bring in the 9th trick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont fancy it really|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: OR Scotland did get to game, but 4 hearts a difficult contract with handling problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will do OK on a club lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@DX prob their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s can be made double dummy - it can also easily be misdefended-a dim two ruffs and two hearts are easy for the defence but they will not necessarily also come tio a lub trick a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: club may go away on the third heart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant believe O'rourke is thinking |pg||
nt|capercliff: Phil and Frazer are a young Scottish pair, but have ben playing together for some years in fact|pg||
nt|benjy: e/w have a cheap save 500 if the defense take their ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: save would have been cheap|pg||
nt|mamos: or not:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: 9 tricks look easy with the @D hook and a @H|pg||
nt|benjy: some might have overcalled 3@S with 64 shape at this vul|pg||
nt|chick: was it Larry Cohen who said, "I've spent my life bidding 4@S over 4@H" ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that solid 6-card @s suit 4@s is a master contract. Yes I see AKQJ10 as a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|mamos: West seems to have been a little passive here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: king is better|pg||
nt|mamos: still has seven tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps after some hearts west will allow a club finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps...... |pg||
nt|mamos: pick up diamonds?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but the defence may be difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: might as well keep on leading @s|pg||
nt|mamos: well bod|pg||
nt|mamos: bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear he should seriously downgrade his diamond holding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: O'Rourke overbid here|pg||
nt|mamos: well it was always a likely outcome|pg||
nt|idblu: this doesn't play well....but on values s/b in game |pg||
nt|mamos: I once asked Martin Jones about a 4@S bid by the late great John Collings over 4@H and Martin said John's philosophy was to bid 4@S and then look at his hand :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: low @c is clear now|pg||
nt|mamos: @cx |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and equally clear to go up|pg||
nt|bobh1: so maybe it's right to cash the A|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N will make on lie of the cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and 3NT may be difficult to defeat|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: doesn't always work, of course|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play for the max!|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 24 combined points but very flat hands ghame not at all attratcive|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems odd that the singleton bids clubs and the 7-card clb suit bids hearts - I guess that is the modern game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mamos: lol of course not but it's not always easy for the other side to know what to do|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
nt|chick: would be interesting to know the specific meanings of those bids |pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||
nt|april7: if short suit trial was possible in saystem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to eggy|pg||
nt|eggy: hI EVERYONE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actiually, couldn;t it be right to lead another heart? how does S know the diamonds are running? and N could have much better sopades|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth could afford K@D first|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: now the defence have burnt a trick ltho conmtract still one off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: East realised he had 2 entries to set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I'm guessing 2@H is a 3-card limit raise, and 4@C a cue|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd guess 2@H was a 3 card raise to 2@S but don't really know|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, one feels West might chance a double|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: smal @H|pg||
nt|idblu: chance for many now|pg||
nt|mamos: unpleasant moment for South|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: north gave it back he should never cover the JH|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: at this vul 7@S is unlikely to be worse than a few imps away defending 7@H risks a bucketfu|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: l|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to play big @D 1st|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bad news now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more imps to England, but really this should have made|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: yawn|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Unfortunately fighting with connection probs in Belfast|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: 24 points seems the norm for bidding games at imps these days|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: except N could have knocked out club K and take @h finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, could we please have the correct player names up?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We still have English and Northern Irish from the previous match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: I got nothing (as they say)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|daman: claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe West is the one who needs to do all the bidding for her partnership - if so, we could be in for a bumpy ride|pg||
nt|daman: -2|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|sA|nt|daman: youthful exuberance|pg||
nt|idblu: now @C to lose as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north has try tghe double club finesse but he will moreliekly play one round of clubs to see if an honour drops from w|pg||

nt|lestergold: as cards lie looks like N/S can make a very dodgy 6 spades here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcmax: But would you really play West for the singleton @SK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would normally predict a flat board here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but im too frightened to in this company|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: no|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: 4@S does indeed look like an extremely normal contract. And it doesn't seem like EW can do anything to prevent their opponents from getting there.|pg||

nt|dburn: and you lot are simply resulting - what North-South did on this board was fine, and so was what East-West did|pg||
nt|mamos: ah glad David is here he'll like the NS auction on this one|pg||
nt|eggy: well at least this way you made EW guess if they could make 7|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out   this might be exciting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid at these colors facing a 3rd seat opener seems overly ambitious. unless there is something about the 1C opener i am not aware of |pg||
nt|lestergold: -2|pg||
nt|idblu: how young are these juniors?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be nice to know yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: we might see some exciable bidding hefre|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone know ages?|pg||
nt|capercliff: seem to have lost a trick or 2 there|pg||
nt|mamos: we have nothing|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure you|pg||
nt|chick: you're right about the 2@H bid, but then what do you do if you have a good heart hand?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kerri, i beg her pardon :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the competition is Under 25 not sure the ages of these players|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: Cards laying ok for NS|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I don't like double|pg||
nt|eggy: what was it Mike?|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward, this|pg||
nt|bobh1: was tough to avoid 6@c in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H doesnt feel like enough to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: here they are exerting less pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: Dbl   hehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quite a bit of difference between teenagers and 24 year olds|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should bid 4H in my uiew|pg||
nt|mamos: I know what do you do with a good Diamond hand .... etc|pg||
nt|chick: you think they are playing transfer advances?|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure |pg||
nt|mamos: what will South make of this?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting problem for South. Anyone expecting a discplined Pass from our Junior?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 8 card suit is not a takeout double|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll have to bid at 5 level soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he must think X and then bid @H is better to describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: EW need to be careful to check winners as well as losers here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jones like to open 1C. or else he has a defective bidding box|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry   im a @d bidder with E hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South does not have a clear action|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s can make but to bid it is another story|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for South|pg||
nt|mamos: had better pass :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: maybe it could, but it would seem normal to arrive in only 3@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be 6 spades is on though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he isv ulnerable he needs a goodish hand to overcall 4h itys not too good for that bid|pg||
nt|chick: double for the spades, then correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: pass on s???|pg||
nt|mamos: NS played in their 3-0 fit after West had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why didnÂ´t S bid 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: they don't play drury for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: still will be hard to stay out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knows he has to bid @H at the  5 level eventually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see the point of 1@S |pg||
nt|benjy: 1@S is madness|pg||
nt|chick: not do I|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have a perfectly respectable club suit|pg||
nt|mamos: surely going to land her in 4@S|pg||
nt|benjy: you have a 5 card suit and you want partner to lead a @C|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
nt|april7: EW should stay in a decent @D partscore and NS should stay out of bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. can;t imagine passing|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm sure that's his intent, but this is the wrong type of hand for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they wwere always bidding at least 4s in any case|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has shown his partner a good hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually not good as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom and Dom are more coservative than most juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: conservative|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor does North, although...|pg||
nt|bobh1: blakwood not that helpful|pg||
nt|mamos: Blackwood with xx ???|pg||
nt|cindy: thats not a surprise is it ?|pg||
nt|idblu: major suits ultra favourable|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some partnerships agree never to pre-empt when they are playable in the other major - except when they do|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|april7: W now 3@D and thats it|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|daman: he will bid 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: desaster in 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: old fashioned Culbertson asking bid! |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in @H not good|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5h doubled only 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Im for 6 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that lead 6s made|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
nt|dburn: double may have been more major-suit oriented - 2@c would not be such a good idea if North were 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|daman: passing is not an option|pg||
nt|april7: or even worse|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i could show both suits by specifying them right away, i might--certainly if NV i would. here i like  1D|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservative  new bridge adjective|pg||
nt|benjy: if fiona was my partner i would call the director and have the psyche recorded in an attempt to stop her from doing it in the future|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a make :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: well done whatever it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, spades are 3-3 and the queen is onside|pg||
nt|chick: not a bad agreement to have|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: more optimistic than that George :)|pg||
nt|cindy: it does make 4S i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I donÂ´t expect 3@cD be the final contract, I must bid 3@h on S|pg||
nt|cindy: and 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does it mean when you can't act over 1C, but you can act over a jump-rebid facing a passed partner when opps are unlimited but also have not shown a fit?|pg||
nt|mamos: my typoingis carp|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: what would you have him do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or well-guessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E cannot afford to double|pg||
nt|cindy: a guess i think|pg||
nt|dburn: bid 4@s, perhaps?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes on any lead perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade lead?|pg||
nt|idblu: also|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and west should surely bid 4 hearts over the splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: @D on @C and ruff 3 @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well may need a diamond hook|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in a good spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eggy: still 1 back to Ireland it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: 11|pg||
nt|dburn: as well he might have been|pg||
nt|chick: it's not a psyche, lots of ppl bid 3 card spade suits in desperation.   this wasn't one of those times, though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has a 10 count, why should he cue bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: I used to bid like that when I was their age :)|pg||
nt|april7: its actually easy to lead ace and another @D with those @S cards|pg||
nt|daman: Smolski still bids like that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm sure I was worse but this is really just out of control|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be asking about @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: and @CKQ not looking good opposite splinter|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Goren says add five for a void after a fit is found|pg||
nt|yo_yo: exactly|pg||
nt|mamos: @D |pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: Roland will agree that young players may be affected by bad board|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|capercliff: there will be a @s entry in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bobh1: agree, the N hand is a little strong tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t know what itÂ´s called in english, but 4@h was an asking bid for control in @h|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure Or score is correct  I thought it was 2@Dx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H was an interesting choice - certainly might have tried 2@D first |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland seem to have judged well to bid 3 hearts here|pg||
nt|benjy: she can't play trumps now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CA, @H ruff, @CK for @H discard, @S|pg||
nt|benjy: but will get home if she leads diamonds from the top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, that too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Thinking cap on|pg||
nt|mamos: West trying telepathy  ?  It never works for me   this time it did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Diamond seesm marked - even if partner has another club trick it cannot be right to play a club.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: i don't think that is clear. just because S didnt make a neg double doesnt mean he cant have 4 spades|pg||
nt|capercliff: to play a @h again|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the swings are starting to go the other way and what was a big English lead is down to a handful|pg||
nt|april7: at least now @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess (s)he was wondering which diamond to play - wnet for count card|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: our experts coments on board 2 justified by the score, as 4 spades went off open room on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Competently done|pg||
nt|chick: @CQ and another club could promote a trump trick for E|pg||
nt|mamos: thirteenth Club will complete the job|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|mamos: ok now well done|pg||
nt|benjy: no problems now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not only do we have to guess the systems, but also the gender with wrong names up|pg||

nt|mariner1: so making a nice 4|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: I agree with anything you say, Victor|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: the cards actually don't lie so badly for 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: n.s might limp home iwth this but they would have rather defended|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcmax: If the defenders lead trumps all the time declarer can set up the diamond suit|pg||
nt|jcmax: and if they don't play trumps declarer can ruff a @H in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite easy to go off here altho on thuis lead if spades are held to only one loser and dims can be developed to take car of a club loser etc- might nmanage this onw |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: problem is one of entries and communications a lot of  work to do|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|jcmax: it looks to me ducking a @D now would be a good idea|pg||

nt|jcmax: declarer would probably have been better off not inserting the @CJ from dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the defence would still have worked|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcmax: let's say he had put up the @CA from dummy and played a trump. what would West do?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|mamos: neither pair seemed to get to grips with their values on Board 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This was a typical hand where you must act early. otherwise you are out-bidden|pg||
nt|cindy: first few hands have been interesting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S on that last hand, it would be useful to play that D by N shows three good hearts. since N did not rebid 1S and has a jump-rebiddablke suit in a good offensive hand on this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction, not a great idea to play it for penalty|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  thats true too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 4S should either be natural or a cue, by agreement|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know what it's called in English either|pg||
nt|idblu: we are all resulting here...in real life how many pairs would really get to 6 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens KQ clubs is enuf to ensure 6s cold with dim k onside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one, looking at xxx in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not a good slam really|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean hardly a biddable slam|pg||
nt|mamos: probably imps to England because contract was 2@D doubled in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Helen|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok so a semi-nice 3 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice 3 I think :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S normal here but unlucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still doesn't excuse the 1@S bid, imho |pg||
nt|mamos: I think many people think Fiona has a great future in the Women's game|pg||
nt|mamos: well in the game full stop|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: did E really made it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but perhaps also a win. 4@s is laydown|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H shows a desire to get the opponents into a thin game while telling them how to make it|pg||
nt|idblu: agree|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise for south|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably 2h some sort of weak 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: souith seriously fixed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H? Gosh|pg||
nt|chick: why not a great future in ALL games?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|idblu: double would work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree Marshall. 4@s must be a cue with @d support|pg||
nt|mamos: i got there first|pg||
nt|chick: lol  yes, you did :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idblu: e/w will find their @D now|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but what will n/s who have the balance of points fiind?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: looks a good wjo to me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not an overcall that you would want to show the children|pg||
nt|mamos: getting old Mike ?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: missed a pass operator|pg||
nt|petergill: A Pass By North is missing|pg||
nt|dburn: rubbish|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont know what I would have bid as South|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Very difficult after that bidding by EW|pg||
nt|idblu: fixed|pg||
nt|idblu: by system|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I would have overcalled in NT... but maybe thats not a success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's amazing what a few -800's do for you|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: Philip? East 2@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that opener but it worked for N ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: south can bid 3h over 3d which should be to play in hearts|pg||
nt|idblu: now we're stretching|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a bit high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NI stopped in 2NT on  3 - 11 to England|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: talking of thin games...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a bit too many... sac against 2 spades EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North was just competing but South thought invitational maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That looks a brave raise opposite 15-17, so maybe they play a wider range|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Each side had now propelled itself to a higher level than they needed to be at.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Makes it a tough game!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thing beginning to happen now re player names|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have them all - thanks operator|pg||
nt|mamos: game had play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H should come in and possibly 4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: what would North do with a 5=1=1=6 shape?|pg||
nt|benjy: 3NT is the practical bid on values but i would be worried about not showing my @C, with only Axx in @S it is not clear that 3NT is the correct spot|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: hard to believe that NS, looking at dummy, couldn't understand how important it was to play trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have leant on 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: I might have unsheathed the red card|pg||
nt|april7: X???|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever partner's 2NT meant I seem to have some good defensive cards|pg||
nt|daman: yes   double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E must falsecard with a top heart|pg||
nt|idblu: N didn't have any tries, other than double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: But south had already bid her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do  we know what NT they play at this vul?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: according to steve robinson, open 1@s|pg||
nt|dburn: Nothing "must" be a cue bid if it can be natural|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: I have 4 tricks in my hand and my partner has competed red to the 3 level???  I whack 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: 3 dpwn and no X?!|pg||
nt|bobh1: but most others would often open 1@c depending on suit quality|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done by North to drop the @C109|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: it is a matter of agreements, david. you can go either way on the agreement, depending on what you think will be most useful to the partnership. i don;t care either way here, but i ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will observe that 5116 doesnt get dealth all that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1 off at best, beatig 140 I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we ladies get nervous about doubling|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: The poor defence to 5@D and a doomed 3NT in the open reverses the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: well declarer ok now if picks up Clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 8 tricks now unless she takes a first round club finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: with the young players, you have to expect the unexpected|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|eggy: maybe an imp here at most|pg||
nt|idblu: asking for @C...|pg||
nt|mamos: East needs to play @d|pg||
nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly if 2@H is NF and West can pass 3@C  |pg||
nt|benjy: i very much doubt that|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer could easily play a @S to the Q here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idblu: I have a secret to tell you...so do we men :)|pg||
nt|idblu: or is that wee men|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec points out that 3N NS has play, but the spade bids did for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes they did  that's result merchanting|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like the somnambulist coup |pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: in 20 years we will forget all of this|pg||
nt|mamos: should be ok which ever way she plays|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: break in the excitement- time for a little refreshment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: well done ben|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|benjy: and now it looks like she is down on a @S return as long as the defense are careful|pg||
nt|benjy: a @H return would do as well|pg||
nt|chick: true, but not as clear ... her pard bid spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Fiona thinking long and hard!|pg||
nt|benjy: i cannot think of a case where a @S return is not correct. But it is always best to check!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Richard Boyd - Brian Sharkey  vs  Catherine Evans - Eve Hatfield|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|mamos: These are two relatively small countries with only a few young players |pg||
nt|daman: amazing|pg||
nt|april7: but we all learn from our mistakes hopefully|pg||
nt|daman: ducking the @C was weak|pg||
nt|idblu: @D Q will still score|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: still 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: would seem to be more useful as a cuebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats stops the endplay|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eggy: although perhaps not enough entries for all teh ruffs now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 1 results: JC Wales-Scotland 14-16; England -Ireland 16-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade very unattractive play contract shouldstill go off |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: well bidding and making 4 hearts is quite a coup on this lot|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: if S played the @H King at trick 1, North would not have ducked the @C  I'm sure|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing neither way, as some poet remarked|pg||
nt|mamos: Ian Jones enjoying himself here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|idblu: can't help but go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should of course play club and leave declarer tio do his own swork|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not opeing !NT on that South hand unless it shows 18 points|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: one more board at this table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N had to win on the hand!|pg||
nt|mamos: he was :(    hush my mouth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too much elation about the king of hearts falling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good comment received about 3@H. Bit of a methods tester - is double take-out or penalties, and is a bid of 3@S forcing or not?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: in fact she makes 9 by ducking a spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: but i agree that if you do NOT have a clear agreement, the old default principle is best: "if it COULD be natural, we shouyld both assume it is natural"|pg||
nt|mamos: Is "rubbish" Parliamentary language?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the house of commons|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: Good morning everyone|pg||

nt|mamos: thank you Oliver|pg||
nt|daman: the bland leading the bland|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: notice played the slam hand in 6Hx OR|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: I always think we should have a joker "Could I try that trick again" we all have that sinking feeling when we've done something silly  :(  it's tough when you are being watched|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so E will not be punished for failure to play 9 or 10 of hearts on first round (though that might not work anyway--still it is important to make those plays just to keep in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: practice)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Steve, welcome|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: PB Wales-Scotland 6-24; England-Ireland 25-0  NI Sat out|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: England take the lead with 5 hearts +1 board 4 OR|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jcmax: In the closed room S bid 2@C over the t/o double and N rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: apparently in the other room north declinded his partners offer to play in his long club suit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcmax: That makes me believe the 2@C bid over the double must have been forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: this south has been a little bolder than  his counterpart who only bid 2c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|jcmax: which I would consider unusual, but I guess it is possible to play that way|pg||
nt|jcmax: it has become quite common to play transfer bids after 1M opening when the opponents interfere with double|pg||

nt|dburn: 4@h? Well, I suppose they had more trumps than their opponents, but even so...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
nt|idblu: @H suits abound in this event it appears|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so North couldnt judge to go on |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or not|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: yes, that is likely to haunt him for a while|pg||

nt|daman: 3NT is for the club allstars|pg||
nt|april7: W must be careful not to go to 6NT|pg||
nt|mamos: and to marshall and cindy and Bob and David and ralf for their commebts|pg||
nt|idblu: is this a KO event, swiss ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you i dont like that 2@C bid|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy not much help this loks likely to fail|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Kelsey once said - avoid Axxx against no-tump. Right here, diamonds works better|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a good hand yet has losers so no game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: still, his actual effort might work pretty well|pg||
nt|mamos: a tricky hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Well tricky to get over the hand I meant :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes ralf in 3@H in the OR declarer did test Clubs|pg||
nt|idblu: round robin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a round robin|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north must be chaffing at the bit with that monster |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2@D bid might excite O'Rourke|pg||
nt|mariner1: S not counting her losers enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: unlikely that NS will bid this 10%- game, so a narrow win for England|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there you go|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have bid a lot of clubs even at this vulnerability with good 8 card suits you at least must take up the oppos bidding space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Somerville stayed strangely silent on this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is not a bad spot, but can go down on a @d ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: well 2@S works|pg||
nt|mamos: worked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is this a steal by EW?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - nothing much of anything makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is Ruth showing the minors ?  It doesnt look strong enough for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: next session in twenty minutes or so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will east balance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensibly not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to the operator for showing us all four hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|idblu: and such a strong playing hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha enter dopi and ropi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or podi and pori|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if they know their ropis/dopis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cue for all round disaster|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt sure which suit North is interested in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well obviously dont play rkc |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North cant really bid again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neither can South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: remarkable as David Coleman would have said :)|pg||
nt|april7: this time not a wrong prediction by me|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since West has shown already that she is not backward in coming forward|pg||
nt|april7: with @S fonesse even 6 NT, I miscounted before|pg||
nt|dburn: be honest now - how many of you lot could get to 6@c in four bids?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may have competed with 3 spades here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually correct technique on 2-suiters where there is work to be done to attend to the side suit before trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think this will make|pg||
nt|mamos: and apologies for my typing   thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for making us welcome and BBO for bringing this broadcast to us all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North find the @DK lead?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but the lead..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: pass is 1|pg||
nt|idblu: everybody has it marked on their card...but when it comes up :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south hasnt a clue |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks ok, Mike|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe but not far from 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: Thats the trouble with that 2@C bid, usually agrees @S|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|april7: only the youth|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if W holds off till 3rd trump play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: results will be posted here http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|idblu: or is P 1st step|pg||
nt|eggy: Still looks a trick short|pg||
nt|mamos: NS may be a little over excited at the thought of a big win and an englisg disaster but they wont get them like this|pg||
nt|mariner1: a little too much aggression here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has the dreaded multi found more victims|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: pass shows 1 inexperience playing in our 4/4 fit when you have a solid 7 card suit elsewhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now to negotiate the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right contract it seems as 5 hearts is off on the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: amd 5d off if they find the ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H goes down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 5h unlucky does go ionm the ruff andf5f makes but normally this should be plaed in hearts if we are not result merchants|pg||
nt|idblu: and of course we are not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you eating your words there Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Norths 2C bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|lestergold: eating which words|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think maybe both 5d and 5h are both going down|pg||
nt|idblu: ty Helen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: So there may be an adjustment as they were told it ws nat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: East was no longer sure all his Clubs were actually Clubs???|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: but perhaps declarer can pick teh spade suit?|pg||
nt|eggy: will take an exceptional read tough I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: GREAT YAWNS FROM W!  LATE NIGHT?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: S king was a good card by W--not so easy for N to count W's poinmts|pg||
nt|idblu: that is not the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead surely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think EW were damaged|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C is a cue...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: any lead it makes as East only has 1 trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I am surprised the Irish boys dont know the unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: then when trumps are played take third diamond and play club leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: Morrison will draw trumps and hope the @C run?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: making six (but West would lead @DK against a slam)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes a diamond would have been better from North again|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably still survives|pg||
nt|idblu: but still makes,,,has @H entry|pg||
nt|mamos: even 5@C cannot make so maybe not a real disaster|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eggy: I know strong club pairs who couldn't get there in 20 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: No, it;s still early in the morning  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should duck the trumph lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: very strange auction|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould since i can see all four hands|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North cannot tell what is happening in hearts.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match:  Northern Ireland v Wales (Junior Camrose)|pg||
nt|mamos: and contract back to making now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to win and guess diamonds - play for split aces?|pg||
nt|mamos: if declarer can guess DiaMONDS|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: W still need @S finesse|pg||
nt|daman: well    1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 4@C might be an auction that would impel us to slam|pg||
nt|eggy: not the best practioners of that black art it's true|pg||
nt|idblu: not now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idblu: @D9 promoted|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: I think the next session is 8pm uk time two hours 20 minutes check for local times and shout now if I've got it wrong|pg||
nt|cindy: iwas wondering why im always right|pg||
nt|dburn: almost no one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ItÂ´s a kind of safety play with the actual @d-holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: off now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: rather tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Wales knocked 3N OR for a big swing board 15|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eggy: shipped teh spae suit but got it back :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: it might, but 3@c would not be forcing for the majority of players in this competition|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  Mini Paske (so known because Ben his older brother is Maxi Paske is always looking half asleep  and then at his most dangerous|pg||
nt|eggy: and now a diamond will greak communication|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 promoted|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: North isn't going to like this hand even though it isn't his fault|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not too often we get trick one safety plays in 2S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but let us see!|pg||
nt|cindy: most players dont think long enough at trick one to even consider it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i usually save them for slams. to hold it to down one|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - it's a safety play to guaretee going down one in a laydown contract|pg||
nt|idblu: poor dummy play |pg||

nt|jcmax: If NS can find a way to get there they could pick up a highly needed swing for Belgium|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we didnt like the bidding in closed room  (so commented) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sabine Auken (jcmax) and Marion Michielsen had a very successful partnership for Europe in the Buffett Cup last autumn in USA. How much system talk did you have time for, Sabine?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: we simply decided to play the same system as the whole europe team was playnig in the individual.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i would expect n/s to compete to 3h in any case and probably for north to suggest a good hiding if the third spade reares its head|pg||
nt|jcmax: at least that way we could play the same system the whole tournament.)|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south must make another ffort surely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: didnt in closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: here comes the charge of the light briggade|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes the cannons have been fired|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in to the v alley of death rode the 600|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: this is more of the red bloodied stuff we like to see from these young hopefuls|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcmax: meaning on the 2nd @H S would play a high @H to ask for a @H switch and a low one to ask for a @C switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: fairly normal Sabine gicen that pard knows how many hearts he has|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will only lose one spade trick so thats 2 off buty doubled is a fair number of imps away|pg||

nt|lestergold: a v good wuestion|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: yes the 10 was played!|pg||
nt|jcmax: that was unfortunate|pg||
nt|lestergold: burnt what could have been a trick of value at least in theory|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: as it happens the discard wouldnt help as north would ruff and still have a trump trick|pg||

nt|cindy: ty roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a sensible ruling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope Adams wasnt put off with the director called|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S 1@C 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: will NS bid 4@S|pg||
nt|eggy: I think South did well to throw a spade in a way, as declarer might have read the suit otherwise|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps a slightly more straightforward board|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here though someone could be shoved up into one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: 4@H and 5@D with @H finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: I WAS TOO INTERESTED IN SCORES STOPPED WATCHING :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|mamos: There are two competitions this is U25 - Junior Camrose and the Peggy Bayer U20|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps West should have played the hearts from dummy anyway as if N ducked the HA, it wouldn;t have helped|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N decides to scrpe a bid yes|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd bid 2@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: scrape*|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The play ended, not sure what happened|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: and 3NT with no finesses at all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: awkward bid now for Sharkey|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: let's hope EW get in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: but with clubs 2-2, there were enough entries to not need the spade finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all ty Helen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi again Cindy|pg||
nt|mamos: not not not 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: appears to have claimed one off when she could have made :(|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps misguessed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Peggy B - Eng 175, Scot 118, Wales 83, Nor Irl 45 and Irel 33|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I doubt that - I think the opreator dropped behind the play, it happenes to the best of us|pg||
nt|mamos: even you LIz  ?:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: but now it can be difficult to find|pg||
nt|april7: good lead but W has a chnace for 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|capercliff: a NT never came to mind|pg||
nt|mamos: scrpe was better|pg||
nt|eggy: a splinter now should dampen any possible enthusiasm|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C would be my choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: 4@H a mile off anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start by NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion E is too passive afre 1@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hardly a mile - but 4H is 1 down|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi mike, ralf|pg||
nt|mamos: calmer hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well o'rourke and Adams should brush up on Unassuming cue bids before the next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play 2/1 maybe that's their system|pg||
nt|capercliff: intended as forcing I gather|pg||
nt|mamos: but then 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Q for a make it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be slightly nervous playing 3NT on this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CQ would be a good lead here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet North finds it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I cannot tell a lie.... even me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: but an interesting choice to not correct to 4@s holding a singelton|pg||
nt|eggy: that even more so :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: YES!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: what a player|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S pretty conservative partner did not have to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: cunning lead|pg||
nt|eggy: Tom Paske is a tricky player, as you can see from the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: S's 1@D a warning here.......|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm pretty sure I'd end in the losing 4@S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes with the 3@C call it would be hard to avoid now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I would have done the inviting with the East hand, not the West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both boys hoping the other has shortage in @C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: hi Mike|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this one will play itself- k hearts coming down in 2 wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: run the spade Q for 12|pg||
nt|mamos: even with only 23 points 3NT wasn't a million miles away|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos: I confess to not having worked it all out but it appears natural to win @d in dummy and play Club|pg||
nt|mamos: a pretty quick one off I'd suggest|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth Connolly will be happy in a minute|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idblu: I would think 4@S the %age bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed, are they playing 5 majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and even the Q @S is not co-operating|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idblu: everyone here would|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: i agree - 3h on second round then smack them if they try 3 spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: E/W should certainly be competing as far as the 3-level|pg||
nt|mamos: all these four players are expeienced Junior Camrose players|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lestergold: theoretically 2s and 2 dims could be lost but only if declarer is put to an early guess in dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: it isnt now!|pg||
nt|jcmax: well on this auction I guess leading a @S from the West hand is possible....:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: I forgot the Muiderberg might prevent a strong NT opening :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: those of us whove played a bit more befopre might hold out breaths and put the 4h card on the table with the south hand|pg||

nt|mamos: EW will feel their caution was rewarded|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c on a finess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2nd seat 3H not recommended by old men|pg||
nt|mamos: exciting ........|pg||
nt|cindy: hafta get some xanax after that|pg||
nt|mamos: ok we move on|pg||
nt|mamos: more fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fits !!|pg||
nt|idblu: 50% vs doubleton K missing 7 = ???|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do we open as West?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: very hard but I think E has to play a heart|pg||
nt|idblu: this event is a great learning experience for these kids...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice hand for South|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 4@S EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: speak for yourself Victor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for your palinsyndrome?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|idblu: Michaels?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|odysseus69: spades and minor- popular treatment |pg||
nt|mamos: wow 3@h there is brave|pg||
nt|oliverc: That should raise some interest from East :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H overcall for very very very young|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fear :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is probably thinking about his methods here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: south hand very suitable for attempted suicide-|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|eggy: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: hi eggy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would expect more for a 3@H overcall. What about you, guys?|pg||
nt|eggy: I seemed to have arrived at a "sprightly" overcall|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is penalty so choice is double -only 300- 3NT or 4S- |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would never consider 3H even when I was young|pg||
nt|mamos: East West bid  quite soundly so East will expect a fair hand opposite I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- 500 for 3Hx - the preferred option|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: If West is showing a probable 5-5 with a Minor, East must surely be interested in a|pg||
nt|oliverc: Minor suit slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4@c is forcing, so thatÂ´s my bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that score card doesnt look too healthy for NI|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: slam needs too much|pg||
nt|mamos: even my generous spirit can resist suggesting that declarer's line was poor there -- no clear plan |pg||
nt|april7: oh yes ace of @C and ace of @S,sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S would like to bid but has no good bid|pg||
nt|mamos: INT |pg||
nt|idblu: may get overboard once N opens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but somehow on vugraph it's nice to have very boring hands|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes Tony, it had to be a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so you dont make a fool of yourself|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H EW?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: whenever the English were getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the Question|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Both West s passed|pg||
nt|idblu: easier to show later|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may go slaming now|pg||
nt|mamos: Dan Mac doubled in the same seat in Or|pg||
nt|chick: E's opening is pretty marginal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: think my chimp has some left over|pg||
nt|mamos: bby WESt|pg||
nt|idblu: won't have that problem now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North wont be finished|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no need when pard overcalls in spades|pg||
nt|idblu: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor will e/w be finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a theory that you should bid 1NT on the East hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6c or dim looks lioke a good save|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer did not have enough entries to finesse @s and @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 17 they did open the chunky 17 in 1N and are playing it there in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: will make 2 and lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think we've seen this 2@H bid before today 3 card Spade support or perhaps some other types|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah is that what it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: 1066 and all that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely you jusy have to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep perhaps 6 clubs x|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H might not persuade partner top move|pg||
nt|mamos: to move|pg||
nt|eggy: has another chance though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to get to 4 hearts though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so is double|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: sensible stuff|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is ok--maybe pd won't bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh I dont like double|pg||
nt|lestergold: west aint standing it|pg||
nt|idblu: W can't sit|pg||
nt|idblu: N can pass this|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: Hastings Pudding|pg||
nt|april7: thats straight forward bidding|pg||
nt|bobh1: if (s)he does, maybe it'll be okay|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats it Cliff (last hand)|pg||
nt|eggy: We that should get some sort of response I think|pg||
nt|mamos: hmmm   |pg||
pc|dA|nt|idblu: he did :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he did thats sheer inxperience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to overrule partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky this isnt a make really|pg||
nt|mamos: surely will bid now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a cheap save|pg||
nt|idblu: nice support N bought :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: NS are female Kerri North Ruth South|pg||
nt|mamos: gosh wrong again|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Goodness me - I would bid like this without @CA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: can the defence prevail?  |pg||
nt|mamos: fast forward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some may wonder why N didn't bid 2C. but if NS style is regularly to make less-than-fully-prepared TO doubles, N cannot count on a fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure why east was so keen to defend either|pg||
nt|idblu: nice stop|pg||
nt|chick: W's spade bid gives the @SQ full value, plus diamond fit and A in the last suit|pg||
nt|chick: E was far too timid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well a good spot for the boys|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: @cJ from W had been bingo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer 3@H there, 4@H sounds like a splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|idblu: thats what N thought|pg||
nt|mdgraham: west will be miffed to see @S10xxx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pretty well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 4th best would probably have worked :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Routinely, you play low from dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mamos: yes but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 ducks in @c a @h shift is needed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but not enough as declarer can duck twice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Will Ruth signal her A@D ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idblu: can make 6 with the @D hook\|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And there is a large bonus for bidding and making vulnerable games|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: yes - but if you lead 4th declarer has A10 doubleton|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: good save though|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: i think it is asking too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for a club lead on this auction holding such poor spades and a club sequence. but either could be the winner. |pg||
nt|mamos: good effort...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|idblu: but thats double dummy|pg||
nt|chick: looks to me like NS have only a partial in spades, so down 2 or 3 is a poor result for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: on the 6@C hand NS are in 3N in Open|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idblu: better take the @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant see 6....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: sure he could have got an extra 200 a level higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: how doeshe know whether to play heart or spade now?|pg||
nt|idblu: u get 3 @H pitches|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: timing must be just right for that I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 110 or 140|pg||
nt|chick: vs a likely 300 now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|mamos: now is the crucial..|pg||
nt|idblu: he doesn't|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lost a trickl|pg||
nt|lestergold: expensive |pg||
nt|idblu: E fault for not cashing|pg||
nt|capercliff: always a @h and a @s to lose no?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so|pg||
nt|eggy: now should switch to hearts I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N also does not compute so -200 might score|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: more bloodletting since 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: moment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well nearly there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could W not switch to hearts? he can count a set if E has D king|pg||
nt|mamos: lots and lots off|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|idblu: i thot E had 3 @S's my error|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6 would be much closer if S did indeed have a splinter:)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: 5 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: actually 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||
nt|mamos: Kelsey wrote about 40 good books ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and several great ones|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy for south|pg||
nt|mdgraham: discard diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but not easy for east because east doesnt know of double fit and doesnt know that 2 hearts arent cashing if played thru|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose East doesnt take West for tricks, with his preemptive 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our first match after the lunch break will be Northern Ireland vs England (Junior Camrose)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: signalling test - remember East opened 1@C|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but could see the @H going away|pg||
nt|lestergold: jump fits word work well on these hands|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close match now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: but England will get an imp (assuming East plays a club)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: it is, but it's not easy to say which of North and South should have bid more|pg||
nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and going wrong now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this|pg||
nt|mamos: this won't do :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: well   actually 8 more IMPs in the pocket for Ireland|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well defended NI|pg||

nt|capercliff: overcall from E hand?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: majors for sure|pg||
nt|mamos: and Ns minors of course|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1C promise clubs- do we know?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in majors against 5@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as used in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer unblocked|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|april7: and a free @S bid by S|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks easy enough here|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case surely a massive jumop inm hearts would show thenature of west'shand even withour specific jump fit agreement|pg||
nt|mamos: They hadnt but they weren't lead at Trick 1 and were on view in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they can get around that with @D though|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mamos: I don't know but I think it's likely|pg||
nt|daman: Wales just gained an impossible 13 IMPs to make the match closer|pg||
nt|mamos: ewww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how can it be "sound" when all pass. that is silence, not sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Marylin  Monroe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not from me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suit too bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on 19 E for Wales passed pout 1 spade for a swing|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: steady..|pg||

nt|mamos: can't call that timid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: 5@h is better than 5@s!|pg||
nt|mamos: South will surely do something but surprised N did not double|pg||
nt|capercliff: im a @s bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Yes Kelsey is one of my favourites. all his analyzes are perfect|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: ur too young to know it was a term for shapely hands uised in the fifties for some reason|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur too innocent to be told |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a club lead beats 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: North's pass should not be forcing at this vul and this type of auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about "more or less". i specifically agree with the "less" part. yes i would pass|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks a usual contract and 4th highest seems to beat it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eggy: and North presumably thinks so too, or he would have doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades -2 looks to give EW a chance here|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S too rich for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5 part scores in a row for EW - must be quite rare in a Junior event|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: less than automatic for me|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit odd, obviously not GF because they arent in game|pg||

mb|4N|nt|mamos: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick for tournament scores and format|pg||
nt|mamos: NS look like +500 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h shift will make -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 200|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h shift is also safe with @s K102.|pg||
nt|eggy: e|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right - as long as North still has lead|pg||
nt|eggy: But S may overtake and cash the diamond|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Right, but in my opinion N has to decide the defence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can tell N to shift to D with his signals but its only a recommendation|pg||
nt|mamos: undo Helen|pg||
nt|mamos: pass missed :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|chick: maybe, W has no defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I have also met him at the table. He was always correct|pg||
nt|cindy: im not liking that 2@s bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky contract for south|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cindy: looks like an overtrick here   next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the bad slit may be a problem here|pg||
nt|capercliff: well, its not GF apparently|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S looks normal|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@S passed out would be OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: another singleton Ace lead |pg||
mb|5S|nt|mamos: ugly indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: agree about 2S. this is a defensively oriented hand except for the sixth vclub, which has already been shown|pg||
nt|chick: its a good save, 5@H is makeable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values in the black suits, and partner may have nuisance values in trumps|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 1@d as S, not 1@s on that "poor" suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think West is lucky that 5@H is making|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another suit pref signal too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: noone lets you play at the 1 level these days Fred|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The English players are more experienced and it shows. For example, E-W in the open room are 13 and 16 years old respectively. Ralph Wiseman 12, Yonne (his sister) 16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ralph 13 that is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy: i agree with 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has to be bid but it isnt all chopped liver|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...for this looks to make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: probably you play these well, Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: no i dont|pg||
nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NI back in the lead after 5d -1 OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||
nt|cindy: its not N|pg||
nt|cindy: lol marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure if you bid 1@D you let West bid 1@h|pg||
nt|cindy: if S is interested in hearing from N again, he will balance|pg||
nt|idblu: I know that...I live in the 60"s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: It happened on 15|pg||
nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|eggy: and of course many of them (including these two) have played at U20 world level|pg||
nt|chick: with N's double, he may get the @Ds wrong|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the thing is, by bidding 4@D then 5@D, you have forced NS to guess at the 5-level - why assume that they have guessed correctly? |pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: pity there arent any systems posted.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: souths best shot i feel was a small dim and then a club retuern|pg||
nt|idblu: it would be nice to know what they are playing :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos: England are gaining on this board cos Fee Brown has made 1NT with the North cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idblu: OK now...ruffing @D hook|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|eggy: But we all have to start somewhere and this will be a great learning experience|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N made on some defensive errors and a big swing to Ireland|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idblu: oops|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: losing the maximum|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: well quickly on to our last board - thanks to Tony Wilkinson, Mike Graham, and Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yas and south is the younger brother of the Ellisons playing for Scotland in the Junior Camrose|pg||
nt|chick: I think he should have used his spade entry to finesse trumps, but probably would get it wrong anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: Thanks to Helen our vugraph op  - it's a difficult job especially when there are connection problems|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: north could have got a ruff at one stage but not easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: i would rather bid 2H on last if someone is forcing me to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not going to make|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|idblu: down again|pg||
pc|c3|nt|capercliff: not only have Phil and Fraz played together for a while, but they are good pals and both are in 2nd year at St Andrews uni|pg||
nt|yo_yo: couldnt the systems be posted on Ecats please organisers?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: chances, chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very awkward hand somewhat of a misfit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: In fact, I cannot win every contract, and playing 2@s on this board ....|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|idblu: it's tuff being a junior |pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jcmax: this is a VERY tough hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: no more than game available for E?W unfortunately|pg||
nt|jcmax: EW can make 6@H but not 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: we hope they dont get too high|pg||
mb|d!|an|spades|nt|jcmax: without a @C lead that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 6h is on amazing didnt spot that|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if they bid slam it will be  in spades|pg||
nt|jcmax: Or 6NT from the East side is also cold...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 6n by east too|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6c!|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam in 3 denominations i cant see being bid|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but i feasr it will be bid in the one that cant be made |pg||
nt|jcmax: once in a while it happens that your longest fit is not the one that produces the most tricks. |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: especially in the slam zone suit quality plays a very important role|pg||
nt|jcmax: and some experts focus very much on that when bidding strong hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: Do you think many pairs would bid this to one of the making slams Sabine?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: no, I would be surprised and congratulate anybody who managed that feat|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least they hve bid to a making game !|pg||

nt|odysseus69: do we know what happened|pg||
nt|oliverc: like an itch you can't scratch LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: we are having connection problems - hope it is solved|pg||
nt|april7: N shouldn't cover the J,  S might have singleton K|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by W?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s here|pg||
nt|idblu: ruff the @C draw 2 trumps and take ruffing @D hook|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think that was a tuff contract even for a wrinkly like kath to play|pg||
nt|mamos: once or twice today the declarer play has been poorer than I would have hoped - I know it's inexperience but also it's one area that practice and training can improve|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it was it was |pg||
nt|idblu: feeling very sorry for these kids |pg||
nt|lestergold: Mike u are master of understatement|pg||
nt|idblu: that would make them about 20 yrs old I would think...|pg||
nt|mamos: not a success for the Welsh |pg||
nt|capercliff: super-brains and super-guys if I may say so|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 19 and 20 years old|pg||
nt|mamos: nice guys certainly :)|pg||
nt|idblu: I didn't know an A from a K at that age :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are unbiased of course cliff:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|mamos: I begin to feel rather sorry for the players  - it's almost the end of a long weekend and truthfully these are the weaker teams in the competition  __ I think the strain is ...|pg||
nt|mamos: beginning to tell sadly|pg||
nt|mamos: The Irish team had a horrid time agianst Wales in the last match but seem toio have recovered their composure|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idblu: thx Helen..|pg||
nt|capercliff: I still dont Fred|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think West should have been defending 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@D was masterminding|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H a mini roman type call?|pg||
nt|mamos: whereas Kerri and Ruth have been on the back foot almost since the beginning|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: assuming 1n is strong I agree with the promotion|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont feel sorry for them they re enjoying themselves and sonmeone else is paying for them|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership the match manager and above all thanks to BBO for all this and finally thanks to you all for jooining us|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mamos: Hard luck Philip keep trying :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont want any to thinkI' getting at the players|pg||
nt|idblu: but the match couldn't be closer ...so their abilities are all equal|pg||
nt|idblu: that was my next line ...acording to my pards|pg||
nt|capercliff: absolutely Kath:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tough call for Ms Evans|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: i@H?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strong Nt is making a surge in England|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anybody for michaels on S hand?|pg||
nt|cindy: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|mamos: now take a deep breath ..... whatever 2@S means I wouldn't have bid it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, this set seems to be going very nicely from NS's point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sure Mike we have to encourage them- the game needs the young blood coming into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: transfer?|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is more like the Phil I know....|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: shh  F words ?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yo_yo: boys like to show off in front of girls, you guys know that|pg||
nt|idblu: I might defend 2@S on this vul|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this looks like ending in 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will she show her 5 card major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: v unenterprising by W|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 1NT was weak|pg||
nt|cindy: wow|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree, nice holiday for them, except it;s too near home|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told this is carrot.......... as in Bug's Bunny's "What's Up Doc"|pg||
mb|5H|nt|april7: 2NT for minors|pg||
nt|mamos: many pairs play that Michaels (my favourite convention :) ) is weak or strong not intermediate|pg||
nt|mamos: so for me no|pg||
nt|cindy: its a pretty strong weak if so|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably this is 5 card majors with a forcing NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if it was weak then i disagree with the failure to promote to strong :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it seems to me that everyone is falling over themselves to encourage young blood|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: Elmer Fudd's First Law of Opposition For every Duck Season there is an equal but|pg||
nt|mariner1: opposing Wabbit Season.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|idblu: my wife is from Belfast, so I have an affinity to these kids|pg||
nt|mamos: last board seems alittle unlikely that Scotland will gain more than 1 imp so a very successful match for England|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: amazing that East passed 2 @S|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT only ok if for minors and not to play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: if that outside junk were in my suits, YES|pg||
nt|bobh1: not if you don't mind missing games :)|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it is not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's wrong with the old blood!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie nicely here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this should make not equiring rosenberg /zia declafrer play skill|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@C stayman?|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps Scotland can get a consolation imp here? It would be worth a VP too|pg||
nt|eggy: It's possible, but hard on that lead I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: agree bob|pg||
nt|cindy: its beyond maximum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor West has nowhere to go for tricks here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then one might expect South to pass 2@H.|pg||
nt|mamos: I know slightly odd but a safe enough outcome|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose bidding again keeps EW out of spades, but they would probably have bid them by now if they were ver going to|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|dburn: in which case it was normal - no harm in being maximum once in a while|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even +2 possible it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: costly spot lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is tight|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt pretty probably encourage East to do it again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: up the anti,,, good defence required|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever it is it looks spectacularly unsound but fun to me :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idblu: wish trick|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|capercliff: always going off I suppose|pg||
nt|chick: yep, and everything is offside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjj: the average age (I would guess) is less than 20 - it is sad to see them denigrated by'world class' players|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @d now I predict|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idblu: 2345|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make 6 needs to finesse club and establish 4th club|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|idblu: another wasted spot card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: this can be tricky|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't agree with that - @H7, surely |pg||
nt|mamos: I want to bid at the Two Level with no long suit and 11 points ??  I don't think so|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: dont forget Mike, they are young and fearless |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: how many of you had a @s lead from S instead of @dK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: and looks like he can do taht|pg||
nt|idblu: down 1 probably best she can do|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: working play in trumps from Tom|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H going off in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead i suppose?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any lead could be right on this hand, even a trump! but i would lead diamond king|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that's why - South will assume that North had a singleton heart|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: on the replayed line spade Jack would have made|pg||
