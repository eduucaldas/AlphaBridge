pc|s7|pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Yes, and?|pg||
nt|mariner1: run some @S and watch is wise|pg||
nt|janm: And when he cashes the diamond AK, the Q will drop|pg||
nt|kareno: And east will be squeezed even if he started with more clubs.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|nt|janm: And he's going to play the diamond AK early, so he can keep his reputation as a fast player :)|pg||

nt|janm: now he'll play a diamond to hand and some more spades and the club finesse, except that when the @d Q drops he can claim instead|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: Karen he did, except one of them was a @D|pg||
nt|janm: I guess we don't want part-score deals if we want to keep the "no pushes" alive, but maybe they can find someplace else to play it|pg||
