nt|vugraphzkp: and we're off.|pg||

nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||

nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Hi all|pg||
nt|finch: x was 7+ balanced|pg||
nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
nt|eamongall: For EBU we have Martin Garvey and Jon Cooke a regular pairing playing on BBO most nights with various English juniors and ex-junios|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb: DOIGB|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: which stands for Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||
nt|eamongall: for Ireland we have Derek O Gorman ...who played in World Pairs Final back in 1990 as a 20 year old  but has been retired since about 1993 from serious bridge |pg||
nt|ppiglett: West missed the suit pref card of the 6D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wanted to set up his spades if pd had xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: and his partner Terry Walsh who is well known on the Dublin bridge scene..|pg||
nt|eamongall: both making their Camrose debut |pg||
nt|eamongall: I take a point from the gallery ...."Camrose is not serious bridge" ...  I think the players involved are taking it seriously |pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: Declarer will be uncomfortable in 2N but will eventually come up with 8 tricks!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jallerton: S was never going to find @cK lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lucky lead the favourable lie oft he sapdes looks like will see this soemwhat shaky 3n home|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: odd not to cash a top club before the third spade|pg||
nt|henryb: well on this hand N-S would make 3@c for 110, and 3@h will lose two diamonds and one of each for -50|pg||

nt|jcomyn: must be a test run|pg||
nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s or 4@s opener?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: two off would have been better with the club switch!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman from Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: hm, W has written down +100 ... Cooke has -50|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Peter :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but will stay till then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: convention cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|petepunt: afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
nt|eamongall: this appears to have 3 tricks to lose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A little unlucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: he has the none working @S finesse ..available |pg||
nt|eamongall: for a @H pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looking at @hJ|pg||
nt|henryb: really, the false preference! they must promise 5+ clubs for this auction|pg||
nt|chick: many people these days are playing that 1@S shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes rebids 1nt with bal 15-17 even with 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
pc|s7|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eamongall: split trump honors was required ...so unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb: but in that style South should respond 1@h, not 1@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s weak nt |pg||
pc|h2|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eamongall: and the 10 onside contributes our Sydney correspondant Thomas Hanlon|pg||
nt|eamongall: and as maker64 indicates the @D5 can gorw |pg||
nt|ciaran: Promoted a third trump there by overtaking the @D6 if that's how play went|pg||
nt|eamongall: gorw|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||
nt|eamongall: grow |pg||
nt|ppiglett: We've all been in worse - Tom?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed, but still, if North will rebid 1N with a balanced 15-17, you lose the value of opening 1@c with a strong NT when South does not respond 1@h and North will not rebid 1@h ...|pg||
nt|henryb: with 4|pg||

pc|s6|nt|james_h: Morning John|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||

pc|h3|nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||

pc|hK|nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
nt|henryb: Much more after partner bids 2@d? I think that W hand makes up in playing strength and controls what it lacks in high cards|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: together with a club and two spads unless the defence carve up|pg||
nt|jallerton: possible endplay vs N|pg||
nt|lestergold: three qs equally 6 questionable points not really enuf for game opposite a strong nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: small club from dummy, what can North do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to duck but may well not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite a few pairs play it as some major suit take-out|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate east seems to be a long time in the tank|pg||
nt|henryb: whatever it is with no aces East can only bid 5@h|pg||

nt|marlowepi: high offense-to-defense ratio. nothing matters on this deal, of course|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think you can afford jump raises when not vulnerable, but should avoid vul or min|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ppiglett: Defence missed their chance with five minor winners and a diamond thru to promote the J|pg||

nt|ciaran: Had chances then alright|pg||
nt|lestergold: well missed the detail|pg||

nt|jcomyn: morning Ciaran|pg||
nt|chick: there is a theory about when opponents make a slam try and stop in 5 ... cash your 2 aces because that's all your going to get :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: well, it was a play at the end, yes. but if E wins heart ace and leads a club at that point, declarer is down in cold contract|pg||
nt|mayors: Very thin 4@h NS|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 1@c lead directional and not expecting to bid again|pg||
nt|mowen: how strong?|pg||
nt|finch: yes, a 9-count opposite a strong NT is likely to bid it, however|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT is 14-16 in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|mayors: @s lead should beat it|pg||
nt|henryb: that assumes that 5@c was a slam try|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: if S had been 4531 on that hand, W would have had to return the heart queen after taking the D ace|pg||
nt|paulg: South was 4531|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent 3rd seat 1C bid by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes paul, sorry, i meant, without the Q of diamonds|pg||
nt|barbyh: north is surely shut out now|pg||
nt|paulg: tough for South to introduce hearts now|pg||

nt|jferg: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm wont do his confidence much good|pg||
nt|ciaran: 6D makes here on the lucky spade position |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 1@h or prefer 1NT?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: TONK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: said and done!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wow, the Tonk - "the ultimate opponent"? find that hard to believe at first glance|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't matter much what it meant, same defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy: not neg|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no marshall, still making 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: in fact with all th heart tricks, the spade position in unnecessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does S do now|pg||
nt|sharkirl: looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1NT for me - God deals you 17 to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: Can N-S sell to the doomed 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: that solves that good old Black|pg||
nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
nt|ciaran: I slightly pefer 1H since you can still get to NT whereas a heart fit might be lost|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 1D opening makes me feel a bit ill|pg||
nt|jallerton: A very good 17-count of course. |pg||

nt|viren169: via 5@S + 4@C + 1@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: line taken should be high @C, AK@S |pg||

nt|lestergold: a no prob 4s here|pg||
nt|henryb: Looks like Wales could win with a blitz and a big Scottish win|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy: if W had raised clubs, N could make resp dbl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-wind now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 5S re-bubbled|pg||
nt|james_h: odd double considering he is on lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance here|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek thinks oh No!|pg||
nt|eamongall: who would that be now ....Tonk Hamman ? |pg||
nt|eamongall: or Tonk Helness the ultimate opponent|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: that sounds better. Meanwhile, Cooke is wishing he hadn't reopened.|pg||

nt|henryb: Would need to win by about 70|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Easier to play in 3NT if you overcall 1NT though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
nt|henryb: and have Scotland win by about 50|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mayors: They have to lead spade to beat it, otherwise with @D guess makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: unlilely that partner has a diamond stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke checking signals now|pg||
nt|eamongall: Peter not everybody would remember Double Diamond ...it was a beer I think |pg||
pc|c2|nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||
nt|ciaran: selway now wishing he had doubled! will soon be glad he did not!|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - every option has flaws..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of bidding on that lot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed - three hearts a spade and a club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||
nt|jcomyn: question is would Carroll have x 1NT|pg||
nt|ciaran: I expect he would, but Garvey would pull to 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: brilliant|pg||
pc|cA|nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||

nt|ciaran: Well done.  Continuing the Q was his legitimate play, but the defense at least offered him a losing option by ducking the first @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ppiglett: I dont think he was flying to dummy to finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||

nt|james_h: If you open your windows in Dublin, you should hear Terry quite clearly|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as u say same 10 tricks with some fancy footwork in between|pg||
nt|finch: Jon is going to be very cross about this hand afterwards... even though he took a sensible line|pg||
nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looks a bit happier now|pg||
nt|eamongall: panic kind of set in and the defence remained with its best source of tricks in tact at the end |pg||

mb|p|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
mb|2D|an|?|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||

nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2@H should go two down|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S looks like 9 or 10 as card lie|pg||
mb|2S|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bridge correspondant of the Sunday Independant indicates Ireland can win the Senior Camrose this year |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trump lead would hold this to 6 or 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trump lead shouts out - heart shortage known in dummy and looking at heart length|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is Mr C offering odds?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ciaran: the clublead has given declarer a quick re-entry to hand for a second heart ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: absolutely|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
mc|10|nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||

nt|jcomyn: well a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|james_h: naturally :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another D game with thin values for 11|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agreed|pg||
nt|ianrei: hi all|pg||
nt|ciaran: Ireland gained 12 imps on the board where the defense can promote the trump J in both 2S and 3H |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Excellent H game E-W|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Welcome to Ian Reissmann,|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: could get overbord in 3nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: perhaps ur right - 1NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ian|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c game forcing I think|pg||
nt|mowen: 3nt by Garvey|pg||
nt|finch: NS have a 500 save against 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
nt|ciaran: There was a bigger score than 4H on offer there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke & O'Gorman checking the clock|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|jferg: although lavery show know after the rebid partner has 11 13|pg||
nt|jferg: too late now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||
nt|cindy: needed AKQJ of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: might get heart lead now i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: but shouldnt stop W from play @ss when he gets in|pg||
nt|jferg: still time for a spade switch from sime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonking wasn't that productive the last time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 80 min or so left|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
nt|petepunt: too many values in @D is appears|pg||
nt|henryb: only three top losers (well 4 because can't set up a @c) but I expect two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Townsend giving a lot of thought to his lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
nt|henryb: I tould lead a trump with those @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not obvious to double with no trump trick in either hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob same effect as e can;t continue @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
nt|ppiglett: And with 6 good spades and heart sup|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very well done|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: ten tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: whoops a googly in cricket terms|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: home free now|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've known worse "stoppers"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkirl: still under pressure|pg||
nt|jallerton: often most of the time on the other side of the screen is taken up with explanations!|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|henryb: one of the points of a trump lead is that it suggests control of dummy's second suit. |pg||
nt|henryb: So partner will be less tempted to duck the @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: very true,  he did give it a lot of thought too.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|sharkirl: needs @S finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: the other point is to cut down on ruffs!|pg||
nt|petepunt: also no @H overcall by S so likely only 4 yet he jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: wont hold aQ@S surely ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: well, it is easy enough to see that the club suit comes in when we see all the cards. if not i think there is a fair case for starting with a small one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||
nt|ciaran: Doesn' look to be any losing option, but he has a choice whether to pay for @H or @C to break|pg||
nt|ciaran: Can he combine chances?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|henryb: if he ruffs high, down he will go|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good competitive hand|pg||
mb|1C|an|?|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
nt|ciaran: 5H for E/W and looks like 4S will go one down|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gooke/Garvey's system is here: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|?|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2 down with perfect def - diamond ruffs and underleading H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
nt|henryb: not me. I pass a 15-17 1NT with East|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting|pg||
nt|ciaran: all systems are available here:|pg||
nt|ciaran: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes indeed Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5@Hs has taken a turn for the better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
nt|petepunt: neither can sing :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
nt|ciaran: East displays the magic dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Goo d new for dec at trick one|pg||
nt|chick: as do I ... balanced 8 usually isn't enough|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
nt|henryb: and a balanced 8 opposite 15 often goes down in 2N|pg||
nt|chick: he does have a play for this, endplaying N|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree with pass,  especially as opps may come back in vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: ponder..ponder|pg||
nt|petepunt: small @D |pg||
nt|petepunt: what else can he play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
nt|petepunt: the end play looms now|pg||
nt|henryb: Ace and a @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: but may simply play S for q@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: gr8 hand |pg||
nt|henryb: he has 2@d, 3@c and 2@s|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
nt|eamongall: or was it always making |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||

mb|2H|nt|paulg: a fair slam slam here|pg||
nt|james_h: I'll leave that slam to Jacko the Irish team captain|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid|pg||
nt|finch: but the system file has very little about competitive auctions after the opposing side has opened, so I'm not so sure of their methods|pg||
nt|eamongall: i have never double O'G since 1992, he always has an extra ace up his sleeve ..says Thomas Hanlon |pg||

nt|henryb: declarer"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2NT is 11/12 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that will make on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg: 4@s will be keycard, and 5@d shows 2 of the 5 aces without the @hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: why do those passes keep getting alerted ?  :)   cause S really wants to bid ?|pg||
nt|paulg: Liz, our operator, is trying to alert the previous call|pg||
nt|paulg: but the bbo software is not quite as intuitive as you'd like (as an operator)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4-2-2?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with S's pass over 1@h?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy: see i thought it was super intuitive, knowing S really wanted to bid|pg||
nt|paulg: (that is, if you are using the keyboard rather than mouse to enter bids, alerts, etc)|pg||

nt|jallerton: There is a school of thought that 4th hand should overcall 1NT a lot more freely these days|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ianrei: and the Hs are likely to be losers|pg||
nt|finch: the lead wasn't systemic|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know whether South actually huddled before playing from 10x of @h, If he did, he should not have.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the basis that people open and resond very light|pg||

nt|jcomyn: H 4-1 and both finesses wrong in minors - you might feel hard done by|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cant bid what you havent got because you hopethe oppos havent got what theyc say they have !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not generally winning bridge in my experience|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|finch: With the @D10 short, this will make 9 tricks fairly easily|pg||

nt|mowen: so the 2@C opener turns up|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C 8-13 with both majors|pg||

nt|viren169: some form of ghestem|pg||

nt|finch: 3@H shows 5=4=3=1 max|pg||

nt|petepunt: b;wood in what suit|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@h 3-suiter with short diamonds, 11-15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: pass terry|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very tough to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit passive by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: garvey deciding whether to show the void or not (and if so, how to)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|finch: West will do well to find the ace of diamonds lead, but we don't know yet who will be declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg: well done for keeping up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, wrong sided contract|pg||
nt|jferg: the contract might not have been as attractive if east did not have the dia q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but would E bid 4H with:   Jxxxx  x   Qxx  KQxx ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ianrei: even with 30 points the 4-4 fit is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 4NT two key cards without the queen of spades|pg||
nt|finch: pass = I do have clubs stopped quite well|pg||
nt|finch: good effort to stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mowen: super sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: they need quick def tricks so a@D poss|pg||
nt|jallerton: Interesting trump lead from Qxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Even with the club wrong, N/S have 5C, 2S and 2H|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4333 8 count opposite strong NT ....hardly bids game |pg||

mb|d|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||

nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||

nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||

mb|p|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||

mb|5H|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||

nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||

pc|hA|nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||

nt|eamongall: Wales by 20 against North|pg||

nt|paulg: N/S play 2NT as 20-22 ... that is a large range so no reason to upgrade poor 19 counts|pg||
nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||
nt|jferg: yes when 1nt was x and coffey bid 2c he was showing clubs and dias, if sime paases he shows willingness to x a bid showa weakness|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|cindy: thats pretty good marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: put that on yer cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 21-9 to holders at the moment|pg||
nt|ciaran: should be some imps for e/w there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: don't think walshe would have looked for @D ruff with singleton trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: this looks good for EBU at +35 IMP. What does that convert to, commentators?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
mb|4C|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|eamongall: about 21-9 but I will check|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 35-40 is 21-9|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: slam try 3n|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|chick: serious 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes think thats the name :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|viren169: I could be a Euro up or down depeneding on next trick!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkp: grr, verrrry wobbly connection here, sorry again all|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|james_h: terry must unblock|pg||
nt|jallerton: catching up, not playing a speedball!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg: the upside for declarer is that he knows that this will be the same everywhere|pg||
nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||
nt|finch: if the acution starts 1NT (weak) double and NS find their heart fit, you can see that might happen|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: noooooooo|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and no side winners to discard heart losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry MUST have unblocked otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: comfort break|pg||
nt|eamongall: that 13 imps translates to 3 VP in this case ...18-12 now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: if it stays that way then England take a 6VP lead into final match|pg||
nt|eamongall: England remain 90 imps ahead of scotland |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: all back and play resuming|pg||
mb|1C|an|?|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
nt|eamongall: he is not going to get any help in clubs so 3@Ss it is|pg||
nt|eamongall: and will be one off in about 17 seconds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, commentator's curse|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
nt|petepunt: may struggle to 6@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
nt|chick: excellent contract if they find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
nt|eamongall: if they get the bidding finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I think O'Gorman expected 3+ clubs opposite|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D will save a few imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
nt|chick: scary though, will all those losers staring at you|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d lead is a good start for the defence.  What's the best line?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not my fault those guys did not agree their defence to Unusual NT overcalls|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it's not your fault Cooke & Garvey couldn't bid 6@h earlier!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg: true|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway 5 tricks off this so dow ntwo|pg||
nt|eamongall: two|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and cooke could have bid 6@Hs ..they just never started|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: West was playing a 14-16 point 1NT at the other table, so East made a game try, his partner not accepting.|pg||
nt|jallerton: A great result for Wales in other room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ciaran: Another big board - 7@H is a good contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: doube fit territory always measn both sides can make lots of tricks|pg||

nt|ciaran: Hard to bid in most natural systems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaastrous|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: A trump lead solved the problem in that suit and declarer soon had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If 2@s shows specifically the red suits, that makes it easier to bid on as East|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: i have to bid something with N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the sponsors, commentators and spectators who laughed at our jokes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this double is presumably conventional|pg||
nt|jferg: no pen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H followed by 4D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Board was flat in 7@H in the Wales - Scotland match I believe|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach a thin 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: another fairly gentle game here, should be a flat board|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cindy: why would W pass then ?|pg||
nt|jferg: and lavery will xx to show a five card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator says double is penalty|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think E should get this right anyway|pg||
nt|eamongall: hmmm silence is golden ...I have mopped the floor ..rescued the boiling over ham and made a cup of tea since my last comment |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a bid that would not occur to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double should show a minor or 4M, 5m hand|pg||
nt|jferg: prefers poker|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C now|pg||
nt|james_h: and they are on the road|pg||
nt|lestergold: now eastmust kbnow that his hand is not suitable for defending|pg||
nt|finch: this will turn into a very close match|pg||
nt|eamongall: its probably because we have loads of Irish commentators driven to silence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, you didn't miss much!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or russian roulette with FIVE chambers loaded|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N shows good raise to 3@h :(|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ciaran: In other matches, England were 46-0 up against Scotland last time I checked|pg||

nt|jallerton: another 16 boards in each of these matches this afternoon|pg||
nt|ciaran: Anyone know how Wales - NI is going?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Garvey doesn't look confident of making this|pg||
nt|brolucius: It could hardly be natural, facing a one-level overcall and on a passed hand. You would need around 13 points at least for such a bid. More, probably.|pg||

nt|jferg: do you have a rescue agreed when x|pg||
nt|finch: Finally thanks to BBO and a special thank you to Roland Wald for all his hard work. We return to the Camrose at 10 am GMT tomorrow morning.|pg||
nt|finch: The Welsh got off to a good lead of a diamond from the North hand at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: a chance for Wales here as 41H looks makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 4 min now on the clock|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||
nt|eamongall: a string of small gains for EBU split by a couple of large gains for Ireland|pg||
nt|eamongall: tonk retonk |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: tonktonk|pg||
nt|eamongall: its really snowing in Waterford |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor fr  N/S looks makeable|pg||
nt|finch: looks very hard to beat when played by the long hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Tim, our wonderful vu-graph operator in Oxford. Great concentration!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
nt|ianrei: tough decision for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my excellent co-commentators, Ciaran and Ian|pg||
nt|ciaran: EBU have a good position here - 2H looks good for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: you're welcome - hope to have better conn this afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Cooke and Garvey muddling the auction on not many values|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@H looks like a good raise to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: west hand improved now|pg||
nt|mowen: but what to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this should be 1 off for a few IMPs to Ireland|pg||
nt|james_h: you get the feeling that NS have their tails up going for all the part scores with gusto|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
nt|jallerton: Next session starts at 12.25GMT, 18 minutes from now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
pc|h7|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
nt|finch: decalrer must feel in a lot of trouble, but he can't really go off with South having everything|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: byeee|pg||
nt|finch: oops.... all Cooke has to do is win and play another club|pg||
nt|finch: looks like West didn't count his tricks properly, he's trying to get out for one off|pg||
nt|petepunt: blocking @H complicated things|pg||
nt|mowen: key moment|pg||
nt|mowen: it could be right to win and play K@D|pg||
nt|jallerton: they really are catching up now|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: trump back would have sunk the ship|pg||
nt|cindy: thx all|pg||
pg||
