nt|brolucius: A fine auction to the grand slam by Israel.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's been a while since I saw a better hand than West's|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: W only needed to know about the Q@c on E, and after he confirms it - he just bid the grand slam|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, only 1@S.  A "normal" weak 2 in @S at this vul might make it even tougher for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How did he confirm it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@H would not be best now. West has time to look around.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy to find that crucial club support by west|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@d - one honor out of AKQ|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 4@S best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so far it's the same|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@H solo?  On your worst days, you could be down in 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction idntical so far|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brolucius: It seems that if clubs are 4-1, you would have to drop the @DQ doubleton even if you guessed correctly which defender held @CJ-x-x-x.|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a diversion|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like 4NT, two places to play, usually both minors|pg||
nt|othered1: But it will be h ard to find the @CQ now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now W has a problem of how to set-up @c's as trump|pg||
nt|yuval10: and ask for the Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think they did so well in the other room to find 7c|pg||
nt|othered1: That's one reason why it's hard to find the Q :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer points out that a spade lead will force you to ruff and restrict the possibilities of picking up a 4-1 trump break.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 5@C was a lucky response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could well be that 4NT would work better. I think it's superior|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, a spade ruff, six hearts, four clubs and the @DA-K would make it 13.|pg||
nt|othered1: Somehow it feels earned to me, when partner asks youi to bid and you get your best suit directly into the auction.|pg||
nt|davidb: very optimistic bid by W in the  closed . needs good breaks  |pg||
nt|othered1: Is is possible that east could be 4=3=3=3 on this auction?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well David, basically it only needs clubs 3-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4NT may look good, but it has made life very difficult for West. Perhaps, after all, it was better to bid 5@C (which would allow partner to take control if clubs was one of his ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: suits). 4NT is more like the sort of action you could take after a couple of doubles by partner rather than 4@S. |pg||
mb|6C|nt|othered1: And how would you bid with no suit of your own?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A deserved swing to Israel. |pg||
nt|meikever: For info, results and pictures: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thinkt the Poles were a little unlucky here. I still think 4NT is best|pg||
nt|othered1: Unless  they have a specific agreement that 4N shows minors only, how can west be sure he's not playing a 4-3 instead of a 6-3?|pg||
nt|davidb: J H is also an important card|pg||
nt|yuval10: i support Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont think they can be criticised for playing in 6C- many experts think that a 3/2 break isnt good enuf odds for a grand to be justified|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: if @c's and @d's very opposite in W....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and half of the 4-1's Mike|pg||
nt|othered1: I fyou're going to  play in 6 isn't 6@H better?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's better than a 3-2 break, as we discussed. With a spade ruff in the bag, you can pick up 4-1 clubs on one side.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but anyway, this is going to be +13 for Israel|pg||
