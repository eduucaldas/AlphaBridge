pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|finch: Knowing that the defence wil always duck the first round of spades, he's actually on a guess at the next trick|pg||
nt|finch: as he just needs two spade tricks, but they cannot be slow ones|pg||
nt|finch: that makes the low club lead better than a non-club lead, as on a red suit he needs the spades to come in|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mayors: NS getting a bit high on this misfit|pg||
nt|finch: At the other table EW play a strong club, and the 1@D opening from East helped NS keep the auction low|pg||
nt|finch: East has a horrible lead problem|pg||
pc|c7|nt|finch: What would you lead on that auction?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mayors: A @s is not unreasonable. North sounds very short and south probably has only 5|pg||
nt|finch: EW can take the first 6 tricks, but the diamond position is not how West will expect it|pg||
nt|finch: In fact, I expect West is most likely to duck here, just to try and hurt their communications, but it's more likely to hurt the EW ones|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|finch: East led a club against 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|mayors: Now low @c?|pg||
nt|finch: I guess so.  Remember that East's 1@C opening could just as well be on a 3=4=4=2 distribution|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|finch: If declarer could read the opening lead as shortage, he knows East has all the remaining high cards|pg||
nt|finch: the problem is that doesn't help him much|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|finch: They'll probably be quite some Robsonian thought here.|pg||
nt|finch: In particular, is it right to cash the other top spade at this point?|pg||
nt|finch: He knows that his partner is going to be endplayed, and otherwise they may never make it|pg||
nt|finch: ...but against that it sets up dummy's suit|pg||
nt|mayors: I think he may well switch to @hs|pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can see that one card through is enough with Qx in dummy|pg||
nt|mayors: Qx is in declarer|pg||
nt|finch: good point|pg||
nt|mayors: The fact that declarer hasn't played on @h may well suggest partner has strength and length there|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|finch: yes, he bid diamonds and played on clubs, and fairly obviously had singleton @SQ|pg||

nt|olson: clubs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pdjourdain: Heres the grand slam. Murdoch left the spade guess to last and knew the shape|pg||
nt|olson: 12/14  nt  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: pass or xfer to @Ss?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sommer: 2N is 10+ with 4c @H|pg||
nt|granguru: some played only 6@cs here...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In vulnerable and with a so bad hand! Pass is the only bid for me.|pg||
nt|viren169: and now? Pass or dble?|pg||
nt|olson: not sure why S  wants to bid  on that hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: so this is a critical hand for the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S should be a @C transfer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In modern bidding there is no penalty doubles...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sommer: ..called Truscot|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3C shows fit, 3S nat|pg||
nt|granguru: S didnt super-accept|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed Patrick. Murdoch discovered that spades were 4-2 and played, with the odds, the hand with 4 for the queen|pg||
nt|granguru: so he did accept|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|viren169: this will be no walk in the park...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Now 4H cue|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|viren169: we have specs split over pass and xfer (assuming South had passed)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: setting suit with 4C allows Keycard|pg||
nt|granguru: there is also (not here) a chance for a @S-@D squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 could have been laydown. Give South @SQ instead of @HQ. Not so easy to find out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so both aces AND club queen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary knows it is at worst on the spade guess|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: should try for 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: correct, and it may be better than that. 7 is a fair shot|pg||

nt|Walddk6: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 2 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|mayors: Very akward on @s lead, in fact not sure he can handle it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mayors: but the lead directing pass and 3 honours weren't enough to tempt him|pg||
nt|finch: I'm fairly cofident you can make double dummy on a spade lead, but it may involve playing West for his precise hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|finch: The diamond lead doesn't immediately cost a trick, but it does tell declarer the diamond position which may help|pg||
nt|mayors: I don't think you can make it on a spade lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mayors: Played it well so far.  Knows a @d ruff wont hurt|pg||
nt|finch: yes, he needs either to make something of the hearts or take a few spade ruffs to come to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: He can be certain the lead is a singleton after Allfrey suggested a @s lead|pg||
nt|finch: ...and the other thing the lead did was tell him that West may have some heart length|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|finch: Allfrey can see no future in the red suits, it must be either a spade or a trump|pg||
nt|finch: a spade looks better as declarer is going to be short of entries to hand|pg||
nt|finch: ...but there is something to be said for a low spade, possibly|pg||
nt|mayors: Now he has to draw one round of trump and play on @ds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sK|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|finch: this is a trick short now, with spades cashing|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mayors: Tough hand but I think he probably should have got that right from the position he got to.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|10|pg||
qx|c16|st||md|2ST87HT32D853CAQ87,SKQJ6532HQ85D2C93,SHAJ97DAKJT4CKT62,SA94HK64DQ976CJ54|sv|e|nt|viren169: ???|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With @s N must play @c in a rising sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: I think the operator is playing tricks with us!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: and now a signal for @d, if there is any defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Sco gained 11 on B22 but Wales gained 13 on B23|pg||
nt|granguru: Polish @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Can N/S find game in 5@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wilkinsona: lucky 12 here perhaps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: It appears Cliff Gillis can make 4 Hearts here|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: Last chance for N to come in...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: game is no longer on the cards now!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona: yes, good welsh defence on 22|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: 5@c is not an easy contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: NS trying out methods over 1 N|pg||
nt|viren169: A of @S may defeat 5@C (thks to the specs)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: but decide against|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S now seem an overkill!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Jeff Olson from USA|pg||
nt|olson: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi Jeff... what do you make of this auction?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: At least one trick away in @d and @h and that thump should behave|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a kind lead|pg||
nt|olson: good spot  |pg||
nt|olson: it would be tougher on a spade lead|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sommer: 6@D is makeable, but not easy to find|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think it´s impossible with a @s lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru: This one should be a tied hand..|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: can he guard for hearts 4-1? crossing on third trump allows d finesse|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Throwing losing club on second spade only gains when south has two spades|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: now win and 2 rounds of trumps and play heart up |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: well its just the diamond hook|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: Now he can clean trumps and play @d. but still problems|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: I am sure the Welsh aution was looking at it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: ..6NT makes too of course - and is a bit better than 6@D even, with no possible @Sruff|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was a kind @hQ!!!|pg||
nt|viren169: now it is there... |pg||
nt|viren169: West was hoping to find T of hearts in pd's hand...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and so what!|pg||
nt|viren169: still a rather strange contribution... |pg||
nt|viren169: yes you are right... |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and play @d|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|olson: 2 more trumps then concede diamond  |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|sommer: claim coming|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: ..but finds the 3-2 break|pg||
nt|granguru: and that's it...|pg||
nt|granguru: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|olson: ruff spade and lose a h and make  5  for a good  result|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now he isone trumph behind|pg||
mc|11|nt|olson: he can  pitch 2s  and ruff the last one |pg||
nt|viren169: N/S did well to get to game after a pass of 2@D|pg||
nt|olson: sorry :(|pg||
