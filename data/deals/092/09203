mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: hehe -- meaning more fun away from the bridge table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N obviously takeout for minors -- would your partnership know that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think very interesting to differentiate between 2N and DBL [responsive] in this sequence|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some might say DBL = 3/4@S  others more defense than 2N, etc   key is to agree with partner|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: not sure why Ino asked, not sure why Hirata rejected  to me, 4@H now is mild slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@D just a cue bid instead of a game try?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: he hoped 3@s reply...|pg||

nt|athene: so a quiet 3@C for lots of imps|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the other room n rebid a quiet 2@c and ended in 3.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: will they fight on 5-level here?|pg||
nt|xenya: very likely|pg||
nt|viren169: tough 4@H for E/W to find|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 5@C for N-S if they do, possibly|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: 4@D as fit-showing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: once W bids @s E has a great hand, or so he thinks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: east can bid stayman and then 4@H over 2@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 2@d= good @H raise?|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... it will hard to decide whose hand it is... and may not be willing to sac|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: now a super-accept will get the job done|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: Szalay trying to slow down the bidding biut can't|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did you consider the reverse even borderline with that honor structure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it wasn't completely bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a great hand on pds 1@h opening|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I prefer 3@H here|pg||
nt|viren169: by West|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the club void facing no strength |pg||
nt|viren169: all too late she cried!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead was required to set this|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't bother with 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: silva is not happy with previous board|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make, i suppose, if declarer picked things right|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no wasted points in @c....|pg||
nt|athene: given time, declarer can set up the long spade for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but he won't get time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||
nt|pelu: will or can :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: when after A@H and @H ruff he starts xruffing and W shows out on @D the srop of K@C will be clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: drop even|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzkc: re|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|nt|athene: south won't imagine that declarer has only @CAxx|pg||
nt|santyclz: He would have 10 tricks, but ...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would be interesting - the trick is to draw trumps and keep control of clubs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|hJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i'm not sure if it would make in practice on a club lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|viren169: either reverse dummy by ruffing all 3 clubs or hooking the K@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: i am sure there are distributions when ino could have gone down (although i cant see them) to me that looks like an IMP thrown away on the last board|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm with you Michael|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Versace going quietly?|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: holding 4 trump -- Versace stays out of trouble -- remember Lauria made DELAYED takeout double|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as some point out -- the question is whether or not Versace should bid 2@D over RDBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this looks like 5 badly needed IMPs for ohno|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: i think that shows clear preference that he doesn't really have|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yes he is quite content to play in partner|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: partner's 5 card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: partner isnt always 4441|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||
nt|athene: east might lead the @DA though if north doesn't show the suit|pg||
nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cicus: well, Winkler's plan of slowing it down hasn't quite come off|pg||
nt|viren169: and I can feel Lencastre smiling!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: and ducks, giving declarer the @SQ for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: hoping for miracle @HK coming down, then there's no need for the guess|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely preserved entry by declarer|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|vugrapha1: its an interesting point someone made to me the other day|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sometimes everyone wants to have their little say in the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: so by staying low you can let them have their say and sometimes stop lower|pg||

nt|athene: north might double 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: it may have taken a bit longer in the play without the 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's the least unappealing option :)|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: better to pass...|pg||
nt|athene: we saw he doubled 2@H on the 6430 earlier|pg||
nt|athene: after 1nt pass 2@D pass 2@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: east can't really have slam interest can he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: how did they get to 2@S in CR? -- oh N just bid it|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes 5+|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, identical auctions|pg||
nt|othered1: Another routine 3N|pg||
nt|athene: but i certainly don't mind 3@H anyway|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzkc: yes it seems so...|pg||
nt|athene: this lead gives declarer time to play on clubs, but it doesn't really help him|pg||
nt|viren169: North has bid 3@D over the multi in the open room|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D opener by Lauria would be 18-20 bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but 5422 probably not best fit for the convention|pg||
mb|3C|an|18+ Natural|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: +520 -- that's never one you like to bring back to teammates|pg||
nt|henryb: a good 6N: either a diamond break or some luck in clubs or something. 6@d might be a little better|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 dias great here|pg||
nt|henryb: I love it when the opponents had the first five tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: people who say 7@D -- have to stop looking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 7N looking at all 52 isnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: versace likes his minor holdings -- but unsure about major kings|pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb: 7@d is not all that bad. you need to be able to ruff the third club and then squeeze somebody if the @cQ has not come down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no stopping them now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb: I would guess it is about 55%|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: i would think that shows 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine 3@D not forcing|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|henryb: On the lie of the cards you have a double squeeze, but it might well be a simple if the distribution were a little different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suggestion that 4@D is Turbo - but i don't know that convtion :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hate to be in grand needing 32 trump AND squeeze|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: in terms of the match 6@d = 9 IMPs 6NT = 11 IMPs (assuming he makes 13 which i think versace would) 7any = 14 IMPs|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: and most embarassing -- going down 1 when opp in game|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: which sort shows the sillyness of bidding 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|vugrapha1: you might pick up a good swing for playing in 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: best contract|pg||
nt|henryb: But you should not bid a grand when the opponents stop in game. You gain 9 imps from bidding the small, 14 for the grand.|pg||

nt|ady: 4 spades a good save if vulnerability reversed|pg||
nt|viren169: may escape for 1-off|pg||

nt|fabsayc: +200 i repeat|pg||
nt|athene: well cashing the @HA finds the second spade loser :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: then why -2 in CR?|pg||

nt|cicus: in CR it went down 2, probably a diamond was ruffed|pg||

nt|hedyg: a good chance that N has doubleton @S|pg||
nt|xenya: can't N have Axxxx in @Hs and Kx in @S?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sometimes the bridge gods favor the odds against contract -- raskly devils ... um gods|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: hirata could have held him to 8 tricks by leading Ace another @c|pg||

nt|viren169: I think E/S will take the push to the 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south will definitely sac now|pg||
nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ady: will it go higher than the 5 level?|pg||
nt|athene: E-W aren't playing a strong club are they?|pg||
nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence to hold up the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: then you have to commit yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east's 1@C is a bit strange|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@D with that shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 2@H in 1. round - in moders bridge u need to take space from opp|pg||
nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i see it is usual to open 1@d with 4-4 minors in Hungary|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||

nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||
nt|viren169: this could be a telephone number!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: as you see here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: now someone might have @DA8 left with clubs 3-3 all along|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|nt|cicus: there might be declinations, but the rule is 1@D for 44|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|hedyg: i think Italy as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: i am told Brazil too|pg||

nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N doubled in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they stopped in 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||

nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever south does, west will probably just bid the same 3nt he was going to anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||
nt|athene: so both pairs playing Capp|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c was minimum|pg||

pc|h2|nt|othered1: I must leave for a bit.  Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Thanks, bye|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|xenya: well it makes now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||
nt|athene: assuming declarer plays three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: now @HQ is sure to score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm how do you beat it now?|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane would have beaten it easily|pg||

nt|hedyg: what happened?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzkc: probably Pinto should have bid it...|pg||
nt|ady: I think east might have competed with 3@H    |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|viren169: I think declarer played South for singleton honor or 2-2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: it just means south can't play spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but there are plenty of other things for the defence to play|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: now|pg||
nt|athene: right :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|viren169: noone has any spades to play!|pg||
nt|athene: south discards the @SJ as a safety play against accidentally pulling the wrong card later in the hand and giving declarer entry to dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass of 2@d was the winner.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: 2@C was puppet stayman, so 2@D didn't deny a 4-card major, so east had to press on|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: 4@H in other room so looks like flat|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D some flavour of Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: showing a decent 4(+) card spade raise|pg||

nt|viren169: poor lead when holding most of the outstanding values!|pg||
nt|viren169: need to attack here...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @DK might make things a bit harder for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so this is a Morten's Fork coup|pg||

nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead trump.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: No problem|pg||
nt|athene: well played Von hafe|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: You win the second club, cash 1 high heart and play 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pg||
