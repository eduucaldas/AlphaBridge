nt|ralfwil: bad defence! W has shown up with 8P|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South told North that.. |pg||
nt|werge: A very good 6 @c here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all. Let's hope we will see an interesting match. With these two teams being in it I have no doubt about it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all and welcome the the White House |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: here we go|pg||
nt|chick: Great :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone, welcome back to the White House Juniors :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice hand in north |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it will do until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|raidouille: Chaugny - Puillet are playing a natural system|pg||
nt|voldenuit: NS doesn't use to play together let's see if they use 2@d multi or 2@d game forcing |pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|raidouille: 2@d GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: this time a bad partial contract in @H for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Here South needs a @D-ruff in dummy to make 4 @S - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need help here,  these are 4 players I do not know |pg||
nt|raidouille: French style :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: goulash hand |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5@c or even 6@c|pg||
nt|april7: they play precision?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2NT is 7+ without ace |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all. let's hope we will have a nice match.|pg||
nt|ady: no names of players|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: yes they do|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S may land too high here.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad idea - South must be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes but it would be in a regular hand |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: a rather good 4 @S here |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|werge: But on a @D-lead, you go down, Best play must be taking the Ace, then @C Ace - and 3 riounds of @H...?!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yesterday you told about a very conventional system. I think this pair is NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes it is|pg||
nt|werge: - but not this time...|pg||
nt|werge: North mus be declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one can only conclude from the French methods--2D is a GF while 2C is not quite GF--that the French bridge players get about twice as many rock-crusher hands as the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|werge: -did I say that?|pg||
nt|werge: For me, 3 NT is a normal bid with the East-hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N not interest in slam since knows missing 2 aces but|pg||
nt|cindy: so does S think N has a balanced hand ?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 4NT with north hand which for me wld be to play |pg||
nt|raidouille: agree with you aymeric|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would classically show pretty much what North has got, so South can go to the three level with a nine-card fit |pg||
nt|baldfriede: But pulled in the reins just in time.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North has no real reason to go on, so they have judges well|pg||
nt|werge: But best lead is 7 ot 8! of @D|pg||
nt|werge: or 8|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt is forcing now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: so in this "natural system", on strong hands nobody starts bidding naturally until the 4-level ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek came close this year in the dutch "meesterklasse", loosing in the semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and he won the meesterklasse pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is impressive for U25 |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: South must shift to @H, when he gets the @C Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff a @D in his hand you mean|pg||
nt|tomi2: west has really 7 spades? thought this is a junior tournament :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that our best spot?|pg||
nt|raidouille: wow|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claire has passed she isn't sure if 4@d is trans |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i'm guessing as 2@H would be a neg 2N shows a @H positive|pg||
nt|cindy: no but it makes|pg||
nt|voldenuit: but fortunately @h are 2/2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: just need to untangle it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: which makes me wonder why norht didnt support earlier|pg||
nt|raidouille: 2NT is positive without aces and balanced|pg||
nt|cindy: 4D must have been a transfer   why would N pass 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: system notes won't become a best-seller on the basis of this auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|werge: Now he is home, clubs are behaving well|pg||
nt|chick: dangerous play by W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or @DJ!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am sure operator will give them as soon as he has a moment.|pg||
nt|voldenuit: on a @s lead it's down |pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: i dare to predict they will reach 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And I dare to predict, that West might lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a contract you wouldn't expect in a junior tournament|pg||
nt|ady: finesses laying well   clubs 3-3  so defenders cannot take more than 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but timing is important here.|pg||
nt|gips: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: P;ushy, but making 3N to start out.  Actually figures to make 4 if west takes the @S finesse|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|april7: but could go down on @H swich after @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on now - is, that they are telling E/W what they have...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know what they told..  cant read what North wrote down..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: 8 tricks, I regret|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: If South bids a so-called Viod-wood, West might find the lead!|pg||
nt|werge: Void-wood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think North is relaying|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but a friendly one-level contract is fair for warm-up in this event|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: these hands are one of the problems with strong nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|werge: I would discard the @S 9 here|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|werge: Best card from South next seems to e te @H 7|pg||
nt|werge: be the|pg||
nt|april7: each @H is ok|pg||
nt|werge: With transfers yes - but the transfer occured too late...|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find q of @S doesnt he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can cross the hand out now |pg||
nt|werge: No he can cross-ruff, when he discards a @C from the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again on perhaps being forced to play the @S right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are perhaps slightly fortunate that any heart ruff comes with the ace of trumps |pg||
nt|baldfriede: One can hardly blame East for leading @s though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are cracking me up Marshall.....|pg||
nt|voldenuit: she has to play @h now |pg||
nt|sybarra: best the Q?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aymeric's "nom de clavier" is the title of a fine novella by Antoine de St. Exupery|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gips: it looks like the light opening bid of aldo paparo let a very good score, even if a little bit lucky, for italians|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: 2 means can stand return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best percentage play is one of two finesses but with 2-1 in @c he can have a discard so there is a choise with a @d lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: Yes, agreed.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7 rounds of bidding and only 5@c!|pg||
nt|voldenuit: :) well done claire :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: No - for sure a normal lead|pg||
nt|ady: can actually end play North for 12 tricks  unles he discard AKQ diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahalim: right, maybe they're not fully awake yet :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: not now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: we have 6 rounds with 10 boards each today. we play a compleate round robin with 24 teams that is 23 rounds in the next 4 days|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: plenty of tricks now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why didn't N unblock the heart?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that made it easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's a nice surprise for North|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to hear this post mortem?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|voldenuit: @s ruff @d and a discard @h |pg||
nt|raidouille: @s ruff and @h discard on @d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: They should have taken 5 runds - and bid 7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@C showed 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@H was rkc, and then it ended|pg||
nt|xenya: well this doesn't look too convincing to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: west thought long and hard about his bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: first 4 play semifinals and finals friday. so its a long trip|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: I don't agree, E has no entries ... if spades do set up, he won't get to cash them|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: other room reopened with 1@S and they overbid to game|pg||
nt|chick: he should try to hit his partner's suit|pg||
mc|12|nt|meikever: Results & info at http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: slight problem, declarer didnt cash a 4th @D and played a heart that got ruffed|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may need to take a deep breath after that one (both teams)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh pooh|pg||

nt|werge: This is a VERY good 7 @S|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S or 6@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe an imp  |pg||
nt|werge: So - 7 @D|pg||
nt|ady: could only make 11 on the end play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now that thje result is in and NS is plus, it is a much more useful result than if they had bid a boring 6C or 6C, as those would have been cold. now they can get "carryover" from ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the fact that EW will be gnashing their teetch about the big swing they let get away|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The slow @D 7 is Wests own fault - he ca take 2 minutes before taking the @C Ace!|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a push,  never need to apologize for that |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C= great hand or weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, East got a trump trick now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: when he played @D8|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Slam time.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: A grand even.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East doesn't appear to have many entries here either - and, looking at it, neither does West|pg||
nt|chick: I would have tried a heart lead on the last hand|pg||
nt|werge: I knew it would happen - now they will hardly find 7|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: sometimes a natural system is easier....|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like to play weak jumps even in 4th seat, so 2@S would have been my call but if you play standard methods 2@S is stronger. with reopening you sometimes make opps bid a game that ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: they would not find else, so I have sympathy for his pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what I bid with S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C might be wiser |pg||
nt|chick: doesn't work any better :)|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be the fashion to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Missing a chance here, unless South decides to chime in.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|othered1: west  has a flat hand with NT count, but unless 1@C isn't natural, why distort the hand when a siimple 1@S rebid is available?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think e/w got the big swing per operator|pg||
nt|raidouille: no drury ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|werge: Godd bidding, both tables play the jump for pre-emptive|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for it Raymondt!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say "vince")|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SjoerT Brink always calls him Vinnie|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  but I am not so familiar with him to do that |pg||
nt|sybarra: is N thinking of bidding?  I doubt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: He is|pg||
nt|werge: Another to the toilet? We fall asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North is thinking..|pg||
nt|werge: Thinking of whom?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: of 6@S?|pg||
nt|ahalim: The @S Jxx makes this a good 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this round all nations, who send 2 or more teams to this event play against each other, like this match, to avoid this pairings in the later rounds of the round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: must admit that 2@C would not be my rebid with souths hand. 3334 and some kind of semi stop in spades, thats a normal 1NT bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes then N has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|tomi2: north might now misjudge his hand and go for some club contract expecting partner to be more unballanced and have no help in spades|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello Cornelia.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Good|pg||
nt|chick: Are we having fun yet? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: good point Hans,  what was her name again?|pg||
nt|werge: He better only think of 5 @s|pg||
nt|werge: So they might bid a bad 7 @h now - and make it|pg||
nt|meikever: results from round 5: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: strong club fo;;owed by a few natural bids would have worked out fine there i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like the 3 nt call, and now to beat this |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking back at the hand, i find it odd that E led a club from three small instead of the Q of spades--the latter seems automatic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: will anyone of you try 3@h on E?|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests 2@S bid took one cuebid away for north so he has to decide the final contract now, he will be surprised but not unhappy with this dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 2NT re-opening is enterprising|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt E/W will make here, since @s favourably and @c too and @h split 4-4.|pg||
nt|ady: t his will come home |pg||
nt|gips: i am quite agree on the 1nt opening, with Qx and Kx it looks like the best part|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a "non cue" |pg||
nt|sybarra: or help request?|pg||
nt|chick: it's not a good grand ... requires 3-3 hearts or the J to fall singleton|pg||
nt|raidouille: Indeed, a spec told me that 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@s = or +1 |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|werge: 500 in your hand(s)|pg||
nt|xenya: not me Ralph|pg||
nt|werge: Sporty guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: or often called "last train"  (unusual at the 5 level) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think he wanted 6@S but was not sure..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North, ok back to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be "happy" to be in only 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra: is "back to 4 @S"  called a reverse??  (LOL)|pg||
nt|werge: reserve|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what if South gets an entry to dummy, he might take the @D hook?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am a bit surprised by 2@h. Certainly West's hand is worth more than that.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I just know that if I did it, the opponents would wake up, bid 4@H, and score 620|pg||
nt|chick: It was alerted, perhaps shows more than minimum|pg||
nt|werge: Jack to fall is no good = one down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or a good 7@d. Since all bids are alerted - who knows what they mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H, yes. But 7@D is excellent |pg||
nt|chick: yes, even that ... 3-3 hearts is necessary|pg||
nt|voldenuit: east has to overtake the queen of @c the 2nd trick |pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzjy: hmm not after this lead ;)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Felix Zimmermann from Germany|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: W will be happy to make 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Felix,  welcome |pg||
nt|400 volt: HI all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ill try and find out|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am being told it shows 8-11 with e-card support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Note that North has seen his partners' re-openings before |pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3-card support*|pg||
nt|chick: yes, a kib also tells me 8-11|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: oh well...see what happens when you lead pards suit?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@D is best I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure 3@H is right on that. Possibly transfer to hearts and then bid diamonds|pg||
nt|werge: You might fall even in 6 @H having a lay-down 7 @d|pg||
nt|chick: if you were in 7@H, how would you play the heart suit?|pg||
nt|gips: better to protect the sorter top honours|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: incorrectly|pg||
nt|werge: No J x x by East or J x x x by West - what´s best?|pg||
nt|gips: shorter|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Not my kind of opening, to be honest. I am a bit old fashioned about 1nt openings.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|werge: But all you need in 7 is trumps 3-2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|april7: only 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: Where are the loosers, when you ruff two @H´s in the East hand?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|april7: 13 |pg||
nt|sybarra: now needs the @D cash and the ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: or club, @D, @D,  and sp |pg||
nt|gips: second reason, a bit more difficult for opps to bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: low club from North would be a tester|pg||
nt|chick: they should make this, so S's gamble didn't accomplish much|pg||
nt|meikever: results round 2 can be found on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has to switch to @d now.|pg||
nt|chick: nice looking playing site :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will be worried about a 5-1 diamond split |pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|werge: Luckily enough it´s difficult to bid 7 - West could have the "other" red king|pg||
nt|ahalim: what will W discard on the @C's ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: but down now on a club switch|pg||
nt|chick: S can see the diamond suit on the dummy, so he must attack clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But what other options did declarer have? He can't get rid of the @s losers and the @c loser anyway. I think trying the @d was his only chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to see how a club switch can cost here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, South does not know about K@H.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But if a @c lead is bad, is then the @d lead any better?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baldfriede: This is not as easy as it looks at all. If @h are 5-1...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Indeed.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjy: hi everyone|pg||

nt|werge: What a lucky 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough match,  only 1 imp the air so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you know any of the players Felix?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: all players in discussion, wish roland were here, I don't understand anything |pg||
nt|raidouille: 4@s in EW|pg||
nt|voldenuit: boring board |pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: No, sorry :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may just up and bid it |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a difficult lead, With a black lead 3@d is -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very,  qj of @H falling |pg||
nt|sybarra: its imp pairs,  sorry |pg||
nt|baldfriede: 11-13 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: maybe by seeing, but not more :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|werge: Good board here for those who smoke|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it imps agst. the field? |pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: Hi Shirl|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: 6@S unfortuntely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they should avoid 3N, but that won't be to hard..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Arifin:)  |pg||
nt|gips: for the same reason, my opening bid here was 1@S :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: 140 is the limit|pg||
nt|cindy: what do they respond 1N with ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Thomas|pg||
nt|ady: a mis fit      4@S a possibility    but poor game|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding west's hand in length-order.  Some very respected players would open 1@S without second thought, especially with the suit qualilty disparities|pg||
nt|othered1: But that rebid would not occur to me.|pg||
nt|gips: 5 clubs one down only with trump lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Especially with two aces outside|pg||
nt|ady: even without a trump lead   still down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|werge: Often defenders take the @D Ace, three @s-tricks - and finish with the 13th @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Here trick 11 comes from the weakest suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 8 tables..|pg||
nt|werge: I think they plays 12-14 - but counting the intermediates...|pg||
nt|ady: trumps not strong enough if a spade is ruffed|pg||
nt|gips: but not 4 spade..... because defense has no suits |pg||
nt|ady: this does have some chance    club lead can go down immediately|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: must play for spades 3-3    then set about clubs|pg||
nt|gips: the only chance|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I prefer 1NT than 2@d |pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4 @S was not the contract I expected :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: and ofcourse also 6 @H and 6  NT|pg||
nt|april7: doubleton K of @D|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 6 NT on at @c-lead - South is squeezed I´m sure, when West takes the 6th @H!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: scores at:  http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: My lead is @c10 from that suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: e/w will have to open the @D suit in time, @ST is dropping... ok not anymore|pg||
nt|chick: You can find all the information about the tournament on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - with pictures of the vugraph tables!|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it systemic?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: what would bid after 1nt with East hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they play strng+5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 1 nt also but I play 2/1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: It seems to be the plys called - I just take my tricks|pg||
nt|werge: play called|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead will also help|pg||
nt|ady: club lead from K(6 most unlikely|pg||
nt|cindy: 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: as opposed to british acol, fmous for light 2/1's|pg||
nt|cindy: W is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1 nt even in 2/1 is semi forcing I suppose |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: should be in tempo duck |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get the @C suit goin I think |pg||
nt|tomi2: he could overtake the @H, esp. after @H9 was played by west|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is a passed hand and has a very nice doubleton in opener's suit ans some controls and a decent (thought short) D suit. I like 2D|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont think most play it forcing at all by a passed hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|werge: But South will lead the @H 10!|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room did bid 4@H on 5 -- bound to bring them lots of points |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: This is a imp pairs (butler) So the score on the left is not important|pg||
nt|400 volt: I think I would have stayed in 1 NT with me :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be very trick to make if he can |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good poker hand - four nines|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has an entry!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: it costs only 3 imps|pg||
nt|april7: so whats the loss?|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that was better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: and then play spade towards dummy, then he can make 3 spade tricks |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|400 volt: @D q was misclick?|pg||
nt|ady: K96|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: this may be a swing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: could be a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the @h was a misclick :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: :-)|pg||
nt|400 volt: Does someone know if there's a official site for this event? |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes one sec |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|nt|tomi2: now they cut off his communication to the spades, he cant use them anymore because he lost the tempo in trick 1|pg||
nt|gips: not finished yet|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: Still may have to guess @H|pg||
nt|gips: e must guess the heart|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 2@d the @s aren't enough beautiful to bid 3@s and a little too beautiful for 2@s |pg||

nt|sybarra: close eyes and hope for sp splite|pg||
nt|sybarra: *split|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience, half-measure compromises like 2D create more problems than they solve. in general, i think it is better to bid 2S and hope you get another chance. after all, pd ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did make a 2/1 and so he is very likely to bid again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my last comment i was referring to  a 2D rebid by opener|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: @C4 was now a lavinthal discard showing values in @D|pg||

nt|tomi2: fisher takes a lot of time, he does not want to make a mistake. but he must be carefull, in my experience most TD's give time penalties for slowplay in the first round(s) and later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: not, to show all players that they care for the time|pg||
nt|tomi2: thx Meike|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: washout only 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: so 6 @H should have been made in other room|pg||
nt|werge: Should we say it this way: It seems, that 6 @H might have won in the other room...|pg||
nt|april7: if you pull trump and play on @S you must play Ace of @D and @D and you make it|pg||

nt|werge: @Slam"...|pg||
nt|400 volt: expensive one|pg||
nt|werge: When N overcalls 1 NT it will be expensive...|pg||
nt|othered1: That's quite a nice result for EW|pg||
nt|gips: no, 2 @H, 3@D, 1C and 4@S|pg||
nt|gips: 10 tricks even ducking the club|pg||
nt|ady: had to try the low heart to test west|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Slam???|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to get there |pg||
nt|sybarra: @C or nt?|pg||
nt|werge: - and guess the trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok no X|pg||
nt|400 volt: if the other table stays in 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 NT seems to be 3 down og a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: on a |pg||
nt|april7: another 6@S and 7 without a @H lead|pg||
nt|april7: sorry only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% slam, 12 tricks with @sK on side|pg||
nt|werge: A slam here - and E/W will have a giant-score|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess the clubs in either game |pg||
nt|ady: yes one K@H was played|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@c semi forcing 2@d 2Nt |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: errr either slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: are we linked to other room? |pg||
nt|400 volt: something like  10 imps :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is their 2 nt opening? |pg||
nt|raidouille: 20-21|pg||
nt|raidouille: so here it is 22-23|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|400 volt: but we'll only see the scores at the end of the session|pg||
nt|400 volt: they startet with the second last and last board of this table|pg||
nt|othered1: west bids his suits in natural order here, too.|pg||
nt|gips: another board where is better to push.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @C slamish |pg||
nt|tomi2: OR already finished 2 more boards|pg||
nt|gips: 10 of clubs and ten of spade makes the slam reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on invite les spectateurs francophones dans cette salle de nous adresser leurs questions ou commentaires en francais s'ils preferent|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@d is relay any |pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: NS play precision but South didnt want to relay I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are gadgets, not sure I can explain accurately |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C, minor suit ask,  and 3 @H=4+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: exactly 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: otherwise 3@D, i have a 5(6) card minor|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 3@S was alerted as "to play" and not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: barrage like |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: other room has started with boards 19/20|pg||
nt|400 volt: we may see what the other room played in the first board here|pg||
nt|werge: Strange bidding by West - system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do I feel about a 3 count?|pg||
nt|raidouille: 3@c stayman|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: may be - opening 1@D looks more normal in a natural system  |pg||
nt|othered1: Slam is possible here, too, but HCP shortage will keep them out|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: North´s jump must be due to the fact, that they play strong @C-system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: For standings:http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even a try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, it prevents south from showing his @D support. you can make 4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just checking. Did 6@D go down on 21? If so how when no spade lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|vugraphzjy: http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|sybarra: E more interested now. setting the trump suit for cues  |pg||
nt|baldfriede: East will not be really satisfied with his ! stoppers.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: and now bid some "i feel like we should do something" double and south does not know what to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely will not put his hand on a @H lead |pg||
nt|400 volt: This splinter bid of north, showing a single/void in @C, didn't encourage south very much :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 2@s showing every 12/14 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@c splinter bid|pg||
nt|werge: @H-lead will be good for the defence|pg||
nt|werge: This looks like 2 or 3 down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: There are some communication problems for declarer here.|pg||
nt|chick: yes, and the @H situation will be clear immediately too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as in, he hasn't got any|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S looks normal from east|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: here its -1, even -2 if they would manage a club ruff, but often enough seen such auctions ending in just made|pg||
nt|gips: 3@H half stop|pg||
nt|ady: slam is very dicy   with 3 kings missing and 2 5-2 fits|pg||
nt|ady: it can make as the cards lay|pg||
nt|othered1: Is east sure that he wants to keep seeking out NT?  West could have a very pointed hand so far and east does have a couple of good cards for that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: went down, no spade lead,  just careless at end|pg||
nt|raidouille: big swing for Ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i thought S might have got excited after 3@S, even though 1@S was limited |pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wanted to put it mildly. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: does E blast it out? |pg||
nt|chick: he will need to use the @SQ to get to the bd|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt is down I think |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently not Puppet|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes trump miscounting or anything else|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it went down, declarer had a boss heart in hand and the same number of trumps as her opponent\|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a @D lead does that help?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: 3@S on east would have focused on @H as well and might have offered a superior contract.|pg||
nt|ady: tht they would settle for 3NT     slam needs some luck|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead helps, i predict a make. duck and duck again|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@d 1@s 2@c 1@h |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raidouille: yes but maybe she has discarded her heart on @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: this gives a problem     needs k@D  for a definate entry for the clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|400 volt: ruffing a @C now, @H to A, @S 10 and @S 5?|pg||
nt|400 volt: best chance for 11 tricks I think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: its not a good slam anyway|pg||
nt|othered1: saving the entry to @C|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|werge: No - but it´s easy to play...|pg||
nt|sybarra: there quicly will be no trumps in opps hands |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: *quickly |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is defending well|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tomi2: south has a difficult decision in the end, since partner can have "only" 4 dias in their methods he can not bid them, his hearts are too weak for bidding them one more time, so he ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: goes for pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: now if he raises with the king.......|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer to open 1@C - so I am not forced to bid 2@S next time|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: there is not blame here,  how to you evaluate,  kxx, opposite qxx |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we continue directly, this was the slowest table|pg||
nt|sybarra: what can pard have?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should have ducked the club|pg||
nt|cindy: yes andhope for no spade shift|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why discourage opps from establishing your long suit? they are there to help you, so let them|pg||
nt|cindy: but E might be too smart for that with the 3D bid|pg||
nt|voldenuit: but east won't have play a @c he knows he has 4@c |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|ady: J@H  will come back if he established clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is that you have nothing to lose by ducking the club. for all declarer knows, WEST might have the club 2, in which case E won't be able to tell how many clubs W has|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|gips: safety play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjy: end of round 9, we will resume in 5 min|pg||
nt|xenya: however S needed to find a few specific cards with N for the slam to be good, so his signoff looks quite reasonable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this round will make some change in the standing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think a lot of people missed the 6@C, only saw 1 pair so far|pg||
nt|xenya: which is somewhat surprising|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Indeed, but thats what happened|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh, in trouble I think |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: may settle for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|werge: Not too well - a @s and it was 2 down with closed eyes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjy: end of round 1, (rounds of 6 boards) we will resume soon|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: partner should have the ace for his double, you see he has no other ace and he was not forced to double or bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is a lot of discussion aobut this hand in the post mortem|pg||
pc|s3|nt|400 volt: ah ok, this is even better :) could ruff the 4th @H if he needs to|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|april7: helo everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|xenya: there we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Sorry we have the wrong set of boards moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Tom,  hence my question...what can pard have?|pg||
nt|tomi2: those scores are the ones you must avoid in team matches|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @S opener on that hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: but everyone has own opinion |pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this match at http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57 (at the bottom)|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice score :) |pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt made|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: NS play strong 1@C with canapé|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2@S next time?|pg||
nt|400 volt: the same here, but it's the same problem as the problem with the chicken and the egg :) who has been first?|pg||
nt|sybarra: after I open a sp,  not much choice I suppose |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek explaining 13th board: I didn't know what I bid, I didn't know how i played... didn't make sense at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, up to that point :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and this time, there won;t be any score correction due to a ruff :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: its not easy to reach 4 @S, but we will see|pg||
nt|tomi2: even if this goes -1, you gain only 3 imps but it will cost you a lot of energy to defend such contracts|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S thought declarer had Ax? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: declarer claimed for 7 tricksand the defenders accepted|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: you always know, that every mistakes costs millions|pg||
nt|raidouille: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s? |pg||
nt|april7: neg. or penalty?|pg||
nt|werge: A rather lucky 4 @H for a beginning|pg||
nt|ady: south a bit stuck   may double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Morning Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Hans, Vladimir, Ralf and Gerbrand|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@s in EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: neg. :)|pg||
nt|april7: thats what I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Neg - at that´s why you should PASS with that hand!|pg||
nt|werge: Mojn|pg||
nt|xenya: a very lucky 4@H for NS here, but i don't think they'll get that high|pg||
nt|baldfriede: it looks as if operator is catching up with events.|pg||
nt|chick: I think the operator is getting up caught up on the boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok give him a cup of coffee|pg||
nt|gips: absolutly disagree on west pass|pg||
nt|ady: a situation not to re-open   3 cards to an honor inovercall|pg||
nt|raidouille: hum ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: hello Roland, Hans and Ralph|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Tim,  we even appreciatie that |pg||
nt|othered1: north, east and south bid normally here|pg||
nt|cindy: what is that pass ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk1: ranking at : http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/USS_2_Page1.do?event=goToPage14&rndid=52208&verid=3&catid=|pg||
nt|sybarra: more likely (imo) that pard has Ax |pg||
nt|sybarra: is it too early for a beer? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: The guy doesn't drink coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe that explains|pg||
nt|werge: Another luck for N/S - that West is declarer|pg||
nt|ady: pass from south reasonable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|werge: I open every 5-5 in black with 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I would show @S+@C if possible in 1st bid...|pg||
nt|werge: - but this was not opening, I see...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I want to show my twosuiter as fast as possible and not in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|werge: 800 - and now you must fight hard to get 420|pg||
nt|april7: and wait for the <|pg||
nt|sybarra: how we doing now?  Rehi |pg||
nt|pelu: ok - them whisky :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|400 volt: at least he saw he didn't play v well, so he maybe doesn't need coffee :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would pass |pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: and wait for the X by E and pas!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think we're good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East doubled,not west|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bold double by West, but it looks as though it will pay off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, East doubled.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|werge: May be they play 2 @S as showing NO stopper in the suit|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a misunderstanding concerning 3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: We are up and live now..|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hoi Gerband|pg||
nt|werge: But 9 tricks without any problem|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, partner must have that ace, but still I think north should not double this holding no trump trick and only one ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: Peter,  a it early for the hard stuff dont you think?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should make, though|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: no worries, Wessel, we appreciate you taking the trouble to enter these|pg||
nt|voldenuit: hard bid for East 4@d for majors or 2@d and then 2@s hard choice :) |pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: hi Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe forced to play the hts correctly here |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably take a chance of transferring to something |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3nt? Partner bid 3@d over 2@s!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: the ranking is after 8 rounds of 6 boards, 7 rounds of 6 boards today.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|werge: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: only @C back defeat 2@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: (or ducking @D Ace)|pg||
nt|400 volt: because you have no quick entry to the @D for discarding @S Q|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree also Tom |pg||
nt|mdgraham: always nice to have the ace of trumps when you have made your "book" against a doubled contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: its not a hard fight|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|april7: @D now and discard @S on hight @D later|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|othered1: east can pitch @S if they play @H and north ruffs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzjy: South asked if North would be 4@H after invite.. but eh said no|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: But North shoul have taken the Jack of @D - to play @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushy X  |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done East - if West revokes now, he's in trouble |pg||
nt|chick: E could see he was at risk of being endplayed, so he cashed the @CA and exited safely|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer can play up Q@h now to hold it to -1.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tomi2: he could find a bid on 2@S showing his minor holding, like 2NT would be in my methods (6 cards in opened suit, 4 in other minor)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: this is probably not the "match killer" hand|pg||
nt|pelu: u are richt Felix|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|werge: But with East as declarer, it´s easier|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: problem fpr west   if he bids  partner might bid 3 clubs   which he does not really want to hear|pg||
pc|c4|nt|400 volt: but now he defeated himself?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the 3NT hand, EW had five chances to put a spade on the table. better communication or more careful analysis is advised|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|pelu: but still big problems in @C - sh have played @C after @D|pg||

nt|werge: Few loosers N/S - but not so many tricks either|pg||
nt|werge: But might give N/S 1 point|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  and of course 1 imp can be "killer"|pg||
nt|werge: Here it´s not about 1 point|pg||
nt|400 volt: but lost the plot later|pg||
nt|400 volt: 12 IMPs for the netherlands|pg||
nt|chick: a nice 3N here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one part of the problem was that when E returned clubs he led the deuce on the second round of the suit, which presumably suggested to W that clubs were 4441 around the table, so ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not cash them?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning from Sweden|pg||
nt|werge: Morning "hinsidan"|pg||
nt|april7: if N doesn't bid after 1NT then W plays 1NT, but N could bid DONT and play perhaps 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a partscore in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S on?|pg||
nt|werge: It´s impossible to get less than 12 tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is fabulous venue btw |pg||
nt|sybarra: White House, in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|ahalim: ok they're still young and hopefully learn from their mistakes|pg||
nt|gips: but the chance not to find fit in partner's hand are reduced for the high number of diamond opening bid cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have some tired puppies here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes, they are the unter 20 team, so they have 5 years or more as juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: U20's need to get back in the game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wessel, you need to shut dowm and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|raidouille: they have played all day long|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: or some other convention after NT|pg||
nt|xenya: questionable whether they will find the fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: will start next week |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @D from North, pls|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gerbrand, playing there now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they are playing at white house now|pg||
nt|400 volt: (4 @S X -4, as we might have expected)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @D might get E/W overboard|pg||
nt|meikever: next match on vugraph in 45 min is: Belgium - Netherlands Red U25 .. see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for the full playing schedule, articles and pictures|pg||
nt|ady: again a low part score      2 clubs n/s   not much else|pg||
nt|raidouille: from 12 to now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ready to party now|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: That West-hand is too strong to be a 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but difficult to find|pg||
nt|werge: So - 1430, next board|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is refurbished tennis facility (12+ courts) and a fabulous building, patio etc. ) perfect for the bridge tourney |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ok|pg||
nt|raidouille: beer time |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: will need Gerbrand to remind me of names,  but 2 gentlemen purchased the facility and tuned it into fine place it is (of course they are bridge players:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does W bid?  5 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East left to toilet..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be sick,  he has the good hand LOL|pg||
nt|gips: too high now|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Okay...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Ralf and Hans|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like 120|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy:  Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford,|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Gerbrand,  I just could not remember the names |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North telling SW, that East left|pg||
nt|werge: West can see his own @H-holding - so he knows, that Easts 4 @D is a big hand with self-made @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and does 5 @S say W has control of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tricky stuff |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think many of us "plain vanilla" types would bid 5 @H |pg||
nt|werge: When I was a junior, I opened the West-hand with 1 NT - suppose they play 15-17 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hey i thought WE were the ones who were susceptible to fatigue ! these are youth !!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the venue is conducive to that with little bar at one end of main room |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: and Gerbrand, our operator|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT is a winner - as both minors behave extremely well|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know what system north-south plays?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: you are very aggressive Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does 5 !N ask for club control?|pg||
nt|werge: For Aces - 4 NT was not available|pg||
nt|sybarra: an told:   5@S good hand with spades, 5NT ace asking|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C sh be a 5-6 card suit - why not 3@C??|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: we can probably refill our coffee's on this hand |pg||
nt|400 volt: why 3 @C? because you found your fit - I don't know what 2 @C after X is in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: "do we play TIC"",Tim asks|pg||
nt|voldenuit: it shld be made |pg||
nt|sybarra: the White House is a fabulous venue, old tennis club with about 10+ courts still in operation and wonderful renovated club house|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: why was south bidding|pg||
nt|gips: it looks like a kind of precision|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: No - I just want to point out, that with so many intermediats + a good 5-card suit, you ar too strong|pg||
nt|werge: Service double - good for East to know...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  we have landed as they say |pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel U25 are title holders here and they are among the favorites in this event. Others will be Netherlands 1 (I think its red, so we will see them next match), France and Poland ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: imo|pg||
nt|400 volt: what is TIC?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: transfers in competition|pg||
nt|400 volt: ah :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Polish @C, I'm told by several specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if nonvul, or if W were not a 3rd seat opener, E might bid 1NT over the double, but under these actual conditions Pass is well-advised|pg||
pc|h3|nt|werge: Anyway - E/W landed fine|pg||
nt|april7: now NS missed 3@S|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see good handling of the @D-suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is where, if North held @DKJ10x, he should double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: as it is, of course, he doesn't|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D in third seat not unreasonable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|400 volt: obviously not :-)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Agreed.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to lead a heart, but nine tricks now |pg||
nt|werge: Is they continue @h´s - it will be good to unblock dummy´s King!|pg||
nt|ady: maybe north sometimes has a major with this opening    jsut the same south should not have bid|pg||
nt|gips: very hard now for west, he should play @H for 1 down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: well NS have 6 top tricks -- still a chance they will take them|pg||
nt|sybarra: take ace of @C,  and E claims,  (as long as no ruff)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: hey,  you are not that old Felix |pg||
nt|pelu: so they dont know the system??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: not a usual partnership no|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek plays with danny Moolenaar, Stuurman is with Frank Visser|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: You mean 4 @S|pg||
nt|april7: on @S lead only 3|pg||
nt|werge: If you do´nt start with 3 x "S, 10 yricks are easy|pg||
nt|werge: 2 x @D|pg||
nt|april7: but they are experts and lead 3x@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: but Frank had job conflicts and could not play this event |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes, his new job started at.... march 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: take it or leave it offer|pg||
nt|sybarra: good timing to get a job,  but bad time for bridge events |pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: 3 x @S|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: old tennis club? so we can expect doubles?|pg||
nt|meikever: pictures of this round are up: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Meike,  |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: Now East is short og ONE entry...|pg||
nt|werge: of ONE|pg||
nt|sybarra: and venue shown well here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: Declarer will probably take them from the top.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|voldenuit: carole is thinking if @d are 5/2 or 4/3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Women are from Venue?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gips: 2 of @D was suit preference, west did not follow his partner|pg||
nt|raidouille: and now ?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is quite a facility they are playing at  The White House in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - no point messing about|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|april7: but 3@D 1 down also ok|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a renovated tennis facility and absolutely beatiful! |pg||
nt|voldenuit: west in return to hand |pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: they won't|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||

nt|voldenuit: what wld you bid with north hand? after 1@h |pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: tricks....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: but south said, you get 2 more..|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  not sure why it is called White House, perhaps a dutch friend can tell me |pg||

nt|sybarra: that might be one reason |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and they probably where out of inspiration|pg||
nt|tomi2: this board reminds me of a discussion we had in our team in beijing, does a passed hand have a GF-Fit raise available?|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of @Hs with that fiendly layout|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S will land in 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is baseball expression)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's the opposite of my usual sort of advice|pg||
nt|raidouille: Open room : 3NT is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we could say "take them off"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT?|pg||
nt|raidouille: 2NT is 3 trumps invitationnal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|400 volt: yes, 5 @H possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: best contract is pass now|pg||
nt|april7: what about  N? W is not afraid at all|pg||
nt|othered1: Real trouble isgetting @C into the auction, very tough here|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to save now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But they will have problems making it.|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  a value raise in spades I assume|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S could be tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: This should be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West: When I played 4crd M openings pd always has more fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: will they bid 4?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2 off probably |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: 1N wasnt forcing but south bid 2@C anyway..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cue's start a force |pg||
nt|400 volt: in IMPs not impossible to bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or not after this multi opening.|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2 points are lost in @c |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: there are two schools of thought about defending Multis - one, as here, is to wait until opener has defined and then double for take-out |pg||
nt|chick: EW could get to a very makeable 4@H, too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i assumed that was the meaning but still i'd say "?"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: I suppose it´s early in Holland....|pg||
nt|april7: what? S doesn't X???|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt South paid his inscription!?!|pg||
nt|april7: no confidence in partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont you love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another is to double immediately with 13-16 or 20+ balancedish.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: I see what you mean but he showed @h so 2@h had been Jacobyr without a @h control|pg||
nt|sybarra: very friendly layout,  can they make 4?  with the @D's not behaving well?|pg||
nt|400 volt: very passive by south|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|april7: can't |pg||
nt|xenya: everything wrong for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East starts asking about the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: now "we" just have to make it |pg||
nt|tomi2: one teammate holding a very similar hand bid 2@S in this situation, that is normaly GF in their methods, intending to show a "verrry maximum hand" but to pass partners 3@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2NT would be invitational and require extras from partner for game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have pushed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT must be better if East can get West to play it - picture @H10 coming through Qxx |pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for @H10 lead?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahalim: and this is not so easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have no @S,  why not?|pg||
nt|pelu: he had placed a @H in the @D-suit :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|werge: Let´s be straight: When North doubles 4 @H, he can´t let the opponents play 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|april7: he new it before that EW will go to 4@S, and wanted S to double if possible|pg||
nt|werge: N/S can agree upon on single point: THEY BOTH HAD A CLEARCUT DOUBLE over 4 @S|pg||
nt|werge: But a bad game anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a very good bid  2@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: it certainly is an area that needs to be discussed |pg||
nt|tomi2: opener took this 2@S as realy gameforcing and bid 3@H with the intention to make a forcing bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: on this lead easier now|pg||
nt|sybarra: no has to play the @H right |pg||
nt|sybarra: (again)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well predicted, Mike.|pg||
nt|othered1: tricky mighyt be an understatement but north can get two @D leads from dummy and get lucky|pg||
nt|voldenuit: this hand is beautiful with A1098 and J108 |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I like 2 nt even if it is invitational |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the Losing Trick Count does not support an invitational call|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: The problem with passing initially on hands like the East one is that the bidding may be  uncomfortably high when it gets back to you|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|chick: only double dummy :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well, but the overcall makes it appear quirte clear how @h are distributed., so ducking one round should be fine.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|tomi2: i have sympathy for making the "GF-bid" "strongly invitational" in this sequence, but I think you must discuss this with your partner. but then again if you have not discussed you ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should avoid 3@H "i hope thats forcing" and simply bid game with passed partner|pg||
pc|h8|nt|400 volt: even with a @D more instead of a @H, 3 @D after 2 @S pass pass looks ok, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|werge: 2 @C is a text-book bid with this hand - we cannot play 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can "we" handle all of this given @H start?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may go wrong here|pg||
nt|tomi2: Fisher tries to falsecard here, dont know if this is a good one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: S cant be a junior|pg||
nt|400 volt: but a nice defense, probably for down 1|pg||
nt|pelu: candidate for the Senior-team?|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to your comment,  thinking about whether I would introduce jxxx at the 3 level,   still thinking...|pg||
nt|othered1: now down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: well if clubs run, there is some chance -- and it's a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|werge: OK|pg||
nt|gips: down in 4, not in 3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: as a general principle, though, would you lead from the spade sequence or partner's bid suit?  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: really making declarer work for this one and perhaps-1 now |pg||
nt|tomi2: imo @HJ increases the chances of a singleton king, because K5 and KJ are both same likely and you would always play the low one, but with J5 and in similar situatuions players tend ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to falsecard too often|pg||
nt|chick: I find its pretty rare for the multi opener to bid higher than 2N ... it's more of a problem in the 4th seat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: half the point crammed into a doubleton, and the good trumps might be need to ruff clubs--can;t use them for two purposes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|ady: I think impossible  with trumps 4-0   can get back and forth to play diamonds without east getting a ruff  when diamonds thrown on wests hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: no but for sure I would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: (I was not for bidding 3 @D with J942, but for 3 @D if you have one @H less and one @D more)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too !|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on the get go, |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: grrrrrrrrr  -2?|pg||
nt|tomi2: no luck for the schools team|pg||
nt|ady: cant get back|pg||
nt|othered1: right, down in 4, but they're in 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 3 nt brought back 10 imps|pg||
nt|raidouille: 3NT - 1 in OR so 10 imps for France|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: in other words, before the opps can bid anything |pg||
nt|chick: at least when the hand belongs to the opps of the multi opener|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|gips: 10 tricks in 4 spade, 4 spade finishing to the dummy and @D, she has ace of clubs as entry|pg||

nt|sybarra: and he had a shot from the get go :(|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S -300 = 9 IMP for Belgium|pg||
nt|sybarra: well Tim was right,  4 @S bd 3 not a great success|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 13 I mean |pg||
nt|othered1: We look to be playing well ahead of the open room|pg||
nt|ady: spec pointed out correctly    draw trumps ending in dummy  and play a diamond   and return to dummy with A@C  and diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general, methods that automatically get you to the three level on 8-card fits with invitationalk strength have an inherent flaw. this also applies to the standard method of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT-Forcing followed by a jump to 3 of opener's major|pg||
nt|voldenuit: easy board this one |pg||
nt|raidouille: with fatigue, no board is easy aymeric :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: there was a chance if @D Q was played and @C finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: But west didnt see it..|pg||
nt|meikever: For results, pictures, articles and everything you want to know: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our new operator is Tim Heeres, welcome to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: director at the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome Tim - any idea why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good luck!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Undo, operator.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a superior method IN 2/1 is to play a 2C response to 1M as EITHER A NATURAL 2/1 OR a 3-trump limit raise. that lets you out at the 2 level if you want|pg||
mb|4S|nt|werge: How to avoid 450 here? Difficult|pg||
nt|werge: Another BIG hand - 6 @d|pg||
nt|werge: Agood and practical 6 @s - but nobody will bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like a Muiderberg bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes,  but that was the right reward for the bidding and declaring :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it went pass pass pass|pg||
nt|werge: But from where will the 9th trick come? Here it came from the @s-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I understand these players all know each other well, |pg||
nt|baldfriede: There was a time when "forcing pass openings" were very fashionable in Germany, exchanging the meanings of "pass" and 1@c..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: best to lead partner's suit, imho. If it is the killing lead, and you don't lead it, you never hear the end of it|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Of course that could be a bluff ro make me lead anything but @h. :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: to*|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: that's what just happened Mike, Klug was not amused|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the U20's may be a bit intimidated by the older guys |pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not messing around here,  |pg||
nt|raidouille: 4@s old style|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld lead a @h with claire hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: they won;t let us play that over here (will spare you all the diatribe), but players elsewhere are encouraged to explore it|pg||
nt|voldenuit: east has to play trump then |pg||
pc|s2|nt|400 volt: 4@H looks cold, only @S lead and @D back can make it difficult for declarer, but impossible for the defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky place for Ace of @D |pg||
nt|meikever: see pictures of this vugraph table on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|meikever: all information on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl ... results of the last round soon to come..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and of course it avoids all the sarcastic comments|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this immediate 4S response would be a popular choice if playing a strong club|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claire thinks east has 5 trumps that's why she leads a trumps with a singleton |pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: this is another point you need to discuss in case all bids are natural... 1@S forcing, 4sf nonforcing here...?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 1@C was 2+ but 1@H showed an unbalanced hand, operator?|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room already finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: unbal,@C+@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Mieke |pg||
nt|400 volt: I have to leave - See u all and much fun watching vuegraph :)|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead|pg||
nt|gips: 2@H is 7-10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy to miss 4@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Many teams in the German premier league played it.|pg||
nt|chick: we saw it played by one pair this past weekend|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even so, not really advised. you could miss a slam, especially if W ius short in clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: thx Felix |pg||
pc|d8|nt|werge: This will be a long way to 450...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: 7 tricks only, but an odd hand to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@C are becoming popular - were this pair playing transfer respones to an opening pass?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a bit of a thin one |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be really surprised if they didn't bid this one, with S having a fit and all those controls|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S leads what now? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: in my opinion N must bid 2@c to show a better hand than 1nt|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - the problem is NOY to bid 7...!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: NOT|pg||
nt|werge: Even with the @S K on-side, it´s a long way to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: hearts 2-2    spade wrong    but 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is club obvious?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|voldenuit: nice switch @c |pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: good point|pg||
nt|werge: Everything under control|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He could have made a grand try by 5nt|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree -- it looks a bit lazy not to try to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if partner has @dKQxxxx its a good 7@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think south wasnt sure about the 6@D|pg||
nt|xenya: and he might well have that|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - even wutout the @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: without|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: well done to S |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjy: Jan says after the 2 aces, my dad should be watching now, He plays like this :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: Now the way is even longer...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: I think so but not sure.  I was at the other table, so I didn't get to watch it directly.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: wow, NS bid 7@D on board 2. well done them |pg||
pc|s5|nt|voldenuit: a little carole knows claire is doubleton @d with the 8 so he has a @c discard |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, perhaps, but what if N had KJ of hearts and Axx of clubs? then the club switch would let a no-play game make|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: depends on their system, but can be natural. What will be the worst rebid from S in N´s opinion?|pg||
nt|xenya: to be fair, N has to have 6 @Ds for the grand to be good -- not sure S knew he had 6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: can pitch the @H's  and not even take the finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|baldfriede: Well done indeed. Some swing.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect the reverse shows a limited hand within a strong club framework|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: why not ruff a @D with @H10? - overtricks still 1IMP|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: this hand is rapidly falling apart|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: club 7 is not there anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: but was not clear until now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pc|sA|nt|werge: He missed the 13th trick|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: rueful rabbit percentage play, i'll drop the K@H or the 8 will be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yeah, probably the TD came to the table and told them to be faster to avoid a penalty. then operator has no more chances to follow the game|pg||

nt|meikever: Next round in 25 min will be Germany - Denmark|pg||
nt|gips: 2@C gazzilli, 2@D 8+. 2@S nat with @C|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@d 1@c 1@s 1@h |pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: Now they probably get a @S-lead instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: chewing on them?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yea|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: started with that @hk|pg||
nt|werge: But what is the idea with 2 @D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably artificial, FG checkback|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: didnt think S could pass,  bid=insurance|pg||
nt|werge: Merry Christmas now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know exactly why South knew that North has @D's too..|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh  over our heads|pg||
nt|sybarra: or their heads|pg||
nt|pelu: can u tell me about 3@D?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|werge: May be they will rtop in 4 @d, friendly warned by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South, sorry maybe, I have to much confidence in west maybe|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but back to what?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, looks like some kind of checkback.|pg||
nt|ady: good pass    anythin higher  lead to a minus|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|april7: made in open, but I don't know how, must be a present by defence|pg||
nt|werge: Say you accept to loose 2 @C-tricks and the red Aces = 600 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry, passing on 3@C was probably better West said|pg||
nt|april7: that is a way to make it|pg||
nt|werge: stop|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I only play it myself, sometimes, so it's easy to forget |pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: at least he can not misguess @H here :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: checking for a spade fit|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead best for defence|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claim time :) |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: it certainly doesnt look like a rubesohl bid to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops one too high,  needed pass card at 4 nt maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3@d shows @h stopper, asks @s stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: says east|pg||
nt|ady: tricky switch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If nonvul i would always open the E hand. vul is another story. 1st vs. 2nd position in my view is in general a rather overrated factor. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: oh  |pg||
nt|sybarra: so why didnt W just bid 3 nt?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|werge: Best to be said for N/S: It is rather cheap|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: I am confused|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: because he didn't understand it like that i suppose|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: The spped proves, that East will make this...|pg||
nt|werge: speed|pg||
nt|sybarra: something obviously got tangled up in the translation here.... |pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjy: Jan is trying to claim 1down|pg||
nt|werge: Somebody ought stop the board now...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: seems like that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: the defence is easy :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade back and a diamond switch  and 3 rd spade makes like awkward|pg||
nt|raidouille: claim|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: life|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|werge: Now he might make it!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|nt|ady: guessed |pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: @D now - and @H King|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|werge: By the way, the better way to play thios @C-suit was 9 to the Q, because the Jack might be doubleton. Wit the Ace duobleton, you always loose two tricks|pg||
nt|april7: lucky positon of @D and @H suit for declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjy: North complaining about 2 times Qxx @D in East|pg||
nt|gips: not enough|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|ady: down again|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|baldfriede: My partner and I use a slightly altered version of Polish Club, in which we moved the 12-14 NT meaning to 1@d and added a "7 of any suit + a 4-card major and weak hand" meaning to ...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 1@c.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: a trick short?|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx again Wessel,  our terrific operator! |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yw|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of the day here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that was quite a 1NT call|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: thx Wessel (our operator)  for a briliant job! |pg||
nt|tomi2: dont know the VP scale, but I guess this is a 25 start for Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Arifin and Tom, co commentators |pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 6 @H lay-down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the only clue there might be that would East go up @HQ on the first round with AQx |pg||
mb|1S|nt|werge: 3 NT here - but in cloced everybody passed after East´s pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahalim: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back shortly for more bridge from the White House in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Peter :) |pg||

nt|tomi2: thx to our fast kibs! 25-4 it is|pg||
nt|pelu: @H x 3:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to specs,  we always enjoy your comments |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx most importantly to our brilliant operator! |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and not way to come in, here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 min or so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to Mieke,  our web mistress  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but very tenuous|pg||

nt|gips: a 4@S coming|pg||
nt|cindy: too good for 2S|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 4@s now by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Now Big Brother is watching us... - welcome Wald|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he did!|pg||
nt|werge: Seems difficult - loosing 2 !- and 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i think so yes... hope i can get coffee|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Mieke our terrific web-mistress |pg||
nt|sybarra: Rob Myers, UK |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but W should bid again|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|april7: will reach 3NT but will probably go down because of no entry to the @h suit in W|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @c|pg||
nt|pelu: I like that 3@D for the lead - even if it can cost in Red|pg||
nt|raidouille: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: north charging to the rescue as it were|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is just counting HCP|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cindy: so is E|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 2@s too |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Marshall, Aymeric, Cindy and Landry |pg||
nt|raidouille: I wld bid 2@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: East is relaying,|pg||
nt|werge: There might be an entry, if you play a small @d first|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like it also |pg||
nt|gips: mmmm|pg||
nt|ady: club lead     kill the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades ok      this will be difficult on a club lead    but very lucky heart position may still be ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|gips: brava|pg||
nt|ady: chance of swing wither way here|pg||
nt|ady: either|pg||
nt|gips: but now he must play on that spot of @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes. i agree with aymeric that W could try 4S over 2S, but at least an invitational call is certainly warranted|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not I   bid 3S the first time and be done with it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|voldenuit: I have 10@s the king of h and a sing @d I don't want north bid in @d |pg||
nt|raidouille: 10 trumps , bid 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with everybody--heavy for 2S and light for 3S. but it is much closer to 3S in my view|pg||
nt|raidouille: trump law|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: Strange result from OR!|pg||
nt|werge: We should be able to guess the bidding in OR: 1 @d - 1 H - @C -all pass|pg||
pc|dT|nt|werge: 2 @C|pg||
nt|pelu: Belgium again to high|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the 3 @D call was important here |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: Sorry, discard of one !-trick on @s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjy: aah that seems more normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! and I cannor see why W didn´t bid 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: A little, yes|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H actually the best contract,5@C difficult to play especialy on @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East did well to make seven tricks next door|pg||
nt|raidouille: sure Marshall|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: After 4 @D from East, the problem must be to avoid the grand slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: but W never showed a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West showed 3@S-4@H-1@D-5@C, minimum and 0 kc, he showed wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: in Open East was decl -|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: shouldnt east realise Kx @d wasnt worth much|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjy: East asked only|pg||
nt|chick: N has lots of work to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certaionly W could bid game when E bids again voluntarily. innumerable missed opportunities here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now the strange resylt from OR was changed|pg||
nt|cindy: problem is both of them were conservative|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baardolav: beit gårn no|pg||
nt|chick: he can't afford to throw anything except a small heart .. can he figure it out?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|meikever: for pictures of this match, results, articles and info: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|baldfriede: he started them, he of course continued them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: she|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, sorry :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
nt|ady: clear clubs best|pg||
nt|baldfriede: right, "ova" is a female ending for Czech names|pg||
nt|ady: now impossible to make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cindy: either invite conservatively or accept conservatively   |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: happens |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we will resume in 5 min.. |pg||
nt|sybarra: will get coffee then |pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: we will restart any moment now|pg||
nt|bobholl: we still have gerbrand (jacco's brother) as operator ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: good one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: specs tell: 6NT in East!|pg||
nt|sybarra: can put in his pocket (imo)|pg||
nt|ady: with a club|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: now @h 10 is a bad card for declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sQ had been better!|pg||
nt|werge: He only wins, if he ducks in dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: N just sitting back and waiting |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ok ty all|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu in 40 min or so?|pg||
nt|pelu: see u all later :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: don't know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 10 mins past the hour|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: thx all|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|werge: Brave man|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|werge: Should´nt declarer have played two rounds of @H earlier?|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @H and then small Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C after Q of @H|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C lead against 2@C made it much easier (other room)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: things will work out well now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|voldenuit: slt :) |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: but if declarer rise with @hA it´s ok|pg||
nt|meikever: In 1 hour and 10 min the next match will start which is: Italy - Czech Republic U25|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: Overtrick!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North didnt like it.. this is end of round 9, we will resume in 10 min, w|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what could North do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East would get 3 @Hs |pg||
nt|chick: when he leads the @D, E will be forced to give him either he @DK or the spades|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Exitging with a @d will endplay East finally.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: making?|pg||
nt|ady: defence lost their way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes spade was ducked then a club continued|pg||
nt|baldfriede: are E/W female too?|pg||
nt|ady: how many board anyone know?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: has finished thanks all :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx     bye all|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a good criterion to use with "in-between" hands like E has here is this: if i just bid 2M, and pd then makes an invitational call, will that call help me decide? here E would bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S over ANY invitation, so i would bid 3S the first time and be done with it, like cindy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: Exiting*|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: now also only 11 tricks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: he said I would have played differently in 6@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thx all. See you next session 12.15?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: end of round 2, we will resume in 5 to 10 min|pg||
nt|chick: that was very nice play by E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, wd.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all, thanks operator - see you soon|pg||
