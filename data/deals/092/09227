nt|vugrapha2: Hi all from the sunny Gold Coast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 3rd segment of the semifinal of the Gold Coast teams|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: welcome Ed Shapiro |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: North stroking the @SK|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Puts it on the end of his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Joey Silver may join in at his leisure|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Wont enjoy it if he does|pg||
nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Apteker means "pharmacist" in Swedish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the distractions many :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: think a plus here is a good score|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hanlon took the low route here and decided not to stretch for the non vulgame|pg||
nt|sharkey: limited communications between the hands makes game tough|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia, Markku.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any votes for 3 NT by S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Zmud with his 5 crd support had to bid 5@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes @S lead and continuation will force declarer to lose trump control|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: i think defence will prevail unless declarer can drop @CQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: Now Wiz is down, if NS get this right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A technical error by Seamon I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with little defence against 5@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@H ie|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: instead of 4 H|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: I thought so too but they said 12!|pg||
nt|chthonic: If that is the issue, then poor west was left out of the decision making process by the system|pg||
nt|daman: would you have bid 4@S over the preempt Craig?|pg||
nt|daman: or sell out|pg||
nt|viren169: ducking 3 rounds of spades pitch a club might have caught N napping...|pg||
nt|athene: it's common technique when ruffing a side-suit good, not to cash any spare winners, as it just means more rounds of the suit get played, which has to increase the danger of a ...|pg||

nt|golfsquash: May just draw trumps and settle for 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry new operator and cant work out how to enter claim x and concede x|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: saved a trick in defense!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should find the @C lady for plus one|pg||
nt|athene: if east had led the @DQ and west had played three rounds, that would have given declarer a very interesting problem, as a spec points out|pg||
nt|athene: you might ruff with the @S10, playing east for @S7x of trumps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|caitlin: np|pg||
nt|viren169: You cant lend what you dont have!|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5@C dbl par|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharkey: The 2@S opening shutting out NS I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@s theoretically much better.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: as a bid yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sunsamvar: easy @h game here|pg||
nt|sharkey: S's hand awkward; @SQ poorly placed, only 3 @H, and @D not good enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: nice choice of high lead, here|pg||

nt|ahh: true|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how many spades from Eadt?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I predict 1|pg||
nt|athene: people seem to open these hands at the one-level mostly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: but Bob surely this should have been doubled|pg||
nt|daman: double game swing to Scotland on Board 13 to win 16 big IMPs    5@D making in this room and 4@H doubled making in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might be right no one can ever find anything in windows so anarchy reigned |pg||
nt|chthonic: on the pseudo squeeze.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: I played against Adam last week and he doubled me with less than that at the same level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not with the @D fit (i wouldn't have doubled) but it was correct|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat Walshe said to be years ago ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: That 2NT remains fairly constant then |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H one off on a spade lead|pg||
nt|viren169: a simple 4@H may be better|pg||
nt|daman: not the psuedo    the brain cramp by the defense|pg||
nt|chthonic: yep|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slam time?|pg||
nt|viren169: now a slam hand even with 5-0 break!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but look at that spade break..|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: did Coffey "round up" to 15 HCP   or do they play weak NT?|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Tim|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: Nice psyche, but may push them into 4@s which is easier than 5@d.|pg||
nt|james_h: after I doubles his contract and 'thought' about my lead ...|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-15|pg||
nt|viren169: 6N!|pg||
nt|viren169: East has done well with 2N!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: give N/S a problem to solve...|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be a good opportunity |pg||
nt|jallerton: North bidding to at least a small slam here|pg||
nt|daman: they can make the grand salami in @C if they bid it|pg||
nt|athene: @HAK and a ruff, but then south foolishly shows out on the @SA and exposes his partner's @SQ to a finesse|pg||
mb|3D|nt|caitlin: strange psyche though with 3@Ds...if void or singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is OTT Gad|pg||
nt|daman: matchpoint overcall by South    now he's in trouble|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not the happiest of hands for anyone|pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... maybe not!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: qc lead will brighten north's day, |pg||
nt|chthonic: hah|pg||
nt|daman: @C Queen would be an unfortunate lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|caitlin: yes seems more like transfer bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: Rory would they be playing transfer bid here?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am told definitely shows hearts which makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Yes alerted and showing hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cldnt work out how to do alert either|pg||
nt|james_h: he said, Confusis says ... he who double must have lead ... John, you double, what was your leadon that hand?|pg||
nt|james_h: the point is you have no clear lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: they wont play 6N..|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: étrange enchère de 3@s|pg||
nt|viren169: with minus 50/100 result|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should go at least one light|pg||
nt|viren169: yes but I am still young enough to make these bids!|pg||
nt|daman: W will at least get a ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: now it will be difficult to avoid 6@S|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flang: donc égal|pg||
nt|garnetts: great lead |pg||
nt|jallerton: Is it obvious to make it if you are in it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: twelve tricks off the top, but no squeeze and no king of diamonds ruffout|pg||
nt|jallerton: You don't get any useful count on the hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..is it possible that 6 spades could make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I think that's right, not quite sure what the note says|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit unlucky... probably a flat board!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: 7@H reached on board 14 in the open room for a flat board|pg||
nt|viren169: board 15|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted    Northern Ireland in the OR bid the @H game on Board 32 to pick up another 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|chthonic: the diamond situation is so terribe for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: a kibitzer points out that of course on the last hand declarer can't ruff the third diamond, as he has several left :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: thay play 4cM aDiamons might be romming and the suit is waste payer in defence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|james_h: running|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok james try it against me next time and see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would make it on the @S finesse   no such thing as a 1-way finesse for her|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|flang: mais ne peut-on expliciter l'enchère de 3@s?|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 1@h c est texas|pg||
nt|daman: 2-way   sorry|pg||
nt|chthonic: which would not help anyway.  just a spade guess|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: the T of spades needs to be in the other hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|golfsquash: 5@c would be interesting, 2 or 3 down on heart lead, but on a more likely D lead it might be let out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: water's arrived (eventually) but no glasses, grr|pg||
nt|daman: red vs white 1@S was a bad bid|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will require careful play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think thats right, but these positions can be tricky|pg||
nt|viren169: double dummy may be possible without pulling any trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: another @S only 1 down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|james_h: I have many time, thats is my profit margin|pg||
nt|chthonic: well, yes, actually, those would help, because there is one spade pitch on a heart, and another would ensure thirteen tricks.  But not there|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: we're recycling this morning's glasses|pg||
nt|jallerton: North doesn't seem to know about @sA, so grand not really on the picture|pg||
nt|daman: bet you he will finesse E for the @S unless one is led|pg||
nt|daman: did South show the @S Ace with his 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: aha, glasses arriving|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|flang: ah ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: oui sorry 1@h est texas |pg||
nt|chthonic: Anti-Mom percentage|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||

nt|jallerton: No 3NT said I have the red suits stopped|pg||
pc|h2|nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: agree|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: low from doubleton showing European influence|pg||
pc|s8|nt|alpagavp: le 3@s t etonnait mais pas le 1@h :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: and claim|pg||
nt|athene: but @DAKx does give him a problem when it comes to play trumps - he might cash a big one, playing east for an original holding of @SHx|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor defence Q@S |pg||
nt|daman: my Mom is a card snapper...when she starts snapping the cards down, she either has the rest of the tricks or she is beating your contract..|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: not yet|pg||
nt|chthonic: clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|viren169: likley to play A or Q to cater for 4-1 in North's hand|pg||
nt|baldjean: understandable, but wrong|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Some evidence to suggest that 3@s was natural on prev. hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|golfsquash: The cards lie badly, so 4@h may take some handling here.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|garnetts: To make this South needs to play on spades early |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: seems to have been matheson's plan to get this diamond ruff so...|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
mc|10|nt|viren169: what's the best play in diamonds on that combination?|pg||
nt|viren169: A-x?|pg||
nt|garnetts: In isolation two finesses--but not this time --entries won't allow it |pg||
nt|viren169: still not out of the woods yet...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bets line is cask K@S A@C ruff one ruff a spades  then a club over ruff--with K@D restricted choice to drop the queen |pg||
nt|chthonic: that won't happen now|pg||
nt|athene: interestingly, if West had just led a trump there, declarer would still have made only ten tricks i think, because even though he could drop the @SQ, he would have to use the third ...|pg||
nt|athene: trump to get to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: one club can be thrown on the @DA but the fourth round is still a loser, assuming west covers the @CQ|pg||

pc|h2|nt|eamongall: However they played together in recent 3 session National Teams and slipped into victory with a late run |pg||

nt|athene: it's a pretty good 17 count|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: and go quietly if I didnt hear 4@H cue|pg||

nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the same @S lead sees it off|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: As my learned friends Eddie and Micheál point out, there was big action on board 2. Ireland pushed on to 5@c doubled on board 2|pg||
nt|daman: and now a little bit of competition in the auction|pg||
mb|2H|nt|alpagavp: 4@s tranquille|pg||
nt|flang: 4@s pas plus|pg||
nt|alpagavp: la questions est de savoir s ils vont pousser a 6 qui est sur une impasse|pg||
nt|eamongall: As I said .."seems" ... kibitzer indicates 5@Cs should be down according to movie |pg||
nt|daman: 1NT     hrrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|daman: not CRASH|pg||
nt|chthonic: might do well.  Heart finesse onside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I assume 3@D is weak?|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: petit sondage: quel rebid avec la main de zimmerman?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The combination of a weak opening and this method is lethal on this occasion|pg||
nt|chthonic: lead of a diamond would help NS cause|pg||
nt|chthonic: hearts 3-3.  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Bridge is an easy game when cards are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: qui rate|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt it 27-8|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D will show a decent suit and the odd value looking at this |pg||
nt|viren169: with xx in spades, not sure I like 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: say maybe 8-11|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT both minors according to their CC!|pg||
nt|chthonic: If playing CRASH I would show shape and east has an easy 3D bid, pass or correct|pg||
nt|odysseus69: non -Polish action in South|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkm: Just looked at Mesbur's card|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh - |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry got board wrong - board 32 off 1|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: well, he's alerted 5@c as well|pg||
nt|daman: I whack after the alert|pg||
pc|c8|nt|golfsquash: and made it when north led a diamond and slipped up later.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eamongall: The first match of these events is always tough for operators as the venue changes each time and you have new operators |pg||
nt|garnetts: well I am not a fan of either the 1@S or the 3@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: But you make your own bed in this game|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C has to be lead-directing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this seems a normal auction, not much to do in the play either, with @S's sitting nicely|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flang: voilà qui a le mérite d'être clair|pg||
nt|alpagavp: je sais pas ce qu est 3@h mais si c est splinter Multon aurait préféré qu il soit à trefle|pg||
nt|alpagavp: ah ok|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth 4@D now passed ? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way|pg||
nt|chthonic: I see no impediment to making this.. .with overtricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: and @c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: or even worse might they bid 6?|pg||
nt|daman: if NS buy it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|alpagavp: alors c est un peu sous bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: sometimes the players are too fast also :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: nice try !|pg||
nt|eamongall: this is true Bob ...and the vugraph co-ordinator will train any fast players or indicate they are covering their cards|pg||
nt|daman: turn out the lights    the party's over....|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u might be right|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @D Forcing ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they play 2 over 1 game forcing|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D is not that bad (@H finesse)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: dont think W will make 5D|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@C and repeat spades twice if possible on North's hand.|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe things can get so out-of-hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|golfsquash: but no cigar.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|alpagavp: parce ce que il a 20 !!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: good predictor you are :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 2-2 fits at the 5 level are not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2-1 I mean better still|pg||
nt|chthonic: And if playing CRASH, east would not want to save... knowing that west had spades|pg||
nt|athene: the strong NT opener in the other room lost the 4-4 heart fit (or 4-4 spade fit) for a moment, but responder tried "garbage stayman" and got lucky|pg||
pc|h4|nt|alpagavp: pas 15 17|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah I see score has been corrected well done op|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry all - 1st time of doing this.  Difficult to keep up|pg||
nt|jcomyn: np you are doing a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Thanks :-)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he duck this ? a risk involved :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: course he wont|pg||
nt|jcomyn: adam didnt come dowen in the last shower|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: I would pass as I am old fashioned enough to prefer quite sound opening in the first two positions|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|jallerton: it's worth discussing in your partnership whether 4@d in this situation is terminal or save suggesting|pg||
nt|daman: nicely done by NS|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would of course bid 1@S in third seat and likely 4th seat too|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes 1@S in 3rd... and revert back to 1@C in 4th|pg||
nt|viren169: sound openings is a good principle in 1st two positions.|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmm   I now think that with modern methods if you have 5/5 blacks with a couple of reservations about  suit quality 1@S is nearly always best |pg||
nt|viren169: always on with clubs sitting nicely for declarer if needed!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: hmmm surprising|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|daman: looks like +630 unless he gets his feet tangled up|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: +660 if he clears spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: if East clears spades, I mean|pg||
nt|daman: he might have to lose a @D in the wash|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: mmm, maybe so|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but East is still thinking|pg||
nt|chthonic: The trend continues.  Board 16 was twelve IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: another 12 IMPs for Scotland because of the crazy 4@S doubled in this room on Board 32      |pg||
nt|daman: jinx|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  Board 16|pg||

nt|mcarroll: should still be ok|pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: now lots of tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's thinking though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, actually North, think he is worried that clubs might be 4-1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not got the requisite tricks if they are... for certain at least|pg||

mb|2H|nt|othered1: why not?|pg||
nt|me argent: 2 3 or 4@SS?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I like 4 but he may be worried that the double is a single suiter diamoinds and good hand maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: gotta get to game at least, so anything short of 4 doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: May also be worried about slam knowing short hearts opposite|pg||

mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: 1 @H or 2@H with the east hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 1heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: N isn't going to leave it.|pg||
nt|me argent: ???|pg||
nt|othered1: That's "game at least," isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 5c also makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: why not|pg||
nt|chick: good disciplined pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 tricks in hand, no defense.|pg||
nt|robinswr: carruthers should underbid since weinstein is short in hearts and would double with maybe an 8-count |pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@S makeable I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: (of defence)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sharkey: yes - EW needs to get @H ruff to set 4|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: well if patner has a little extra 6@C could be on... if|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: south has @Ca instead of @Ha foe eg|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for eg|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he will play to ruff @H in dummy..|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 10H hardly has the K behind it now has it|pg||
nt|jallerton: strong @c|pg||
nt|daman: with a more prudent approach  Cooke and The Garve could really be ahead in this match   they have held good cards but have done nothing with them|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was convenient to start from hand|pg||
nt|athene: and i guess he wanted to get as many rounds as possible drawn fast (danger of spade ruff(s) )|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so didn't consider hooking the @H10|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: has quite a bit more than he has shown|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: know's partner is short in @C's too|pg||

nt|viren169: yes West know pd is short in @Cs and short of space!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this isn't too surprising and the 5 level is too high|pg||
nt|viren169: too high now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he'll have a little look and sign off in 5|pg||
nt|athene: two spades and @DK to lose here; should be flat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: maybe they play strong Ts and the leader 'Forgot'|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: have they discussed properly how to sign off ?:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chthonic: if declarer finds the qs, six clubs is makeable -- no one would lead a club away from K of trumps, I dare say.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: you can make 6@S if you guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @C invite ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d 4+ spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chthonic: but of course, we play THRUMP|pg||

nt|jcomyn: this has gone too far as the actress said to the bishop|pg||

nt|garnetts: 5@D was an OK place for NS--but 3@C excluded any red suit possibility|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: everything dangerous here|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S looks normal... |pg||
nt|jallerton: now 4@s: a very good hand for a min|pg||
nt|viren169: Defense needs to cash out carefully|pg||
pc|cK|nt|golfsquash: Or if he bid 4@c to show his fragment, he might make 6@c.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: some bidding you have to say|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wow|pg||

nt|athene: the reason is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another jack|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: yes I agree 3@C is looking for a swing type of action|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think west has a problem--I would pass personally--a bid which seems to have lost it value these days|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem for west is that he is bidding 3@S on a balanced hand when partner has passed--can that be right?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Sime will have no problem taking his A@D!|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: need very little from p to make 4@S or 4@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: west must be thinking of cashing clubs and tryin low @S|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes thinking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: someone has overbid here :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||
nt|othered1: he should have help, he bid then and they tend to have @C length (relatively) when they open 1@C, no?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|vugrapha2: So what was 3@C when they have a 4-4 spade fit known|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: @C and a game try, I'd guess.  But west has relatively minimal @C and a dead (f0r thyem) minimum hand, so I'm surprised he would encourage at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: since zmud had shown the powerful 1 @C opener south can place all cards|pg||

nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have doubled if had known that south was good enough to have opned with 1@C |pg||
nt|viren169: Low scoring match... |pg||
nt|daman: it is a huge round robin   I would grind it out until I reached a critical point   important not to get blitzed|pg||
nt|chthonic: Do you go down peacefully, or do you try to do something?  Bid close slams, of course?  Or swing and stay low?  Double a lot?  Psych?|pg||
nt|daman: EW play staht style normally it seems|pg||
nt|daman: that*|pg||

nt|chthonic: OK|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@S or 3@C here|pg||
nt|daman: here comes Cooke now|pg||
nt|daman: do we think 2@C "promises" Hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I think he said "Staymanic"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but not sure|pg||
nt|daman: or Staymanish|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: or Staymanesque|pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't see board one on my movie.... but board two should be another swing -- although minor, comparatively|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, not so sure how easy this is going to be for NS..., depends what 2@D means|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: think just nat positive, not alerted here|pg||
nt|viren169: Nat with 8-11 hcps |pg||
mb|3D|nt|eamongall: board 1 flat|pg||
nt|chthonic: that minus 200 job|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: I see.  thanks|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bobholl: i don't beleive this |pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3@s is a bit pushy|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but the vulnarable 2@C is also|pg||
nt|eamongall: why does BBO not line my suits up opposite each other |pg||
nt|james_h: well at lease he thought about it, but Its reasonablly clear over norths Splinter|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flang: même avant 2009|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C could be done with 3 card suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT is forcing--which is fine but causes this type of contract when North may have a three card suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@h looks to be making so 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still same |pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I want a good match and G Jones should X there in my humble opinion|pg||
nt|garnetts: every convention has a drawback or two|pg||
mb|4H|nt|flang: peut-être estime t-il ne pas avoir à prendre de risques inutiles?|pg||
nt|flang: mais l'ouverture d'1@s était-elle risquée?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This can possibly scramble home, but may be beyond even the great man.|pg||
nt|eamongall: well Mesbur should be fairly good at the playing as its about 37 years since he first played for Ireland |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: might bid 3NT now, which will be ok as it happens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: when would you raise 2@C to 3@C on the above auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: But 2@S is fine--try a @D ruff now then a heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid 2@S here with 1NT forcing--3@C if it showed 4|pg||
nt|garnetts: ruff a @D is best I think|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes|pg||
nt|chthonic: only 3-0 spades defeat 4S.|pg||
nt|chthonic: I see.  Have to scroll|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N seems right now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Matheson unsure about 3@c - says possible cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not sure it is where North necessarily wanted to finish with this hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: defence can't lead trumps so one off (until that lead....)|pg||
nt|chthonic: now it makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: curious not leading from his AKx suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: handy lead too so should be no problem getting at least 11|pg||
nt|baldjean: this lead is helpful though|pg||
nt|viren169: with an unclear 3@C it is always going to end in 3N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: he was afraid of a pass by his partner may be :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in spite off the @C ruff no problem but here :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: how to handle the @C|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that we get identical auctions|pg||
nt|athene: did east just do too much?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eamongall: however I think the 4-1 break and a succession of @Ds is going to kill him off here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|flang: à propos les résultats de la dn4 après 6 tours sur 7 1) bruno alexis 2) eric martos 3) françois werbrouck|pg||
nt|flang: en excellence 1) aymeric lebatteux 2) didier lenfant 3) tony cuenca|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: the problem with bidding like this is, you are making it impossible for your side ever to play in 3@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: good @H guess now|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Is it the vugraph operator who is thinking?|pg||
nt|chthonic: 6 IMPs on two.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|viren169: why not 1 amall heart to the J?|pg||
nt|viren169: @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: well getting @D ruffs is a way of making trump tricks |pg||
nt|garnetts: elopement |pg||
nt|viren169: caters for KQ in East's hand...|pg||
nt|garnetts: The lead is suspicious because it looks like length-often implying trump length|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eamongall: west can hardly be thinking on ACE play |pg||
nt|athene: either you have to sell out to 3@D or you play game|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps you don't mind just giving up on that at imps|pg||
nt|athene: two trumps and a spade to lose from here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so sure about 3H - tempting but probably wrong- partner could have made a second double if any stronger- as it is 4H not without play |pg||
pc|h6|nt|eamongall: sorry rory was typing same thing and same time |pg||
nt|bobholl: thinking was already wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: It was West who was thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Now thinking again|pg||
nt|garnetts: who cares if East has the KQ @H can ruff one anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|golfsquash: 8.75 tricks in the bag now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: that's best i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: next board to score in the open room is the 6@S, taking some time about it too..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: well we must always remember we are watching 4 handed ..and its easy to watch |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Carroll thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: what about?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I don't like to ask :)|pg||
nt|viren169: to take the trick here or take it home with hiom!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's taking it here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|viren169: He's probably got plenty at home!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|bobholl: he still hasn't made it  (@C ruff and @D|pg||
nt|daman: like a prizefight where both swing for all they're worth|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: the @C problem not solved yet|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 6 dias here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe the vg oper was also in break.|pg||

nt|daman: huge|pg||
nt|chthonic: The Great Dealer in the Sky gave me an AK and put me on lead.... I am leading that suit|pg||
nt|daman: things should slow down on this hand  probably 2@S by EW|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|eamongall: and the play too little ...when the chance arrived |pg||

nt|garnetts: Thats not my idea of a weak two   Lol|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about the profitability of 1N with this hand type|pg||
nt|daman: I don;t like 1NT in that sequence     a live auction and you could get pummeled|pg||
nt|chthonic: like minds|pg||

nt|viren169: never give up!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|alpagavp: 2 de chute sur entame A@c et atotu il semble|pg||
nt|garnetts: If the hearts behave ( which they do not)  slam is OK on a non @D lead|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find a diamond lead... but hearts do not behave|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is not a classic Acol two bid--but very close--the J@H would do it |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is a good bid as it shows 6-3-2-2 |pg||
nt|jallerton: not the most testing lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 @H now ?|pg||
nt|daman: we have been doing this for 4 hours with a small break only|pg||
nt|chthonic: more playing strength than double, double being more HCard strength, maybe less distribution, but both takeout|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S? splinter?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S seems normal for now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: looks like it but I can't read the note|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alpagavp: a 4@s contré|pg||

nt|flang: oui certes|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @S lead 2nd chance you mean ?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1st chance no high spade lead, 2nd chance diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H has fairly good chances|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|chthonic: bidding EITHER of their suits is natural... except for their opening major,....|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hmm, not sure, suppose, but in what? @H's|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: perhaps 3@H suggested the J and hence 3N|pg||
nt|chthonic: if it goes 1C - 1H, both of their suits are fair game for us to stake claim to|pg||
nt|daman: what was North thinking when he bid 3NT?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N is enough with South's hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can never work out the odds of a slam--well say 68% for 3-2 --a bit better  as the stiff !J will do--plus the odds on a non @D lead |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: clearly it only promises 3@Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ahh, right that clarifies things more|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: rees won't be enthousiastic with only small @D|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but 6 will come back to him|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes now it will|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is thinking of passing ?|pg||
nt|chthonic: What was south thinking when he bid 1?  |pg||
nt|chthonic: North thought south had a different hand, no doubt|pg||
nt|viren169: ahhhhhhhh... 5-4 in the minors!|pg||
nt|viren169: How could we not have known that!|pg||
nt|viren169: nice bid to have for this hand!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: forgot they were polish club - 1@H may have been 3 cards|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|flang: le contre est très malvenu a fortiori si nord a hésité mais là ils nous faut plus d'explications|pg||
nt|viren169: even with hearts behaving... still not a great slam...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I note on Board 4 that East found the defence to beat 3NT--Dec misguessed--the club blockage meant only one down |pg||
nt|chthonic: or shift|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobholl: where is his 4th @D going ?|pg||
nt|james_h: d lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he has a @H loser|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or swedish club maybe, similar|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: this contract is pretty bad|pg||

nt|bobholl: going to ruff a @D and get overrruffed|pg||
nt|viren169: may be Irish @C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so clearly 3@S would not have been a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: dropping the @CQ shows @CQJ so north can underlead if he needs to get south on lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: but stillmaking|pg||
nt|bobholl: other opnion by declarer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and theres me telling beginners never lead a single trump oh well|pg||
nt|bobholl: opinion|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be a @D to !|pg||

nt|bobholl: 9 after trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry all lost the play on that one.  Went 1 down|pg||
nt|daman: unless their system shows 18-19 in this sequence   then I agree with his bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|golfsquash: making declarer sweat|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|chthonic: EW make 5H.  Can they figure it out?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think this should put off North, but probably not South|pg||
mb|3D|nt|flang: 90 semble score|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: the 2@h opening has helped them |pg||
nt|chthonic: Guess so|pg||
nt|jallerton: W could double cheaply|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, 2S would have been harder|pg||
nt|chthonic: It was just suggested -- rightly -- that over 2S, 4C showing clubs and hearts would solve the problem|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: unless it promises nothing in @C's|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: forcing obviously |pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 1@D showed hearts?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is OK here |pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: I guess 1H = 3-card supp|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well done -- by two specs....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: pass asks for double, then he will pull to show a slam try?|pg||
nt|daman: yes   a piano hand|pg||
nt|viren169: if 2@C is GF... what is the differenec between 2 and 3 spades?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can't see Matheson passing, he has a lot of cards...|pg||
nt|baldjean: South should be aware he has a lot of wasted values in @c|pg||
nt|viren169: he has shown most of them with Hxx and 16+|pg||
nt|viren169: and the club cards seem to be wasted...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: possibly, but even then the K@H is a working card, which he may have downgraded at the start|pg||
nt|viren169: and 4@S is very bad!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: note to 3S is actually "Qxx or better"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that 1D bid is a pointless action|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room south found the fine small club switch after the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: north might well have @CKx |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: now we are playing the boards they started on in other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes 2 over one as I mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm told that Erichsen opened 4@s on the South hand!|pg||
nt|chthonic: THAT might prove worhwhile|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't, but a small doubleton worked just as well when declarer finessed into the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps, with a ruff looming, it would have been wiser to bash out @SAK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chthonic: pass and pull strong?|pg||
nt|daman: Cooke saved the day with that bid|pg||
nt|chthonic: seems so|pg||
nt|daman: yes  pass/pull shows ammo|pg||
nt|chthonic: trying, actually, for slam.  but no help in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: needs a diamond lead though to crack six|pg||
nt|daman: EW can save a few IMPs by sacrificing|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS must lead diamonds|pg||
nt|chthonic: to hold to five|pg||
nt|daman: 470 = 10 IMPs   1049 = 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: 1040*|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1049 would be in range for 14 imps too|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: now 15 minutes on the clock|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, good pass from Matheson|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: 1@H probably showed weak NT or unbal'd with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: David G will be pleased to know that even his granny can make it :)|pg||
nt|viren169: well done N/S...|pg||
nt|viren169: it must have been hard for South to pass!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: 5 @D 2@S 2@H 1@C not interesting|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Coffee time, overtricks.|pg||
nt|chthonic: after Puppet, and a 3D response showing one or both four card majors, I am accustomed to seeing 4D as responder's having both, no slam interest, and 4C showing both WITH slam ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: interest|pg||
nt|daman: 13 more IMPs to Scotland on Board  4|pg||

nt|chthonic: So why would they not want the strong hand to declare?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: 5@S was reached and not defeated in the other room.|pg||

nt|daman: pretty ridiculous really   Coffey was only lead and had not pressure not to lead the @D Ace|pg||
nt|jallerton: and 6@sx is still a cheap save vs 5@h|pg||
nt|daman: on*|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suspect the lead denied a higher honour --so East should try a @D|pg||
nt|athene: it looks natural, if you are going to finesse trumps, to do it this way, to try to protect the heart tenace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chthonic: Each side must defend properly and early to take all their tricks.   But with North declaring, it is easy|pg||

nt|chthonic: any sign of life on Planet North would elicit game by south|pg||
nt|daman: one thing about Matheson    he is not wishy-washy   he has strong views|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 4@S by West would have been best...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: east i think...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: harder to lead a @C|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that is one aggressive 4@D call|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: 3@d = @d !|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 7@C is a fair shot. North knows it can be no worse than a finesse when he has checked keycards (and @CQ)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or a @D!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: plus when partner has passed and there ios little chance that the hand belongs to your side do not give out gratuitous information|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@C.. some sort of drury?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Clearly 4@S is where they will end--and that is bomb proof|pg||
nt|garnetts: after that bid yes--drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 15 minutes remaining|pg||
nt|daman: another 10 for Scotland on Board 6   close to a blitz now|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: David, Would you want to be in a slam based on a lead?|pg||
nt|garnetts: At the risk of being boring yet another convention that I would recommend that my opponents should be reuqired to play|pg||
nt|viren169: seems good odds to me...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry, ignore that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: this is similar auction to  18|pg||
nt|chthonic: Must be something about this hand that we like.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I was thinking of a different hand (18)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 7@c fails the requirements for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|daman: yes   50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: They got to six spades on board 4 -- no control steps -- controversial method, but effective often|pg||
nt|daman: looks as if The Garve and his partner are not on the same page|pg||
nt|eamongall: Ireland will have to go to their bench for next 16 boards|pg||
nt|chthonic: so overtake and lead a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's pondering that|pg||
nt|chthonic: oh, I guess he wonders about spades|pg||
nt|chthonic: the club situation provides a solution if he does NOT overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: maybe win c10 and lead d4|pg||
nt|athene: i was sure that would take them disastrously to the five-level|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: another imps needed for 22-8|pg||

nt|james_h: It is clear to Adam that Pat wants a H switch but he has time |pg||
nt|james_h: might play a spade first|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|chthonic: Odd|pg||
nt|jallerton: another reason not to bid 7@c - may be in game in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: odd is not the word that came to my mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4@D i think was enough|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 5@D is far too much|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D was one too many!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: miracle beginning?|pg||
nt|athene: the sixth trump is nice but you still have a working 7-count|pg||
nt|odysseus69: shiuld the 4C splinter promise extras?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: that's not a miracle|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: gift i think would be more appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: people wondered if Ireland could come back earlier ....|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|garnetts: obviously not this one--hearts make it a silly contract--but the one where they went 3 off in 6NT--I think 6@H was fine|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps West felt that she was obliged to show the diamond control as it didn't raise the level of the final contract|pg||
nt|athene: it's a difficult situation|pg||
nt|athene: most play that if partner is unlimited you are obliged to show a cheap control (ie one which doesn't force your side any higher)|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure east counts as "unlimited" here|pg||

nt|jcomyn: before we get to the last hand, my thanks to all for an excellent evemings bridgwe to my co-commentators the Florins (thats two bobs) Michael James and Martin. And to a valiant ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: operator who wqas marvellous as it was his first time. Well done the plkayers for tremendous Bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Finessed diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 5 minutes left|pg||
nt|daman: last hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: oo, make that 4 minutes|pg||
nt|chthonic: Twelve away, there|pg||
nt|daman: EW have scored 51 IMPS over the past 6 Boards     they deserve a lot of credit   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 50 IMP in 4 boards!|pg||
nt|viren169: Now that was a miracle!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last chance for Scotland to score in this session|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: well done operator i know how difficult it is :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and note Ireland have no condeded a single imp in this half - thats miraculous almost|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well, my ancestral homeland -- Scotland -- seeems to have wrapped this one up.  (Never been there)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@c =8-12, both majors|pg||
nt|chthonic: Now, that is the way to come back -- just play bridge|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2 years ago when the Camrose was won with a match to go and Hanlon seriously fevered ...The other team captains kind of voted that Ireland could use a sub but nobody told ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: Jackson...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobholl: best fit stolen now|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: nice hand for the 1@C system...should see a few relays here|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... unless East comes in!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There seems to be a theme developing here--6@C looks possible using a dummy reversal until yoiu note the spade break|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2 minutes before game time he had to select himself |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: it looks hard to beat +400 on these cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thats something Bob what?|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: no fancy bidding here!|pg||
nt|viren169: 14-16 NT keep them out of 2N or even game!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if he is going to put himself into those kinds of hands, no wonder his play is very good :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can set up four diamonds to go with your three aces...need to find two more tricks from somewhere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks hard to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: have tofind @S ruff |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 3 minutes so we might just beat the clock|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was a weak Flannery Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Mr Bowles hasn't taken notice of the 1@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's ignored it completely|pg||
nt|viren169: dble=take-out or penalty or just values?|pg||
nt|chthonic: really?|pg||
nt|jallerton: and a chance of a partscore swing to EBU here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: more IMP here|pg||
nt|viren169: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: last Board of the first half   Thanks to a great job by our vugraph operator Tim   many thanks to Craig Hemphill for joining me as co-commentator     your insights were much ...|pg||
nt|daman: appreciated      and thanks to the specs for their comments and opinions   it was fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: next set of 16 at 17:35, 30 minutes from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 2 down now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but it will play OK--question is will South buy it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: no questions asked so I don't know|pg||
nt|viren169: penalties I guess!|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: if you don't see all the cards they play you have to guess sometimes|pg||
nt|daman: not the lead that hurts|pg||
nt|chthonic: Looks like a robust one to me...|pg||
nt|athene: well, whichever suit the defence attack will help you out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: 24 leads ?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, it was fun|pg||
nt|viren169: I think he had his eyes closed when he played that hand!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flang: bravo néanmoins aux revenants qui auront su se battre pour renverser la situation et peut-être gagner le titre suprême|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6/7 tricks for sure--best defence just six|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: But this might be bad if NS overstep next door|pg||
nt|viren169: only 300 should be available here for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: next door +430|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chthonic: six on the losing trick scale|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N in the other room...|pg||
nt|garnetts: wasn't looking sorry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: 3h will not be everyones choice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where did that 7 imps come from?|pg||
nt|bobholl: was it really 1@s by ew ?|pg||
nt|athene: a good switch|pg||
nt|athene: the 4th best @S2 lead tells East that declarer has four spdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs to play low to make|pg||
nt|athene: so there's a really big danger that just returning a spade will set up something for declarer - especially with that @S9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: plus, West knows that her partner needs a lot of big cards to have a chance of beating this|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: and thanks to you Eamon|pg||
nt|athene: so she is trying to break up an endplay on him|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: i see it now 1@C double 1@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah yes|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade return, east would have found himself in a lot of trouble, guarding minor tenaces in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: beeter for Wast to duck the d19|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: 3 @H 1 or 2 down ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: d10|pg||
nt|athene: but now restricted choice means if declarer needs to play clubs he will surely lead to the @C9|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: a clear case off lavinthal|pg||
nt|viren169: South wont be happy with the result...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: not a but Q|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chthonic: of course, everything is wrong.|pg||
nt|daman: my ancestral home is Ireland    and I don't like that they are behind|pg||
nt|eamongall: thanks George ....|pg||
nt|chthonic: and now the diamond ace to cut ruffs?|pg||
nt|daman: I would think|pg||
nt|chthonic: and finish the defense.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eamongall: don't worry Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe might be risen from the bench|pg||
nt|chthonic: so much for predicitons|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: a @S i guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 down I guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: that was a poor effort|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: Adam and Pat are very tough players as we all know|pg||
nt|athene: even if you accept that east will falsecard routinely with the @CJ there from @CJ10, it's still more likely he has the @CK than the @C10|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|viren169: J@S in dummy was gold dust for declarer.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: agin 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if it 2 down|pg||
nt|garnetts: The price you pay when 1@C may or may not show the suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: two off now Good defence |pg||

nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
nt|garnetts: But maybe EW will obstruct them|pg||
nt|chthonic: Too late for it.  Shame there will be bidding first|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think Flannery is popular on the other side of the pond|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Here we have the top Welsh pair against 2 of the greats of Irish bridge.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobholl: only 3 @S possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no 8 card fit on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: il faut l'appeler pour garder l'espoir|pg||
nt|daman: West is opening either a  canape 1@D or maybe they play precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: cc's are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|chthonic: I do understand that.  There are pros and cons to every system, and all bids are two edged swords|pg||
nt|daman: might tough to beat 5@D by EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|alpagavp: Qu est ce qui se passe?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: S relieved to see a bid on his right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double is odd--unless it shows support |pg||

nt|viren169: difficult for Garvey to stay out of game now...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does South balance |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I think 1D showed hearts and dble is support|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: i say he should - but I may walk alone|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like it will die out in 2@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly believe that west is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he did|pg||
nt|daman: just kidding|pg||
nt|daman: hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
pc|c2|nt|golfsquash: Pat Walshe is making his comeback here to international bridge.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: here comes 4|pg||
nt|bobholl: what would you bid when partner bids your 6 crd|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must feel he has grossly underbid so far|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, quite a light opening|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: Finally worked out he has a bag of nuts|pg||
nt|viren169: East did well not to push N/S into a making game...|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems easy to beat 5D.  On ace of H, jack is played for a spade shift|pg||
nt|daman: is South's pass of 4@H forcing?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: sprry  pass of 5@D?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Looks like five diamonds will make without difficulty, and that six is possible|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|caitlin: For Camrose Throphy info see http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009.htm|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Declarer has 7 top tricks, but should come to 8 despite the forcing defence.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well probably playing the bust|pg||
nt|viren169: wow...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzkm: not alerted|pg||
nt|chthonic: No, because it is not defined as NS hand after the 2H bid|pg||
nt|daman: new 32 board matches now|pg||
nt|chthonic: but everybody's favorite is 3NT, off two on a club lead|pg||
nt|daman: 16 this set and the remaider shortly after|pg||
nt|chthonic: no.... club suit blocks|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: 1st time for everything!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: guess early|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nobody underleads an Ace in a suit - or do they|pg||
nt|viren169: Although I'm not sure N/W would have got past 3@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when East does not consider a range then either limited values or extra values but no fit- either way it will usually be right to balance|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: raqnge=raise- sorry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|viren169: not easy an easy lead for South|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chthonic: Has to be "our hand" for a forcing pass to apply|pg||
nt|daman: it will  make 3NT for sure|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: comfortable for declarer now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: very !!! well guessed |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|flang: 6@c devrait être appelé|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|chthonic: but with controls and diamond fit, with a known diamond suit west, might try out a 3D exploration.|pg||
nt|daman: unless West takes a first round @D finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chthonic: no apparent reason for that.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If he knew trumps were 3/3 he could have drawn them and claimed at least 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry all lost it - will try again next board|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes but best lead as it turned out|pg||
nt|caitlin: np any idea of outcome?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Will let you know when finished|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 7.5 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: EW: forcing 1C, 5cM, 14-17 NT, 2/1 responses|pg||
nt|daman: he must have heard me Tim :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: here is another flannery hand|pg||
nt|chthonic: but I would not open it|pg||

nt|viren169: Another thin 4@S for E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to get the spades into the auction now...|pg||
nt|daman: if you wouldn't open it I will assume it doesn't meet normal Flannert opening standards |pg||
nt|daman: Flannery*|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mgchat: 11 pas 9|pg||

mb|2N|nt|flang: oui suis nul en maths ....:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: impossible I think|pg||
nt|chthonic: I try to keep the standards up when I play Flannery.  The one major problem you can face with that method is bidding minimal values|pg||
nt|daman: this is hopeless|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: prob 3 down?|pg||
nt|daman: unless of course N tries to get fancy with a @S lead |pg||
nt|chthonic: A Flannery weakness.  It would have kep the opponents OUT of a hopeless 3N|pg||
nt|daman: I was thinking NS|pg||
nt|viren169: another tough hand for E/W to stay out of game...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm 2NT seems a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose north might bid 3@H now and they back into hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising 2NT - 2H expected (by me and wrong as usual)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: WHAT DO YOU BID AFTER 1@H 31/2 @D ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: no guarantee that south will fish out a diamonds in 3NT either|pg||

nt|mrt2000: Interesting|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yes ...|pg||
nt|athene: "to lose one 8-card major fit might be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness"|pg||

nt|chthonic: Of course, if the KS were onside..|pg||
nt|baldjean: E/W missed game here|pg||
nt|baldjean: but a wsobbly one|pg||
nt|athene: yes, Holland can see his partner has the spades over south, and he has the diamonds over north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: eight tricks and no more I suspect|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|baldjean: wobbly|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, the 3-3 spades only yielding 8 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzdr: du coup le 4 de @c qu'il avait def est devenu penalisé et @c le R a fait la levee|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the danger of a double is that a good declarer may use the information to advantage|pg||
nt|athene: just @CA and two trumps to lose here|pg||
nt|athene: so 5 imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here declarer has the clue about how to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: leading low to the @S10 would work out exceptionally badly if east had the singleton @SJ, but that's not so likely|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however the lead guarantees 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: does it? i don't see one down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: Good defence, killing the entry to south|pg||

nt|viren169: Garvey will duck this too|pg||
nt|viren169: South will soon be running out of ideas...|pg||
nt|baldjean: 2 tricks in each suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: giving this some thought|pg||
nt|viren169: has declarer fallen asleep?|pg||
nt|baldjean: or 3 in @s and 1 in @d|pg||

pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: if declarer had ruffed opening lead and played spade to 10 then easy trump promotion|pg||
nt|athene: so you want to lose the @CA immediately, as a Scissors Coup|pg||
nt|athene: play club first, killing east's entry, then lead spade to the 10 |pg||

nt|garnetts: I would have bid 2@C as North earlier |pg||
nt|daman: any help Paul?|pg||
nt|athene: if east ducks the @CQ you can change tack and avoid any club loser; then you don't mind three spade losers, you just have to avoid FOUR|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: here 1@S denies a maj and 1N was weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... best to get in early before East can show their hand|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: wetst knows this of course and passes...|pg||
nt|viren169: thought they may have reached game after that 1@S opening?!?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: against strong club, the card just says double for majors nt for minors.  that's it|pg||
nt|daman: I would bid again|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: All roads lead to 3NT.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does that mean?|pg||

nt|viren169: David, What do you think of the 1C and xfer responses system?|pg||
nt|garnetts: lol even|pg||
nt|daman: immaculate declarer play can bring this in but it won't happen   he needs to run the @D 9 eventually|pg||
nt|chthonic: with which hand?|pg||
nt|daman: West|pg||
nt|chthonic: seems like|pg||
nt|chthonic: and if the east hand showed a nonforcing bid, surely it is on the tippy top for that call?|pg||
nt|athene: really 1@D overcall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: italie 9 irlande 38|pg||

nt|james_h: no sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: South has got that one wrong|pg||
nt|daman: which isn't so far fetched really|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the strong hand east, maybe that is not such a bad play|pg||
nt|daman: part ner could have passed     so he either has a decent hand with 5 @Cs or a bad hand with more      if he has the latter, we have no defense to 3@D   I bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe not right this time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: in holland "everybody"plays niemyer which is the same even 2nt 3nt is 5@S 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Operator, please insert player name for South. We believe it's Mesbur|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Click on South and insert|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Anderson alerted 2C, don't know why|pg||
nt|viren169: could get into all sorts of problems now...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I  wouldn't play them--because it gives the oppo an extra string to their bow--you can bid the transfer suit for takeout and use dble to show a balanced hand--1NT a trick source--|pg||
nt|viren169: what about the advantages of using it... a lot of top players are using it now.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Serves NS right for not knowing their system--and you could argue that North has no reqason to bid 3@C--maybe 3@S |pg||
nt|viren169: best for North to pass before the red cards start appearing.|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view North must assume that South has a decent hand--in light of the pass with reasonable spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S checking opp CC|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree with me I wouldnt dream of bidding on that W rubbish|pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfsquash: good shot at trick 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: But North is simply bidding 3@C knowing that South might have misunderstood--this could be a director issue|pg||
nt|viren169: Game in spades is still unlikley opposite a decent hand, as South had passed 1@C.|pg||
nt|daman: and if he has the former    we have enough ammo to make the partscore|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q of @C saves a trick|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|flang: seul retour @d bat|pg||

pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|james_h: it is tough but you close youe eyes and bid it|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I bet Carvey are not in 3NT - anyone like to take my Euro|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: South was probably unsure about the 2@C in the 1st place...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see some advantages to the method of transfer responses--this has been tried many tiimes in the past--but I still think smart oppo gain more by it|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: if you play 20-22 it is 20 about 50% off the time|pg||

nt|flang: fantoni nunes joue 3sa en nord ce qui semble assurer le contrat|pg||
nt|viren169: I hope so...|pg||
nt|viren169: Now onto a good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but very brief discussion|pg||
nt|viren169: possible swing to Scotland on the last...|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south erred by ruffing his partner's winner there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its dangerous to look away for even 10 seconds|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: peut-être juste histoire d'augmenter le suspens|pg||
nt|flang: attente à l'avant dernière donne ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: suite à l'hésitation de Zimmerman à passer sur 4P, Christian Mari a appelé l'arbitre estimant que le flanc avait été facilité par cette hésitation. Affaire à suivre... donne 15 en ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: attendant|pg||
nt|daman: Ireland*     my spelling needs work|pg||
nt|daman: this is like watching an election   they play 1-4 and we play 12-16   and sooner or later the results come poring in|pg||
nt|chthonic: another competitive hand.  nice|pg||
mb|1H|nt|golfsquash: That may be corrected to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: I notice that the EBU team gained 10 by bidding to the 4@S contract missed earlier|pg||
nt|viren169: 7@H...|pg||
nt|daman: EW should end up in a @H partial|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke making SURE South notices alert of 1D!|pg||
nt|daman: 2 lower|pg||
nt|daman: sorry   2 suits not including the blacks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: likely to get to game here, though|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: would you open South hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 11 tx - must have conceded one|pg||
nt|chthonic: makes four spades.  Can't get to dummy for second finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: good pass by n|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: I assume 2N is any bal'd GF|pg||
nt|daman: petulant|pg||
nt|chthonic: Interesting.  Is 2D a transfer raise of hearts?|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
nt|chthonic: can|pg||
nt|chthonic: ten of clubs|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a simple 3N for E/W via  stayman seq|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does anyone have the cirrent rankings- I missed yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 @D now would be well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|flang: entre larenonce et l'hésitation pierre zim est un héros involontaire de cette fin de finale|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Pat Walshe is getting cautious in his old age|pg||
nt|chthonic: sorry.  but have to bid it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Et zimmerman repasse devant sur cette donne|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: They might get there--quite hard when you have a void in opener's suit|pg||
nt|viren169: key to the hand is the void @S|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|chthonic: Ahhh|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Yes, I would open, 5 loser hand albeit a bad one.|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally prefer not to use LTC until a known fit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alpagavp: ils jouent 3SA en salle ouverte et ont deja 9 levees|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... took the words out of my mouth.|pg||
nt|daman: will need some creative declarer play to bring this one home |pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he wasn't petulant at all, it's very friendly here|pg||
nt|daman: good to hear|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would rather bid 3nt directly with this hand.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes.. I was going to ask about that...|pg||
nt|baldjean: East's distribution looks better suited for NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead but at least 10 tricks in the club break|pg||
nt|viren169: some better players favor 3N on bal'd hands bypassing stayman...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: not doubling is good.|pg||
nt|chthonic: for ew|pg||
nt|daman: 5@S was uncalled for but lucky     he could have made a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: a difficult auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in murky waters here - 3H is a mistake in my never published book|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: I am not at all keen on that 3@S spade bid--4@D higlights the club issue|pg||
nt|athene: east might think that 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|paulg: Current rankings can be seen at http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: vont chuter d'1 ou plutô 2 ce 2 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke rearranging dummy. He put hearts on the left - confused me a bit!|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 28   NS were allowed to play in 4@H   they made for an 11 IMP gain for EBU|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I hate opening rat-bag suits but what can u do|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... |pg||
nt|daman: and then pulled to show power|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: On the surface there are only 8 tricks, so let's see what magic Adam can wield.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|flang: plutôt pardon|pg||
nt|viren169: although 3@S may have helped here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now over 5@C from South  North could bid  5@S which should get 7@H |pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzkm: now on the right as they should be|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree with 4333 shapes not so convinced on 4432 shapes...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: Not the hand for blackwood|pg||
nt|viren169: Is 3@S 1st round support? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: no explanations yet|pg||
nt|daman: or playing strength|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: Simple auction   1@S   2@H   2NT  3@D  3@H   4@D  5@C  5@S  7@H |pg||
nt|viren169: Blackwood hardly ever works when voids are around.|pg||
nt|garnetts: But they have arrived so well done|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... or 5N instead of 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: W thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is thinking of doubling|pg||
nt|garnetts: A double might get South to bid 7NT --could work|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead north could just have won the @HA and cleared the spades, then sat there with winning spades and the @CA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the whole world plays negative doubles- my view is that only experts should use them- there are lots of understated problems and traps for the unwary|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way for declarer to make it then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|golfsquash: weave|pg||
nt|daman: trumps are on the left Tim   |pg||
nt|chthonic: I agree that Forcing pass is "on" in this auction.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as I type North starts to concede|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzkm: I meant - on HIS left ;)|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would not have played the @C Jack to play a @D .....  a @S perhaps|pg||
nt|daman: and maybe I wouldn't have played the Jack at all|pg||
nt|viren169: not seen any analysis or articles on it... anyone know?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: seems down one to me|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S did well to reach the grand here...|pg||
nt|athene: but now, not only did he give a tempo and a trick, he set up a strip endplay against himself for the overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|flang: 1 alors|pg||
nt|daman: can make it now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|caitlin: if not 2|pg||
nt|daman: but the more I look, the more I am beginning to like his 5@S bid      cheap insurance that pays off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: AND access to the stranded @DA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can win the @DA throwing a club, then come to hand with either black winner and run hearts|pg||
nt|athene: eventually north is thrown in to lead into the other black tenace|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|athene: i have to say, just leading from your longest suit against NT is a really good rule|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|golfsquash: there are 8 on top|pg||

nt|viren169: 4@H here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: extra points (as here) favour NT, but 2 majors with E/ another factor is whether the NT bid allows a 5 card major|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: the big bounce how|pg||
nt|chthonic: Borderline.  five losers is a lot for 2, but 5QT... 2C|pg||

nt|daman: Cooke has really got his Alert card working on this hand|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems to have some similarities|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a relay hand     a la Rubin-Becker fro the 80's|pg||
