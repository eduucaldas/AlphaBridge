nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had a strip-sqz endplay against n for +2 if he returned a @d and cashed @cs.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|viren169: Interesting... just the hand I would bid 1@S on...|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||

nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
