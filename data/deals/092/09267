mb|p|nt|hedyg: hey Joey :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: in the light of north's 1@H opener a couple of boards again, i wouldn't have been surprised if he had opened that hand 1@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: pass from south in 3rd is amazing|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: South would have to open 3@d, and at the unfavorable vulnerability it was not too appealing|pg||

nt|me argent: at the 1 level|pg||

nt|hedyg: you are not supposed to talk about yourself :)|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont object to opening 1@H with south|pg||

nt|me argent: 7@Ss anyone?|pg||
mb|3C!|an|5!c's, 3+!h's|nt|yuval10: so 4@h making 12 is a hugh score for Italy|pg||
nt|athene: for a pair who can make 7@S, E-W in the other room didn't do a lot of bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice agreements to have 3@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fit Non-Jump it looks like|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: they must've sense that they're on a roll, they're scoring both here and in the champions league :)|pg||
nt|athene: now that east knows of the diamond fit, he can bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: with what?|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his partner has short hearts, so 4 or 5 spades isn't impossible|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd can have long @cs|pg||
nt|athene: well, he odes|pg||
nt|athene: does|pg||
nt|hedyg: (he does)|pg||
nt|athene: and 7@S is STILL cold|pg||
nt|athene: cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S only showed 3@hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so W might have 2 @hs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he might have|pg||
mb|d!|nt|athene: well now 3@S from east is easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: double is gametry|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: they let him get the spades in cheaply|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know what N needs to bid 4@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now N-S can say goodbye to playing the hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
nt|athene: north shoul dhave been very worried about where the spades were|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West should raise to 4@s now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: 4@H from W now|pg||
nt|athene: and they might back into the small slam|pg||
nt|athene: grand is too much to ask but small is easily possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H still makes|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but if north had just bid 4@H, would east have bid 4@H? well, he migh (i think he should)t, but it was harder|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: would east have bid 4@S sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and as pointed out 5NT over 5@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: so far it has been a very interesting set of hands|pg||
nt|athene: east could pass the double of 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: he has a very nice hand the way the auction is going|pg||
nt|athene: club void is completely monster|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW might "defend" in a making 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: if south is pure, then @S and @D finesses through north are working|pg||
nt|athene: (fit jump tends to deny stray honours outside the two suits)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, I'm suprised he didn't move over 4@h|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: if east passes X of 4@H then west can redouble and now east can see a very low hcp slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess Gerbrand Hop is wondering about it now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: I think Helmich did not alert 3@c to his opponent...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he and me both :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4NT makes, but this is an chance for a double game swing|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: so Franchi doesnt know S has @H fit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63   for results and standing after round 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: yes, and Helmich doesn't either I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mtvesuvius: France U25 in First with 216 VPs and Sweden in 2ns with 204 VPs|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might double 5@S and find himself defending 5@SXX|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: and be saddened to find he can't take any tricks|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Italy is 3/4 and Netherlands Blue is 8th|pg||
nt|hedyg: for a slam N needed KQ@C, K@H and an ace in S, hand with which he would have opened|pg||
nt|yuval10: this hand is going to create some swings all over the field|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you are missing a rounded king it might be onside|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree north can't really expect slam to be good facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 18 IMPs to Italy here|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he'll ruff now, ruff @h, play @s to J and will play A@d and @d to Q |pg||
nt|meikever: of the 12 times this board is played, 10 times a heart game is made and only twice 5@SX, once making and once +2|pg||

nt|yuval10: what's that al about? :)|pg||
nt|athene: fun hand to start us off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS play a 2/1 system with 14+-17 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: nasty board|pg||
nt|athene: north with 12 red cards will try to shut out the spades, but he probably won't manage it|pg||
nt|yuval10: this board is going to break some records for contracts played with X|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: i think we'll see a "X" next to every contract in this board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|hedyg: disciplined pass by E|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT = 5+@S?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably GF relay|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would pass the North hand here... Easier to back in later and not lie about your strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: or 5+ @s, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: i think showing 5 or more @s i believe|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1NT = 5+@S 1RF according to their CC|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: - i believe :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|athene: Helmich already has a sort of bad feeling about this|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 3@s probably setting the suit? obviously that it's forcing to game|pg||
mb|4D|an|*|nt|athene: 3@S natural and forcing, but North must be tempted to pass before the doubling starts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but it really is a Bad Thing to pass forcing bids|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, even if it's right, it's wrong|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes... Ruins partnership trust|pg||
nt|athene: even if it turns out to be the best move on this hand, the loss of partnership confidence in subsequent boards makes it not worth it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s won't get doubled, becuase West cannot be sure of his partner's strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the E-W strength is split so they might well not find a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east could perhaps have considered a double on the basis that the cards are lying badly for declarer|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah, i'm sure some in E will be tempted to bid 2@c, then X is un-aviodable from W|pg||
nt|athene: but it could easily get shipped back to him if he has judged wrong|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is 2 off I think... Potentially a good board depending on how stubborn North is in the CR and whether thay get a 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will defeat this contract a couple|pg||
