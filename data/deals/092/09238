nt|vugrapha2: Hi all from the sunny Gold Coast|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi and welcome to the 3rd segment of the semifinal of the Gold Coast teams|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: What happened to the superstars from Morway.. Helgamo & Helness ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|2N|nt|sybarra: welcome Ed Shapiro |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: North stroking the @SK|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Puts it on the end of his hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Joey Silver may join in at his leisure|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Wont enjoy it if he does|pg||
nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Apteker means "pharmacist" in Swedish|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the distractions many :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: think a plus here is a good score|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hanlon took the low route here and decided not to stretch for the non vulgame|pg||
nt|sharkey: limited communications between the hands makes game tough|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia, Markku.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any votes for 3 NT by S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Zmud with his 5 crd support had to bid 5@S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes @S lead and continuation will force declarer to lose trump control|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: i think defence will prevail unless declarer can drop @CQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Now Wiz is down, if NS get this right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A technical error by Seamon I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with little defence against 5@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in 4@H ie|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mmmakela: instead of 4 H|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 3 unsupported kings?  Can't imagine why.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: I thought so too but they said 12!|pg||
nt|chthonic: If that is the issue, then poor west was left out of the decision making process by the system|pg||
nt|daman: would you have bid 4@S over the preempt Craig?|pg||
nt|daman: or sell out|pg||
nt|viren169: ducking 3 rounds of spades pitch a club might have caught N napping...|pg||
nt|athene: it's common technique when ruffing a side-suit good, not to cash any spare winners, as it just means more rounds of the suit get played, which has to increase the danger of a ...|pg||

nt|daman: unbelieveable|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: David, since when have you invested in a calculator?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: in 3nt you have to finesse @C and make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: now a 4@S for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: my Mom would have doubled 1NT|pg||
nt|daman: EW must play 4 card majors   or at least 4 card @H suits|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: 3 in a row, they should bid slam and claim 12|pg||
nt|cameron_1: X of 2@c would have been takeout so slight hard also thinking it woudl be lead directing vs. West 2M call whcih never occured|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzkm: cc's at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||

nt|henryb: do you respond 1N or 2@d ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: frankly I would give that the order of the boot|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: no gold coins here|pg||

mb|p|nt|flang: c'est reparti|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Mesbur thanks p and says hand very suitable|pg||
nt|bobholl: you could contemplte playing back @H if they duck the 1st trick|pg||
nt|garnetts: well i have got a free one  courtesy of the Bill Gates empire|pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: East has had his fun with 3@D...|pg||

nt|golfsquash: 10 top tricks, will try for a long club for 11, will probably be accredited with 12 anyway.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: May just draw trumps and settle for 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry new operator and cant work out how to enter claim x and concede x|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe this was a big chance to  scrunch this bidding|pg||
nt|jallerton: Your Mom's partner's openings are sounder than Garvey's|pg||
nt|henryb: not that I think there are any particularly successful leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Vow, W managed courage to bid with that hand.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think you are being charitible|pg||
nt|chthonic: A tad.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: perhaps he's thinking it's -50 versus -130 or so|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: saved a trick in defense!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should find the @C lady for plus one|pg||
nt|athene: if east had led the @DQ and west had played three rounds, that would have given declarer a very interesting problem, as a spec points out|pg||
nt|athene: you might ruff with the @S10, playing east for @S7x of trumps|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes prehaps he thought he was playing mp it is true :)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: purely on principle dont you know. If 3Nt is making 3H will be destroyed|pg||
nt|chthonic: helped considerably by the 2-2 heart split|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|viren169: end of defense...|pg||
nt|viren169: more interesting if club was ducked and heart was ducked!|pg||

nt|garnetts: East may have cost his side a trick with 3@D in this instance |pg||

mb|1C!|nt|sharkey: The 2@S opening shutting out NS I think|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: 4@s theoretically much better.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: as a bid yes|pg||
mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|sunsamvar: easy @h game here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: nice choice of high lead, here|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|robinswr: it always bothers me why good players don't use 4spades as rkc when hearts are trump which avoids this disaster|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: they've agreed 13 tricks now on 16 - score corrected|pg||
nt|daman: was scratching the dog and missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: the dog would have made 12|pg||
nt|daman: probably Tim|pg||
nt|daman: E will open 1@H ?  or 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: quick comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: all back now|pg||
nt|chthonic: 1N, if in range|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: both pairs are 15-17|pg||
nt|ahh: true|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how many spades from Eadt?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I predict 1|pg||
nt|athene: people seem to open these hands at the one-level mostly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but Bob surely this should have been doubled|pg||
nt|daman: double game swing to Scotland on Board 13 to win 16 big IMPs    5@D making in this room and 4@H doubled making in the OR|pg||
nt|cameron_1: curious 1@c 3rd in hand from Robson in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might be right no one can ever find anything in windows so anarchy reigned |pg||
nt|chthonic: on the pseudo squeeze.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I played against Adam last week and he doubled me with less than that at the same level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not with the @D fit (i wouldn't have doubled) but it was correct|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat Walshe said to be years ago ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: That 2NT remains fairly constant then |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H one off on a spade lead|pg||
nt|viren169: a simple 4@H may be better|pg||
nt|daman: not the psuedo    the brain cramp by the defense|pg||
nt|chthonic: yep|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slam time?|pg||
nt|viren169: now a slam hand even with 5-0 break!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but look at that spade break..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, a "constructive" pre-empt|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|nt|daman: did Coffey "round up" to 15 HCP   or do they play weak NT?|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Tim|pg||
nt|cameron_1: strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Nice psyche, but may push them into 4@s which is easier than 5@d.|pg||
nt|james_h: after I doubles his contract and 'thought' about my lead ...|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-15|pg||
nt|viren169: 6N!|pg||
nt|viren169: East has done well with 2N!|pg||
mb|1D|an|0-7|nt|viren169: give N/S a problem to solve...|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be a good opportunity |pg||
nt|jallerton: North bidding to at least a small slam here|pg||
nt|daman: they can make the grand salami in @C if they bid it|pg||
nt|athene: @HAK and a ruff, but then south foolishly shows out on the @SA and exposes his partner's @SQ to a finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: that is not my vision of a constructive preempt|pg||
nt|henryb: AKJxxxx would be mine|pg||
nt|mwigor: well there are people who would bid with significantly less at these colours|pg||
nt|mdgraham: David Carlisle suggests that, at the score, South should double |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I agree with him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cmoes with no guarantees, though|pg||
nt|henryb: that could well be, but there is a difference between almost sound and constructive. A matter of language usage, I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Tom said "Reasonable" in his explanation|pg||
nt|cameron_1: 0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: strange psyche though with 3@Ds...if void or singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is OTT Gad|pg||
nt|daman: matchpoint overcall by South    now he's in trouble|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not the happiest of hands for anyone|pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... maybe not!|pg||
mb|1N|an|18-20 bal|nt|chthonic: qc lead will brighten north's day, |pg||
nt|chthonic: hah|pg||
nt|daman: @C Queen would be an unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus any double may well have lead-directing connoctations|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes seems more like transfer bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: Rory would they be playing transfer bid here?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am told definitely shows hearts which makes sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Yes alerted and showing hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cldnt work out how to do alert either|pg||
nt|james_h: he said, Confusis says ... he who double must have lead ... John, you double, what was your leadon that hand?|pg||
nt|james_h: the point is you have no clear lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: they wont play 6N..|pg||
nt|cameron_1: @s can be canape here for them but chose 1nt?|pg||
mb|2C|an|4+ !h|nt|flang: étrange enchère de 3@s|pg||
nt|viren169: with minus 50/100 result|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should go at least one light|pg||
nt|viren169: yes but I am still young enough to make these bids!|pg||
nt|daman: W will at least get a ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: now it will be difficult to avoid 6@S|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: donc égal|pg||
nt|garnetts: great lead |pg||
nt|jallerton: Is it obvious to make it if you are in it?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: 1nt openign 3/4 = 14-16 so i guess this is 17-19 for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's written down 18-20|pg||
nt|cameron_1: (he shoudl read hsi system file ;-)|pg||
mb|2H|an|min|nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I play weak 2@d and Ogust, and over an inquiry by partner I would show a bad hand with a bad suit|pg||
nt|chick: should S play a spade back, or switch to his own suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be hpoing for a spade back and H10@D in North |pg||
nt|henryb: He will be disappointed in the latter|pg||
mb|2N|an|inv|nt|chthonic: twelve tricks off the top, but no squeeze and no king of diamonds ruffout|pg||
nt|jallerton: You don't get any useful count on the hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..is it possible that 6 spades could make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I think that's right, not quite sure what the note says|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit unlucky... probably a flat board!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 7@H reached on board 14 in the open room for a flat board|pg||
nt|viren169: board 15|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted    Northern Ireland in the OR bid the @H game on Board 32 to pick up another 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|chthonic: the diamond situation is so terribe for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: a kibitzer points out that of course on the last hand declarer can't ruff the third diamond, as he has several left :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: thay play 4cM aDiamons might be romming and the suit is waste payer in defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: running|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok james try it against me next time and see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would make it on the @S finesse   no such thing as a 1-way finesse for her|pg||
nt|mwigor: that was an expensive duck|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flang: mais ne peut-on expliciter l'enchère de 3@s?|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 1@h c est texas|pg||
nt|daman: 2-way   sorry|pg||
nt|chthonic: which would not help anyway.  just a spade guess|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: the T of spades needs to be in the other hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: 5@c would be interesting, 2 or 3 down on heart lead, but on a more likely D lead it might be let out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: water's arrived (eventually) but no glasses, grr|pg||
nt|daman: red vs white 1@S was a bad bid|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will require careful play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think thats right, but these positions can be tricky|pg||
nt|viren169: double dummy may be possible without pulling any trumps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: another @S only 1 down|pg||
nt|mwigor: 11 more to england|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|james_h: I have many time, thats is my profit margin|pg||
nt|chthonic: well, yes, actually, those would help, because there is one spade pitch on a heart, and another would ensure thirteen tricks.  But not there|pg||

pc|cT|nt|garnetts: poor defence Q@S |pg||
nt|daman: my Mom is a card snapper...when she starts snapping the cards down, she either has the rest of the tricks or she is beating your contract..|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||

mb|p|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|daman: really descriptive with this hand (he said tongue-in-cheek)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the way this is going Ireland may well be out of the Camrose realistically by dinner time|pg||
nt|chthonic: should not be a problem hand|pg||
mb|3S|an|serious slam try|nt|golfsquash: The cards lie badly, so 4@h may take some handling here.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have been in worse 5@D contracts than this |pg||
nt|daman: when you bid like this you take your non-passed partner out of the loop and become a mastermind       not my idea of partnership|pg||
nt|chthonic: After preempts (of any sort), I like to play following a takeout double that a redouble is a relay to the next suit so that responder can overrule and name trumps.  Here, a ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: redouble would demand 2D from west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c %+ hearts, MAX|pg||

mb|5S|nt|garnetts: make up for it now then David|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: not if W gets in first!|pg||
nt|garnetts: teach MR Bowles a sharp lesson for his 2@H bid|pg||
nt|chthonic: Although EW can show off their technical bidding skills to stay out of slam.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: if pass is f |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: ouch!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sime's written "stronger than 4@h" for the pass|pg||
mb|p|an|F|nt|golfsquash: That 6 imp lead is based on all those 12 trick declarations, so may be nonexistent.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks better than 14|pg||

nt|bobholl: true i would have opened a 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he decided not to|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D would likely have been passed out if he had passed |pg||
nt|viren169: now N/S may get spades back into it.|pg||
nt|daman: hopefully Lavery won't "gild the lily" by bidding game|pg||
nt|jallerton: very tempting to do so though|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|chthonic: making 140.  |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||

mb|6C|nt|golfsquash: Low diamond will be led now|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Eamon Galligan from Ireland|pg||
nt|chthonic: three losers on hand, or do you mean that he has a five loser hand -- with "pure" values?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and if Norman Sellway bid 4S ib OR then it must be right|pg||
nt|athene: west can promote the @SQ but that isn't beating the contract|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is an auto X no? with all those @d values|pg||
nt|chthonic: right|pg||

nt|bobholl: why go for ruffs with 4 @S|pg||
nt|daman: they will make this on the beak|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: To make this South needs to play on spades early |pg||
nt|garnetts: Like now after the A@H |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D was a bit passive... but they have reached game with the aid of West.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hehe well MG and JC earned this swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well they are very small I suppose|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes I think so|pg||
nt|bobholl: right you are and alternatives don't look good|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 18 I mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: which score you mean if south opned 1nt 15-17 it is probable|pg||

nt|chthonic: trust thy partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: well, unless a ruffing finesse develops in clubs for a diamond pitch|pg||
nt|daman: 8 IMPs on Board 15 to close the gap|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: not down yet|pg||
nt|chthonic: If you ask partner's opinion, you should trust it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cameron_1: typical hand for them ... make life hard constantly and eventually you get a pay back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: Might not make--we will see |pg||
nt|garnetts: South has made a good start |pg||
nt|daman: for Ireland|pg||
nt|viren169: otherwise... now 10 tricks available... via 6@S + 1@H + 1@D + 2@C|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: now A and A-x of trumps!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks to be a trick short if Garvey goes up with the A and knocks out the spades|pg||
nt|viren169: short of a entry... |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems to have been matheson's plan to get this diamond ruff so...|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: what's the best play in diamonds on that combination?|pg||
nt|viren169: A-x?|pg||
nt|garnetts: In isolation two finesses--but not this time --entries won't allow it |pg||
nt|viren169: still not out of the woods yet...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bets line is cask K@S A@C ruff one ruff a spades  then a club over ruff--with K@D restricted choice to drop the queen |pg||
nt|chthonic: that won't happen now|pg||
nt|athene: interestingly, if West had just led a trump there, declarer would still have made only ten tricks i think, because even though he could drop the @SQ, he would have to use the third ...|pg||
nt|athene: trump to get to dummy for the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: one club can be thrown on the @DA but the fourth round is still a loser, assuming west covers the @CQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: Declarer is still in control|pg||
nt|bobholl: calculated risk for game|pg||
nt|daman: cannot possibly get coverage given partner didn't bid 3@C over 2@D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|caitlin: with spades|pg||
nt|golfsquash: a spade before the trump?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No Board 18 shows result as -1, whereas it should be -5, John's estimate is correct|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to set up the clubs... but 2@H bid makes it likely that West has long clubs.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: Yes--but the main issue here will be edropping the stiff q@D--which after the over ruff with the K@D should happen|pg||
nt|viren169: I think it is right to cash A@D|pg||
nt|viren169: well done Garvey!|pg||

nt|chthonic: Control step response eliminates that thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: 6 more imps for scotland it seems, bid the narrow spade game on 30|pg||

nt|viren169: I like 3N here with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|athene: South had a choice of calls over 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H, double and 1NT are all possible|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2NT is not a contract which is well rewarded by the scoring system|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Walshe and Mesbur may be short on agreements as they are not a regular partnership |pg||

nt|garnetts: I would try 5@C here as North|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S has avoided spades!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: amazing how often partners seem to bid 2NT when you ope weak in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: NS taking the push here as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: However they played together in recent 3 session National Teams and slipped into victory with a late run |pg||

nt|daman: nope  this is easy to bid and easy to play   fill your cups with coffee|pg||

nt|baldjean: yes. me too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: if he doesn't lead K@H he "knows"all the points|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: only a 6 count....|pg||
nt|cameron_1: 2@c was 8-13 majors can be 44 if max|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This is 1 (or 2) down.|pg||
nt|eamongall: kibitzer asked for Walshe Mesbur ..cc ...my guess is basic something ..maybe somebody who has been here since start knows |pg||
nt|golfsquash: 15-17 NT, 4 card Majors, Dublin 4 style.|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|chthonic: with the queen dropping|pg||
nt|daman: making 5   lets move on|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chthonic: leading stiff or...??  diamond works better|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: A low club shouldn't work now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ahh, missed the first trick..|pg||
nt|mwigor: henry is correct that this time it looks like having a happy ending|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: Might have if East had tried the A@C |pg||
nt|viren169: true, xx in hearts is not good |pg||
nt|chick: and it's always better than -100 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the point about doubling with the South hand on the last one is that if partner bids a red suit, you can pass happily - if s/he bids 2@c you can bid 2@D to show both reds, not a ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong single-suiter, with no extra values implied|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some play differently, of course|pg||
nt|henryb: and as was pointed out, these 4 to 6 imp swings can get very costly over the course of a match|pg||
nt|mwigor: murdoch needs to play @hK now otherwise 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 6@H looks a bit MUDdy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although no MUD on the card - 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|henryb: I know they are popular all over, but I am not fond of second best from bad suits, and vigorously against MUD|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing MUD and 2nd highesy from four small is not really compatible|pg||
nt|henryb: I think at trick 1 partner needs distributional information|pg||
nt|chick: I agree with Henry, and if you ARE playing 2nd best from xxxx, you should certainly have an agreement to distinguish it from top of xxx or the like|pg||
nt|mwigor: this hand may well end up being a good example of why 2NT is a silly contract|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hard to blame jc for pushing on|pg||
pc|c6|nt|viren169: need generate tricks here... |pg||
nt|viren169: ...to...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: this should be a push for sure|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|daman: the "deceptive @C 7"|pg||
nt|mwigor: EW are only entitled to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: another imp for ireland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eamongall: Mesbur at the helm for the 6th time tonight|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think thats the 7th single imp in this match|pg||
nt|mwigor: but wolanski may well make 9|pg||
nt|mwigor: (in 3NT in the other room)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: why is 2NT silly, if they should only make eight?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: looks like he mistimed this|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|eamongall: however this boat is going to spring a leak |pg||
nt|golfsquash: He has played them well, look at the way he made 3@s on board 15.|pg||
nt|daman: forced declarer to play AK of @S|pg||
pc|dT|mc|10|nt|chthonic: sort of made the communications difficult for no apparent reason by winning club where he did?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: 3@C setting the suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: some weird bidding we are wittnessing here|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: as is often the case either both work or both dont|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: and now either 1 nt or dbl but pass?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it wasn't forcing (n's pass) because he's a passed hand, but still p by s is a little timid.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: this auctions shows more than a precision 2club opener|pg||
nt|robinswr: 15+|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: South went down in 3N here on board 2?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: David Stern Here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: kib informs me 2@H response by Versace shows either 3@H or max NT opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: and/or max opening|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|santyclz: With n's pass of 1!x'd he had a @c stopper.|pg||

pc|d8|mc|6|nt|mmmakela: NO N can have lot more in points so never pass|pg||

nt|jcomyn: operator can you get the overall score correct - thats 2 boards wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Board 20 was off 1|pg||
nt|chthonic: landing on one's fee might be difficult.  No clear fits, |pg||
nt|daman: looks like a @C partscore for NS although they migh get beyond that|pg||
nt|chthonic: except clubs, of course.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems to have some more chances though|pg||
nt|viren169: be interesting to see if they bid 1N-3N at the other table...|pg||
nt|athene: he was hoping for a club pitch on the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: then he can afford to lose three trump tricks if spades behave|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I missed trick 2- he put in heart jack?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible Burn's First Law violation coming up|pg||

nt|mdgraham: pass-1NT-2@H all pass |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: part-score hand now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: NS 5cM so 1C can be short|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the same @S lead sees it off|pg||
mb|1S|an|poss canape|nt|golfsquash: As my learned friends Eddie and Micheál point out, there was big action on board 2. Ireland pushed on to 5@c doubled on board 2|pg||
nt|daman: and now a little bit of competition in the auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|alpagavp: 4@s tranquille|pg||

nt|eamongall: As I said .."seems" ... kibitzer indicates 5@Cs should be down according to movie |pg||
nt|daman: 1NT     hrrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|daman: not CRASH|pg||
nt|chthonic: might do well.  Heart finesse onside.|pg||
nt|henryb: you think 1N-2@h?|pg||
nt|chthonic: close decisions on which side should win this part score battle.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: I assume 3@D is weak?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|alpagavp: petit sondage: quel rebid avec la main de zimmerman?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The combination of a weak opening and this method is lethal on this occasion|pg||
nt|chthonic: lead of a diamond would help NS cause|pg||
nt|chthonic: hearts 3-3.  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Bridge is an easy game when cards are right|pg||
nt|chick: if it shows @H+minor, N may well opt for the minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: whoa!|pg||
mb|d|nt|flang: qui rate|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt it 27-8|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D will show a decent suit and the odd value looking at this |pg||
nt|viren169: with xx in spades, not sure I like 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: say maybe 8-11|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT both minors according to their CC!|pg||
nt|chthonic: If playing CRASH I would show shape and east has an easy 3D bid, pass or correct|pg||
nt|odysseus69: non -Polish action in South|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkm: Just looked at Mesbur's card|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh - |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry got board wrong - board 32 off 1|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: well, he's alerted 5@c as well|pg||
nt|daman: I whack after the alert|pg||
nt|chthonic: Ooops.  mea culpa|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and made it when north led a diamond and slipped up later.|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@h presumably showed @h and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: The first match of these events is always tough for operators as the venue changes each time and you have new operators |pg||
nt|garnetts: well I am not a fan of either the 1@S or the 3@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: But you make your own bed in this game|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C has to be lead-directing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this seems a normal auction, not much to do in the play either, with @S's sitting nicely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: frisky raise from Matheson|pg||
nt|cameron_1: at least they found @d fit unlike the other room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flang: voilà qui a le mérite d'être clair|pg||
nt|alpagavp: je sais pas ce qu est 3@h mais si c est splinter Multon aurait préféré qu il soit à trefle|pg||
nt|alpagavp: ah ok|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth 4@D now passed ? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way|pg||
nt|chthonic: I see no impediment to making this.. .with overtricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: and @c|pg||
nt|henryb: and I would have doubled 3@d and led a trump from West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: or even worse might they bid 6?|pg||
nt|daman: if NS buy it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|alpagavp: alors c est un peu sous bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: sometimes the players are too fast also :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice try !|pg||
nt|eamongall: this is true Bob ...and the vugraph co-ordinator will train any fast players or indicate they are covering their cards|pg||
nt|daman: turn out the lights    the party's over....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcomyn: u might be right|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @D Forcing ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they play 2 over 1 game forcing|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D is not that bad (@H finesse)|pg||
nt|henryb: one has to double these people to teach them the error of overcalling on those hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: dont think W will make 5D|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@C and repeat spades twice if possible on North's hand.|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe things can get so out-of-hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes this lead keeps declarer to 5 trumps and the @hA for down 3|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes.  I overlooked the fact that 4S makes.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfsquash: but no cigar.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|alpagavp: parce ce que il a 20 !!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: good predictor you are :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 2-2 fits at the 5 level are not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2-1 I mean better still|pg||
nt|chthonic: And if playing CRASH, east would not want to save... knowing that west had spades|pg||
nt|athene: the strong NT opener in the other room lost the 4-4 heart fit (or 4-4 spade fit) for a moment, but responder tried "garbage stayman" and got lucky|pg||
pc|s5|nt|alpagavp: pas 15 17|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah I see score has been corrected well done op|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry all - 1st time of doing this.  Difficult to keep up|pg||
nt|jcomyn: np you are doing a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Thanks :-)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he duck this ? a risk involved :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: course he wont|pg||
nt|jcomyn: adam didnt come dowen in the last shower|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would pass as I am old fashioned enough to prefer quite sound opening in the first two positions|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|jallerton: it's worth discussing in your partnership whether 4@d in this situation is terminal or save suggesting|pg||
nt|daman: nicely done by NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double has its risks - shouldn't really be doubling for one off    |pg||
nt|cameron_1: a "masterly manful" defence|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: I would of course bid 1@S in third seat and likely 4th seat too|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes 1@S in 3rd... and revert back to 1@C in 4th|pg||
nt|viren169: sound openings is a good principle in 1st two positions.|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmm   I now think that with modern methods if you have 5/5 blacks with a couple of reservations about  suit quality 1@S is nearly always best |pg||
nt|viren169: always on with clubs sitting nicely for declarer if needed!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: hmmm surprising|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: looks like +630 unless he gets his feet tangled up|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: +660 if he clears spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: if East clears spades, I mean|pg||
nt|daman: he might have to lose a @D in the wash|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: mmm, maybe so|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but East is still thinking|pg||
nt|chthonic: The trend continues.  Board 16 was twelve IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: another 12 IMPs for Scotland because of the crazy 4@S doubled in this room on Board 32      |pg||
nt|daman: jinx|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  Board 16|pg||
nt|chthonic: 37-15 on five boards.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|flang: les commentaires de la SO avec 2 donnes de retard sur ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: what if @D 30 and you guess wrong|pg||

nt|mcarroll: should still be ok|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: now lots of tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's thinking though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, actually North, think he is worried that clubs might be 4-1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not got the requisite tricks if they are... for certain at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: maybe diamond now, to cut comms|pg||
nt|henryb: how about for 3 off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: he is now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, that's fine|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|viren169: not so easy after 1@S-2@D or 2@H|pg||

pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: well, not sure that is correct|pg||

pc|dK|pc|h7|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|chthonic: and claim|pg||

nt|henryb: you do have K1085 of declarer's suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzkm: that's my +660!|pg||
nt|daman: they say 1.5 IMPs per board is good bridge       that being said, the bridge is pretty sletchy in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: yes, lucky - I still like my @d play, then can duck club into safe hand|pg||

nt|odysseus69: seemed to have no problem about how to play heart suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Mike|pg||
mb|1D|nt|james_h: was surprised by Pat's 2nt rebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not sure it is that easy a hand to play|pg||
nt|chthonic: Match is getting out of hand.|pg||
nt|chthonic: huge lead now|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think the last one went similarly for scotland too|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: tu as tt à fait raison|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmm   Not keen on this pre-empt |pg||
nt|daman: rhymes with awful|pg||
nt|chthonic: another Flannery hand|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... we can see all 4 hands!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he bid more than I thought!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 10H hardly has the K behind it now has it|pg||
nt|jallerton: strong @c|pg||
nt|daman: with a more prudent approach  Cooke and The Garve could really be ahead in this match   they have held good cards but have done nothing with them|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was convenient to start from hand|pg||
nt|athene: and i guess he wanted to get as many rounds as possible drawn fast (danger of spade ruff(s) )|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so what shd garvey protect with after p p |pg||
nt|cameron_1: 1@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: not good enuf for a 2@d call|pg||
mb|2D|an|.|nt|chthonic: Agree, but...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: so didn't consider hooking the @H10|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: ... Garvey thinks so.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: 2@d call was made in other room too|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Nor do I like 3@S with a flat hand opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|eamongall: 10.4 imps a board :) |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good aggressive bidding by NS, might be a slight problem here for W|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: has quite a bit more than he has shown|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: know's partner is short in @C's too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only 1 imp has changed hands in the last 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: David, what would you do?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT 17-19|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: indeed 17-19, he's written it down for Coffey|pg||
nt|viren169: yes West know pd is short in @Cs and short of space!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this isn't too surprising and the 5 level is too high|pg||
nt|viren169: too high now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he'll have a little look and sign off in 5|pg||
nt|athene: two spades and @DK to lose here; should be flat|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h presumably invitational|pg||
nt|chthonic: But it would be hard to bring spades into auction later.  Now or never|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: maybe they play strong Ts and the leader 'Forgot'|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: have they discussed properly how to sign off ?:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chthonic: if declarer finds the qs, six clubs is makeable -- no one would lead a club away from K of trumps, I dare say.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: you can make 6@S if you guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @C invite ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d 4+ spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chthonic: but of course, we play THRUMP|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|flang: 4@s gagne|pg||
nt|james_h: trap here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this has gone too far as the actress said to the bishop|pg||
nt|bobholl: get dangerously high now|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@D was an OK place for NS--but 3@C excluded any red suit possibility|pg||
nt|cameron_1: now he feels as sick as a parrot because he knows he doesnt have as much as p expects ... luckily it goes 1 off anywya|pg||
pc|h4|nt|james_h: everything dangerous here|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S looks normal... |pg||
nt|jallerton: now 4@s: a very good hand for a min|pg||
nt|viren169: Defense needs to cash out carefully|pg||
pc|h6|nt|golfsquash: Or if he bid 4@c to show his fragment, he might make 6@c.|pg||
nt|bobholl: not too far yet|pg||
nt|james_h: 4c last spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it will be a mighty pass|pg||
nt|james_h: no way|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it's over now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|flang: belel confiance d'Eric Eisenberg avec la dame sèche|pg||
nt|athene: an interesting tactical shot of the @CJ there, NOT the @CQ|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|eamongall: Brian Cleary mentioned 6@S but he is biased |pg||
nt|eamongall: and he can probably see 52 cards |pg||
nt|jcomyn: nah nah nah|pg||
nt|james_h: I take that back with delight|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some bidding you have to say|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Mesbur declares "now there's a surprise"  :-)|pg||
nt|athene: the reason is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: another jack|pg||
nt|cameron_1: sometimes no entry to dummy is a good thing|pg||
nt|sga1: As here|pg||
nt|sga1: If he cashes @s A, it is interesting hand|pg||
nt|cameron_1: is it ? he has too many spades between the hands to strip it down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: yes I agree 3@C is looking for a swing type of action|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think west has a problem--I would pass personally--a bid which seems to have lost it value these days|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem for west is that he is bidding 3@S on a balanced hand when partner has passed--can that be right?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Sime will have no problem taking his A@D!|pg||
nt|viren169: good start... will get a count signal and diamond will follow|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flang: il y a eu misclik|pg||
nt|flang: mari n'a pas duqué je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: si si mari a duqué|pg||
nt|flang: on me confirme|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did the great PW strikes again|pg||
nt|bobholl: will make on a nose !:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: another chance to refill your coffee    this is a piano hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead the @CQ and it's covered, you don't know whether to finesse the @C9|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|golfsquash: With 9 on top, can play clubs wide open|pg||
nt|eamongall: and he does not have two Red shirted Welsh guys waiting to knock his every contract |pg||
nt|bobholl: in 6 you make 6 only chance is JT after the Q loses|pg||
nt|bobholl: will play small @C now i guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Optimal contract, sub-optimal bidding? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and yet another one imp|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @C now migth create problem|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting... East is unlikly to reopen... so you will miss p/s and game most days of the week.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: nice play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzkm: :-)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|flang: ah???|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: pas de misclick|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes, nothing to this one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|flang: okokok|pg||
nt|james_h: That is a tight pass by Pat, but the sign of a top class player|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|james_h: He knows Adam does not have Qxx in spades, or he would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he knows for a fair certainty there are 2 S losers|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzdr: ca peut arriver neanmoins il reste des donnes :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: claire ne misclic jamais|pg||
nt|athene: because west would cover from stiff @CK (obviously) but also @CK10 doubleton|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: What's the bext line then?|pg||
nt|chthonic: ride the spade eight|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: will be in there like a flash :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: problem still there :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alpagavp: mais on veut bien des donnes moins plates :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|james_h: and he cant have Hx in spades as he would have Cueed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: Norther Ireland gained another 12 IMPS on Board 21 with the silly 5@D bid going for 500 in this room and a normal result in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's fingering @sJ|pg||
nt|daman: pulling away slightly now with 6 boards left in the match  (including this one)|pg||
nt|chthonic: west doesn't like this, but all is well|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|flang: pas de vraie bonne raison vu de chez moi (détrompez moi) car @c 3/3 ne sont d'aucune utilité|pg||
nt|athene: but if you lead the @CJ and it's covered, that makes it a bit more likely that west has the singleton @CK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chthonic: shock and relief|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|garnetts: I like to think that in the pass out seat that reopenings play a major role|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: squeeze coming up|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|flang: seul le gisement du roi de @h importe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: so it is N. Ireland by 28 with 6 boards?  |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Can still get 12.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D 3-3 helps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: South created this problem and talked themselves out of diamonds.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sJ|nt|flang: +1|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sga1: so -1 as u sain cameron.|pg||

nt|sga1: said|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobholl: 42 with 4 e would have been well|pg||
nt|james_h: the jury is out I think|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: oops no @H ruff ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: was that right|pg||
nt|garnetts: yuk|pg||
nt|chthonic: show up|pg||

nt|mmmakela: in previous if patrner isn't short in dias they might well have 4 spades so why shd you bid over 2 spades as N|pg||
nt|chick: it's easy to focus on that gorgeous diamond suit (previous hand) and forget to look at the 7 losers in the other 3 suits|pg||
nt|mmmakela: pass gets 95% in bidding panel|pg||
nt|chick: well, 67%, there's 3 of us here :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lol.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: + 19 specs|pg||
nt|santyclz: 95% by talent.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry 18|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to compete with forcing pass.  Both playing and watching.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb 3 mins|pg||
nt|chick: ya, it's interesting, but not very useful for most of us|pg||
nt|chick: I prefer to watch bidding that is at least somewhat similar to what I play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well for those of us in the USA it's quite a treat.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Where multi is considered too confusing to defend against.|pg||
nt|chick: lol  right on!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they skip the board|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will south open the hand?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hanlon discarded a @H to tempt the @H fin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|me argent: i dont c the purpose 2 5@Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: good score for Cayne in open room|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: you mean you will open the South hand ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South likes bidding more than I do|pg||
nt|othered1: lots more than I do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with 1H or 2@H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what is the NT range|pg||
nt|sharkey: view N probably had 4@H not sure I understand Lauria's rationale on the previous hand when he finessed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: if not 1heart then 2hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: south just likes bidding more david|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 4@S is a slim if any hope|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: woinder if 3@S is weaker than pass, since west has shown 4@S with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think the 3@S suggests he has help in clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with 6 losers i wud also try 1 @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: need very little from p to make 4@S or 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|sunsamvar: west must be thinking of cashing clubs and tryin low @S|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes thinking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: someone has overbid here :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||
nt|othered1: he should have help, he bid then and they tend to have @C length (relatively) when they open 1@C, no?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: So what was 3@C when they have a 4-4 spade fit known|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|othered1: @C and a game try, I'd guess.  But west has relatively minimal @C and a dead (f0r thyem) minimum hand, so I'm surprised he would encourage at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: since zmud had shown the powerful 1 @C opener south can place all cards|pg||

nt|james_h: indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: North would have doubled if had known that south was good enough to have opned with 1@C |pg||
nt|viren169: Low scoring match... |pg||
nt|daman: it is a huge round robin   I would grind it out until I reached a critical point   important not to get blitzed|pg||
nt|chthonic: Do you go down peacefully, or do you try to do something?  Bid close slams, of course?  Or swing and stay low?  Double a lot?  Psych?|pg||
nt|daman: EW play staht style normally it seems|pg||
nt|daman: that*|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: +27 now but there is the appeal on  30 to be heard|pg||
nt|chthonic: Oh, sorry, a swiss|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: yes   round robin|pg||

nt|daman: correct|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 4S from PW|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4+@s|pg||

nt|daman: a breather|pg||
nt|henryb: This will presumably push England ahead of the EBU who are involved in a tighter match|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 3@S NS or 5@H EW can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I think only 2@s on best defense|pg||

nt|flang: 2@h en EO |pg||
nt|alpagavp: a mon avis a l etranger beaucoup ouvrent la main de multon|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S or 3@C here|pg||
nt|daman: here comes Cooke now|pg||
nt|daman: do we think 2@C "promises" Hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I think he said "Staymanic"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: but not sure|pg||
nt|daman: or Staymanish|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: or Staymanesque|pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't see board one on my movie.... but board two should be another swing -- although minor, comparatively|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, not so sure how easy this is going to be for NS..., depends what 2@D means|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: think just nat positive, not alerted here|pg||
nt|viren169: Nat with 8-11 hcps |pg||
nt|henryb: @d, @d ruff, @h, @d ruff and defense still gets two black tricks|pg||
nt|chick: that would require a low club lead from Q9x|pg||
nt|chick: yes, you are right|pg||
nt|henryb: no, just underlead of @h honors at trick 3|pg||
nt|chick: EW have now told each other about this possibility, so NS better stay home :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Spears is thinking "Here I have a sensible 10 count, my partner opened the bidding, and the opponents are making slam tries!"|pg||
nt|chthonic: Good to stay out of game with 25HCP.  Not much play with cards all wrong.  Pushy board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eamongall: board 1 flat|pg||
nt|chthonic: that minus 200 job|pg||
nt|eamongall: only 15 fit in the view I think |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chthonic: I see.  thanks|pg||
nt|chick: then he should be able to figure out their slam try is based on distribution not hcp|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't beleive this |pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3@s is a bit pushy|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but the vulnarable 2@C is also|pg||
nt|eamongall: why does BBO not line my suits up opposite each other |pg||
nt|james_h: well at lease he thought about it, but Its reasonablly clear over norths Splinter|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flang: même avant 2009|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C could be done with 3 card suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT is forcing--which is fine but causes this type of contract when North may have a three card suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@h looks to be making so 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still same |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@C 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|henryb: blowing off 800 for a paltry 650|pg||
pc|d4|nt|james_h: I want a good match and G Jones should X there in my humble opinion|pg||
nt|garnetts: every convention has a drawback or two|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|flang: peut-être estime t-il ne pas avoir à prendre de risques inutiles?|pg||
nt|flang: mais l'ouverture d'1@s était-elle risquée?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This can possibly scramble home, but may be beyond even the great man.|pg||
nt|eamongall: well Mesbur should be fairly good at the playing as its about 37 years since he first played for Ireland |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: might bid 3NT now, which will be ok as it happens|pg||
nt|chick: why settle for a big plus when you can gamble on a small one|pg||
nt|henryb: 850|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 850...|pg||
nt|henryb: or 1100 if they bid now|pg||
nt|chick: now S has the chance to turn -850 into -1100|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: when would you raise 2@C to 3@C on the above auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: But 2@S is fine--try a @D ruff now then a heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid 2@S here with 1NT forcing--3@C if it showed 4|pg||
nt|garnetts: ruff a @D is best I think|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes|pg||
nt|chthonic: only 3-0 spades defeat 4S.|pg||
nt|chthonic: I see.  Have to scroll|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N seems right now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Matheson unsure about 3@c - says possible cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not sure it is where North necessarily wanted to finish with this hand :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: defence can't lead trumps so one off (until that lead....)|pg||
nt|chthonic: now it makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: curious not leading from his AKx suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: handy lead too so should be no problem getting at least 11|pg||
nt|baldjean: this lead is helpful though|pg||
nt|viren169: with an unclear 3@C it is always going to end in 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: he was afraid of a pass by his partner may be :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in spite off the @C ruff no problem but here :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: how to handle the @C|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that we get identical auctions|pg||
nt|athene: did east just do too much?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the sort of choice we all love|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|eamongall: however I think the 4-1 break and a succession of @Ds is going to kill him off here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: there, he did it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after the ruff, will West find the heart undrlead?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: the problem with bidding like this is, you are making it impossible for your side ever to play in 3@H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

pc|h3|nt|viren169: why not 1 amall heart to the J?|pg||
nt|viren169: @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: well getting @D ruffs is a way of making trump tricks |pg||
nt|garnetts: elopement |pg||
nt|viren169: caters for KQ in East's hand...|pg||
nt|garnetts: The lead is suspicious because it looks like length-often implying trump length|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eamongall: west can hardly be thinking on ACE play |pg||
nt|athene: either you have to sell out to 3@D or you play game|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps you don't mind just giving up on that at imps|pg||
nt|athene: two trumps and a spade to lose from here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so sure about 3H - tempting but probably wrong- partner could have made a second double if any stronger- as it is 4H not without play |pg||
pc|hT|nt|eamongall: sorry rory was typing same thing and same time |pg||

nt|daman: like a prizefight where both swing for all they're worth|pg||

pc|c9|nt|bobholl: ok no problem now|pg||
nt|henryb: so the Scots converted winning 5 imps for -650 into losing 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think Gold might have played the @HQ there, rather than the jack, just to let Townsend know he'd done the right thing immediately, as opposed for waiting for South to follow small |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: oh. what does it mean ?|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|robinswr: so you treat it as a weak notrump when defending|pg||

nt|chthonic: The Great Dealer in the Sky gave me an AK and put me on lead.... I am leading that suit|pg||
nt|daman: things should slow down on this hand  probably 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|daman: only*|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|eamongall: and the play too little ...when the chance arrived |pg||

nt|garnetts: Thats not my idea of a weak two   Lol|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about the profitability of 1N with this hand type|pg||
nt|daman: I don;t like 1NT in that sequence     a live auction and you could get pummeled|pg||
nt|chthonic: like minds|pg||
nt|daman: I prefer "garbage NT"  showing a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|chthonic: if that is what you call it.... I call it sandwich|pg||
nt|daman: specifically 5-5|pg||
nt|daman: sorry Craig   I meant sandwich   I am tired|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but you never know|pg||
nt|viren169: never give up!|pg||
nt|chthonic: I did not think it would make nine tricks - and did not in the other room.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|alpagavp: 2 de chute sur entame A@c et atotu il semble|pg||
nt|garnetts: If the hearts behave ( which they do not)  slam is OK on a non @D lead|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find a diamond lead... but hearts do not behave|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is not a classic Acol two bid--but very close--the J@H would do it |pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is a good bid as it shows 6-3-2-2 |pg||
nt|jallerton: not the most testing lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 @H now ?|pg||
nt|daman: we have been doing this for 4 hours with a small break only|pg||
nt|chthonic: more playing strength than double, double being more HCard strength, maybe less distribution, but both takeout|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S? splinter?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S seems normal for now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: looks like it but I can't read the note|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: a 4@s contré|pg||

nt|flang: qu'en sera-t-il en SO?|pg||
nt|flang: oui certes|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @S lead 2nd chance you mean ?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1st chance no high spade lead, 2nd chance diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H has fairly good chances|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|chthonic: bidding EITHER of their suits is natural... except for their opening major,....|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hmm, not sure, suppose, but in what? @H's|pg||
nt|henryb: but perhapps they play different systems non-vul and vul|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: perhaps 3@H suggested the J and hence 3N|pg||
nt|chthonic: if it goes 1C - 1H, both of their suits are fair game for us to stake claim to|pg||
nt|daman: what was North thinking when he bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|chick: time to start swinging, I guess|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|viren169: 4N is enough with South's hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can never work out the odds of a slam--well say 68% for 3-2 --a bit better  as the stiff !J will do--plus the odds on a non @D lead |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: clearly it only promises 3@Hs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ahh, right that clarifies things more|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: rees won't be enthousiastic with only small @D|pg||
nt|golfsquash: but 6 will come back to him|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes now it will|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is thinking of passing ?|pg||
nt|chthonic: What was south thinking when he bid 1?  |pg||
nt|chthonic: North thought south had a different hand, no doubt|pg||
nt|viren169: ahhhhhhhh... 5-4 in the minors!|pg||
nt|viren169: How could we not have known that!|pg||
nt|viren169: nice bid to have for this hand!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: forgot they were polish club - 1@H may have been 3 cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: 5 more imps for England|pg||
pc|c4|nt|flang: le contre est très malvenu a fortiori si nord a hésité mais là ils nous faut plus d'explications|pg||
nt|viren169: even with hearts behaving... still not a great slam...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I note on Board 4 that East found the defence to beat 3NT--Dec misguessed--the club blockage meant only one down |pg||
nt|chthonic: or shift|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: where is his 4th @D going ?|pg||
nt|james_h: d lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he has a @H loser|pg||

nt|viren169: may be Irish @C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so clearly 3@S would not have been a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: dropping the @CQ shows @CQJ so north can underlead if he needs to get south on lead|pg||

nt|viren169: and 4@S is very bad!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: note to 3S is actually "Qxx or better"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that 1D bid is a pointless action|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room south found the fine small club switch after the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: north might well have @CKx |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: now we are playing the boards they started on in other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes 2 over one as I mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm told that Erichsen opened 4@s on the South hand!|pg||
nt|chthonic: THAT might prove worhwhile|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't, but a small doubleton worked just as well when declarer finessed into the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps, with a ruff looming, it would have been wiser to bash out @SAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: pass and pull strong?|pg||
nt|daman: Cooke saved the day with that bid|pg||
nt|chthonic: seems so|pg||
nt|daman: yes  pass/pull shows ammo|pg||
nt|chthonic: trying, actually, for slam.  but no help in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: needs a diamond lead though to crack six|pg||
nt|daman: EW can save a few IMPs by sacrificing|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS must lead diamonds|pg||
nt|chthonic: to hold to five|pg||
nt|daman: 470 = 10 IMPs   1049 = 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: 1040*|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1049 would be in range for 14 imps too|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: now 15 minutes on the clock|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, good pass from Matheson|pg||
nt|cameron_1: wow he has to make it to flatten the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: done well in the OR|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: 1@H probably showed weak NT or unbal'd with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: David G will be pleased to know that even his granny can make it :)|pg||
nt|viren169: well done N/S...|pg||
nt|viren169: it must have been hard for South to pass!|pg||
nt|henryb: the opening bid will clue the location of the @dQ and @hK, so declarer likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 90 IMPs is 25-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor old North - nothing he leads will do any good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: 5 @D 2@S 2@H 1@C not interesting|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Coffee time, overtricks.|pg||
nt|chthonic: after Puppet, and a 3D response showing one or both four card majors, I am accustomed to seeing 4D as responder's having both, no slam interest, and 4C showing both WITH slam ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: interest|pg||
nt|daman: 13 more IMPs to Scotland on Board  4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: it was!|pg||
nt|henryb: How many vp is 35 imps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 21-9 VPs|pg||
nt|henryb: that is the EBU lead at this point|pg||
nt|henryb: so England would take a 3VP lead into the last match if both remain the same|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrt2000: well done Mick|pg||
nt|daman: that's an interesting treatment   I like it|pg||
nt|chthonic: So why would they not want the strong hand to declare?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S was reached and not defeated in the other room.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so, EW get away with their mistake in the other room, should feel like a missed opportunity, especially for the NS at this table|pg||

nt|chthonic: two chances.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Garvey asking about carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: three chances if you count single @sK offside|pg||
nt|chthonic: or hook spade|pg||
nt|cameron_1: aparently they play standard count|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but the t looks liek suit pref as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: big decision|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: will be another 1 imp again (the 5th)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chthonic: and EW must not play 2 clubs to start the defense, either|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|cameron_1: mind u ... u shd always sp for spades with that dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|james_h: 11 tricks, put on the kettle|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: as things stand Ireland lead 21-9  England lead EBU 19-11 and Scotland v NI 18-12|pg||
nt|chthonic: I wrote an article for the Bridge World that they "bought" but they have not yet published|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told there is a chance for Scotland on the next board|pg||
nt|henryb: now he will play a @d to the 10, to keep S off lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: not anothjer imps I dont believe it James|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chthonic: and oh no oh no|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: swing city|pg||
nt|chthonic: "insurance?|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's hard to judge who is making what on these double fit hands|pg||
nt|daman: pretty ridiculous really   Coffey was only lead and had not pressure not to lead the @D Ace|pg||
nt|jallerton: and 6@sx is still a cheap save vs 5@h|pg||
nt|daman: on*|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suspect the lead denied a higher honour --so East should try a @D|pg||
nt|athene: it looks natural, if you are going to finesse trumps, to do it this way, to try to protect the heart tenace|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Garvey liked that|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chthonic: Each side must defend properly and early to take all their tricks.   But with North declaring, it is easy|pg||
nt|jallerton: so how would South know that West's 2 is in diamonds not spades?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: may be 2 imps if he takes it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|alpagavp: 9 IMPS d avance a 8 donnes de la fin, sortez les chelems du placard :)|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: Yes, winning judgment by Cayne, in a position where Weinstein bid 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Heart pick will be crucial either finesse follows to make|pg||
nt|othered1: And south is essentially endplayed as declarer may need one more entry to dummy than he has available|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|dburn: winning is as winning does - could not Weinstein have made four?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: so however ashamed you are with your E opening NEVER pass here, pd could have 15+ points with hearts|pg||

nt|chthonic: Not for what they paid........... but now they have the copyright|pg||

nt|viren169: instead they lose 1 imps!|pg||
nt|viren169: nice hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now EBU has taken the lead due to the unorthodox style of Cooke and The Garve|pg||

nt|chthonic: yikes|pg||
nt|chthonic: erase that|pg||
nt|daman: done|pg||

mb|1C|an|16+|nt|chthonic: more coffee, please|pg||

nt|jcomyn: aalright alright I am down 2 euro|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: All corrected by the tech boss|pg||
nt|viren169: nice hand here for E/W|pg||
nt|daman: finesse the @D K you mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 9 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H by North   pass or correct|pg||
nt|chthonic: I see a lot of multi over 1NT ... must be more popular than I imagined|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i thk they play xfers here|pg||
mb|3D|an|!h|mb|4S|nt|bobholl: 5 @C only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: another hand where a finesse working will get yhou 12 tricks--but actually not exciting|pg||
nt|viren169: on a non heart lead... 6@S?|pg||
nt|daman: this has been a long match   easy to get tired Craig|pg||
nt|chthonic: How do you explain a brain disengagement?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @c|pg||
nt|daman: expecially on the other side of the pond|pg||
mb|d|an|"convertible values"|nt|james_h: thank you Operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I guess that's a correction!|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: oui oui ok on peut faire plus drôle mais il faut improviser à) chaque instant et il faut également passer le temps|pg||
nt|mgchat: une donne a swing|pg||
nt|flang: sylvain brethes me rappelle (à raison) que vu d'ouest 5@d est "cold"|pg||
nt|chthonic: any sign of life on Planet North would elicit game by south|pg||
nt|daman: one thing about Matheson    he is not wishy-washy   he has strong views|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 4@S by West would have been best...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: east i think...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: harder to lead a @C|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|4N|an|.|nt|athene: that is one aggressive 4@D call|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 3@d = @d !|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 7@C is a fair shot. North knows it can be no worse than a finesse when he has checked keycards (and @CQ)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or a @D!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: plus when partner has passed and there ios little chance that the hand belongs to your side do not give out gratuitous information|pg||
nt|henryb: After 4@h by North, South was less than energetic in the other room|pg||
mb|5C|nt|viren169: 2@C.. some sort of drury?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Clearly 4@S is where they will end--and that is bomb proof|pg||
nt|garnetts: after that bid yes--drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 15 minutes remaining|pg||
nt|daman: another 10 for Scotland on Board 6   close to a blitz now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke could have passed 4S to demand double from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: David, Would you want to be in a slam based on a lead?|pg||
nt|garnetts: At the risk of being boring yet another convention that I would recommend that my opponents should be reuqired to play|pg||
nt|viren169: seems good odds to me...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry, ignore that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: this is similar auction to  18|pg||
nt|chthonic: Must be something about this hand that we like.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I was thinking of a different hand (18)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 7@c fails the requirements for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|daman: yes   50%|pg||
mb|6C|nt|chthonic: They got to six spades on board 4 -- no control steps -- controversial method, but effective often|pg||
nt|daman: looks as if The Garve and his partner are not on the same page|pg||
nt|eamongall: Ireland will have to go to their bench for next 16 boards|pg||
nt|chthonic: so overtake and lead a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's pondering that|pg||
nt|chthonic: oh, I guess he wonders about spades|pg||
nt|chthonic: the club situation provides a solution if he does NOT overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: maybe win c10 and lead d4|pg||
nt|athene: i was sure that would take them disastrously to the five-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: another imps needed for 22-8|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: -2 a priori|pg||
nt|flang: que sera l'entame? as de @d "file" 4 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unlikely to get it on this hand|pg||
nt|james_h: It is clear to Adam that Pat wants a H switch but he has time |pg||
nt|james_h: might play a spade first|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|chthonic: Odd|pg||
nt|jallerton: another reason not to bid 7@c - may be in game in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: odd is not the word that came to my mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4@D i think was enough|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 5@D is far too much|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D was one too many!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: miracle beginning?|pg||
nt|athene: the sixth trump is nice but you still have a working 7-count|pg||
nt|odysseus69: shiuld the 4C splinter promise extras?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H forcing now|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: 200 donc semble t-il|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that's not a miracle|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: gift i think would be more appropriate|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: people wondered if Ireland could come back earlier ....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the North hand is starting to look good|pg||
nt|henryb: at least better|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: obviously not this one--hearts make it a silly contract--but the one where they went 3 off in 6NT--I think 6@H was fine|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps West felt that she was obliged to show the diamond control as it didn't raise the level of the final contract|pg||
nt|athene: it's a difficult situation|pg||
nt|athene: most play that if partner is unlimited you are obliged to show a cheap control (ie one which doesn't force your side any higher)|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure east counts as "unlimited" here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: akqxx kxxx Axx x|pg||
nt|cameron_1: a well deserved result and well bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|viren169: oops... perhaps not still 2 red suit losers...|pg||
nt|daman: yes   the bench for Ireland can do no worse     The Garve will have to "ride the pine" for the next 16 I suspect|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: going for double figures in one Imp swings and may get it here|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Pessimistic view by Lavery|pg||

nt|viren169: lol... unless East comes in!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There seems to be a theme developing here--6@C looks possible using a dummy reversal until yoiu note the spade break|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2 minutes before game time he had to select himself |pg||
mb|d|an|!h + !s tolerance|nt|athene: it looks hard to beat +400 on these cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: thats something Bob what?|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: no fancy bidding here!|pg||
nt|viren169: 14-16 NT keep them out of 2N or even game!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if he is going to put himself into those kinds of hands, no wonder his play is very good :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can set up four diamonds to go with your three aces...need to find two more tricks from somewhere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks hard to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: this was an excellent result for N-S since (a) they should go at least 2 down and (b) 4@h makes e-w on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: have tofind @S ruff |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 3 minutes so we might just beat the clock|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C was a weak Flannery Roland|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|garnetts: Mr Bowles hasn't taken notice of the 1@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's ignored it completely|pg||
nt|viren169: dble=take-out or penalty or just values?|pg||
nt|chthonic: really?|pg||
nt|jallerton: and a chance of a partscore swing to EBU here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: more IMP here|pg||
nt|viren169: true!|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: last Board of the first half   Thanks to a great job by our vugraph operator Tim   many thanks to Craig Hemphill for joining me as co-commentator     your insights were much ...|pg||
nt|daman: appreciated      and thanks to the specs for their comments and opinions   it was fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: next set of 16 at 17:35, 30 minutes from now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|golfsquash: 2 down now|pg||
nt|garnetts: but it will play OK--question is will South buy it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: no questions asked so I don't know|pg||
nt|viren169: penalties I guess!|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: sorry, he's alerted 2@h but not 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if you don't see all the cards they play you have to guess sometimes|pg||
nt|daman: not the lead that hurts|pg||
nt|chthonic: Looks like a robust one to me...|pg||
nt|athene: well, whichever suit the defence attack will help you out|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 24 leads ?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, it was fun|pg||
nt|viren169: I think he had his eyes closed when he played that hand!|pg||
nt|henryb: now declarer may make 5|pg||
mb|d|nt|flang: bravo néanmoins aux revenants qui auront su se battre pour renverser la situation et peut-être gagner le titre suprême|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 6/7 tricks for sure--best defence just six|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But this might be bad if NS overstep next door|pg||
nt|viren169: only 300 should be available here for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: next door +430|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: six on the losing trick scale|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: swing for Scotland?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|viren169: 3N in the other room...|pg||
nt|garnetts: wasn't looking sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|james_h: 3h will not be everyones choice|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where did that 7 imps come from?|pg||
nt|bobholl: was it really 1@s by ew ?|pg||
nt|athene: a good switch|pg||
nt|athene: the 4th best @S2 lead tells East that declarer has four spdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs to play low to make|pg||
nt|athene: so there's a really big danger that just returning a spade will set up something for declarer - especially with that @S9 in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: plus, West knows that her partner needs a lot of big cards to have a chance of beating this|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to you Eamon|pg||
nt|athene: so she is trying to break up an endplay on him|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|bobholl: i see it now 1@C double 1@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah yes|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade return, east would have found himself in a lot of trouble, guarding minor tenaces in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: beeter for Wast to duck the d19|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: 3 @H 1 or 2 down ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: d10|pg||
nt|athene: but now restricted choice means if declarer needs to play clubs he will surely lead to the @C9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Regardsless, Scotland losing the VP they just gained on 26|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So unofficial result is 25-3 VPs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: a clear case off lavinthal|pg||
nt|viren169: South wont be happy with the result...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: not a but Q|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chthonic: of course, everything is wrong.|pg||
nt|daman: my ancestral home is Ireland    and I don't like that they are behind|pg||
nt|eamongall: thanks George ....|pg||
nt|chthonic: and now the diamond ace to cut ruffs?|pg||
nt|daman: I would think|pg||
nt|chthonic: and finish the defense.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eamongall: don't worry Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe might be risen from the bench|pg||
nt|chthonic: so much for predicitons|pg||
nt|henryb: one of them, not both I think|pg||
nt|chthonic: They need a large momentum shift for the rest of the way.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: a @S i guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 down I guess|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: that was a poor effort|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|daman: Adam and Pat are very tough players as we all know|pg||
nt|athene: even if you accept that east will falsecard routinely with the @CJ there from @CJ10, it's still more likely he has the @CK than the @C10|pg||
nt|chthonic: Maybe a doubled overtrick would help.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|viren169: J@S in dummy was gold dust for declarer.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Next set in 55 minutes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eamongall: Anyway if Scotland win the match ...Good luck to them ..they will have deserved it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: agin 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if it 2 down|pg||
nt|garnetts: The price you pay when 1@C may or may not show the suit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|garnetts: two off now Good defence |pg||
nt|viren169: not sure I would pass with Soutjh's hand...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: that's all for this session|pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks all--some good hands--|pg||
nt|viren169: better to have a x in trump suit to lead it|pg||
nt|viren169: thks all|pg||
nt|garnetts: Thansk to BBO Gad my fellow commentator and the View graph operator who been excellent|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye all |pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: oh yes 3 down is one to wales|pg||
nt|eamongall: only 3 tricks left for declarer |pg||

nt|bobholl: oops there went 1 trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ireland v NI   EBU v Scotland   Wales v England|pg||
nt|Walddk4: England 31 behind against Wales at half-time, so at this point the Camrose Trophy is EBU's |pg||
nt|chthonic: or two|pg||
mc|10|nt|daman: see you all soon|pg||

nt|garnetts: card well placed for NS game is easy|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting hand to start off...|pg||
nt|daman: Welcome back everyone...I am joined today by Craig Hemphill of the United States to commentate on this match   Enjoy|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Roland and Craig|pg||
nt|daman: oh dear   do I see a Flannery hand?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nice save for EW against the heart game for NS|pg||
nt|daman: good thing it won;t make it that far|pg||
nt|chthonic: Good morning.  George, are you here?|pg||
nt|viren169: And we're off|pg||
nt|mwigor: gold-townsend have rushed back from last weekend's yeh cup in australia for england duty in the camrose|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Despite EBU being 4 behind they are probabally in front given they are playign Scotland and England is playign Wales|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: and we're off.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|flang: 6@c|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Good evening all|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome|pg||
nt|garnetts: But maybe EW will obstruct them|pg||
nt|chthonic: Too late for it.  Shame there will be bidding first|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think Flannery is popular on the other side of the pond|pg||
nt|mwigor: england have a healthy lead in this match|pg||
nt|chthonic: With a big risk of 3N going down...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: Here we have the top Welsh pair against 2 of the greats of Irish bridge.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: only 3 @S possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no 8 card fit on this hand|pg||
nt|chick: 57 IMPs is pretty healthy all right :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: il faut l'appeler pour garder l'espoir|pg||
nt|daman: West is opening either a  canape 1@D or maybe they play precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: cc's are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|chthonic: I do understand that.  There are pros and cons to every system, and all bids are two edged swords|pg||
nt|daman: might tough to beat 5@D by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Qu est ce qui se passe?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: S relieved to see a bid on his right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double is odd--unless it shows support |pg||
nt|daman: looks like NS are sacrificing|pg||
nt|daman: hehe|pg||
nt|viren169: difficult for Garvey to stay out of game now...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does South balance |pg||
nt|mwigor: it seems the scottish pair play 1NT as a transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: sorry XX as a transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I think 1D showed hearts and dble is support|pg||
nt|sga1: multi 2@d is loosing its popularity and weak 2@d has become popular now a days.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: i say he should - but I may walk alone|pg||
nt|chthonic: ensuring the set.  A spade lead would have done it, but the defense could not slip.  Now it is easy to defend.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: looks like it will die out in 2@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly believe that west is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he did|pg||
nt|daman: just kidding|pg||
nt|daman: hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|golfsquash: Pat Walshe is making his comeback here to international bridge.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: here comes 4|pg||
nt|bobholl: what would you bid when partner bids your 6 crd|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must feel he has grossly underbid so far|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, quite a light opening|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Finally worked out he has a bag of nuts|pg||
nt|viren169: East did well not to push N/S into a making game...|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems easy to beat 5D.  On ace of H, jack is played for a spade shift|pg||
nt|daman: is South's pass of 4@H forcing?|pg||
nt|mwigor: transfers in low-level competition seem to be very much in vogue atm|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: sprry  pass of 5@D?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Looks like five diamonds will make without difficulty, and that six is possible|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|caitlin: For Camrose Throphy info see http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009.htm|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Declarer has 7 top tricks, but should come to 8 despite the forcing defence.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well probably playing the bust|pg||
nt|viren169: wow...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: not alerted|pg||
nt|chthonic: No, because it is not defined as NS hand after the 2H bid|pg||
nt|daman: new 32 board matches now|pg||
nt|chthonic: but everybody's favorite is 3NT, off two on a club lead|pg||
nt|daman: 16 this set and the remaider shortly after|pg||
nt|chthonic: no.... club suit blocks|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|viren169: 1st time for everything!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: guess early|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nobody underleads an Ace in a suit - or do they|pg||
nt|viren169: Although I'm not sure N/W would have got past 3@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when East does not consider a range then either limited values or extra values but no fit- either way it will usually be right to balance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: raqnge=raise- sorry|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: not easy an easy lead for South|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chthonic: Has to be "our hand" for a forcing pass to apply|pg||
nt|daman: it will  make 3NT for sure|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: comfortable for declarer now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: very !!! well guessed |pg||
pc|c2|nt|flang: 6@c devrait être appelé|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chthonic: but with controls and diamond fit, with a known diamond suit west, might try out a 3D exploration.|pg||
nt|daman: unless West takes a first round @D finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chthonic: no apparent reason for that.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so looks like +4 to ebu straight away|pg||
pc|s7|nt|golfsquash: If he knew trumps were 3/3 he could have drawn them and claimed at least 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sorry all lost it - will try again next board|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes but best lead as it turned out|pg||
nt|caitlin: np any idea of outcome?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Will let you know when finished|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 7.5 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 7.75 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: you can watch any other table with www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ some need flash 9 most don't|pg||
nt|caitlin: Rory will you get it to 8?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Yes I think so|pg||

nt|garnetts: There is a serious point here--apart from sarcastic comments about game bonuses--chasing vulnerbale games is a good idea--the odds favour it|pg||
nt|viren169: Another thin 4@S for E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to get the spades into the auction now...|pg||
nt|daman: if you wouldn't open it I will assume it doesn't meet normal Flannert opening standards |pg||

nt|chthonic: for whom, though?  NS or EW?  Both have double fits.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H from south now is usually played as a one-round force|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I have yet to see a Polish player who does not play the cards well or bids conservatively|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: oui suis nul en maths ....:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: impossible I think|pg||
nt|chthonic: I try to keep the standards up when I play Flannery.  The one major problem you can face with that method is bidding minimal values|pg||
nt|daman: this is hopeless|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: prob 3 down?|pg||
nt|daman: unless of course N tries to get fancy with a @S lead |pg||
nt|chthonic: A Flannery weakness.  It would have kep the opponents OUT of a hopeless 3N|pg||
nt|daman: I was thinking NS|pg||
nt|viren169: another tough hand for E/W to stay out of game...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm 2NT seems a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose north might bid 3@H now and they back into hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising 2NT - 2H expected (by me and wrong as usual)|pg||
nt|sga1: A good slam to reach.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: WHAT DO YOU BID AFTER 1@H 31/2 @D ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: no guarantee that south will fish out a diamonds in 3NT either|pg||
nt|chthonic: kept|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Interesting|pg||
nt|chthonic: And I was looking at EW!|pg||
nt|daman: you like the major suits   fewer tricks to make game|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but is it right to stay out...|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: no harm   no foul|pg||
nt|chthonic: There you go.  Simple as that|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I can confirm that Pat Walshe is North, I dont think Terry Walsh would bit 1@s there|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: A @H I bet|pg||
nt|viren169: this will go plenty off on the obvious @D lead |pg||
nt|daman: West will try the Spade play early because of entry difficulties|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes ...|pg||
nt|athene: "to lose one 8-card major fit might be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: limited auction and known bad breaks- routine expert double|pg||
nt|chthonic: spade slam will make because you can set up the long heart for the third diamond.  Needs finesse and pitch to make.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mgchat: ce n'est pas ce que je voulais dire ))))|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he most certainly would not|pg||
nt|bobholl: not 135 :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Don't say I am not good at prediction Gad :)|pg||
nt|viren169: If ther are good enough to bid... they are good enough to lead!|pg||
nt|chthonic: Of course, if the KS were onside..|pg||
nt|baldjean: E/W missed game here|pg||
nt|baldjean: but a wsobbly one|pg||
nt|athene: yes, Holland can see his partner has the spades over south, and he has the diamonds over north|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so a flat board|pg||
nt|chthonic: and a spade break|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke almost led @d5 out of turn!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrt2000: eight tricks and no more I suspect|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|baldjean: wobbly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, the 3-3 spades only yielding 8 tricks|pg||

pc|d8|nt|flang: peut-être mais c'est pourtant le cas!:)|pg||
nt|flang: j'ai plus d'affinités avec les langues (en particulier la langue française)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: du coup le 4 de @c qu'il avait def est devenu penalisé et @c le R a fait la levee|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the danger of a double is that a good declarer may use the information to advantage|pg||
nt|athene: just @CA and two trumps to lose here|pg||
nt|athene: so 5 imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: here declarer has the clue about how to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: leading low to the @S10 would work out exceptionally badly if east had the singleton @SJ, but that's not so likely|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however the lead guarantees 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: does it? i don't see one down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|golfsquash: Good defence, killing the entry to south|pg||

nt|mrt2000: oppps    lol|pg||
nt|viren169: Defense runs the risk of giving 9th trick in diamonds now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|viren169: lack of entries for declarer...|pg||
nt|viren169: Garvey will duck this too|pg||
nt|viren169: South will soon be running out of ideas...|pg||
nt|baldjean: 2 tricks in each suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: giving this some thought|pg||
nt|viren169: has declarer fallen asleep?|pg||
nt|baldjean: or 3 in @s and 1 in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he's the other side so I can't quite tell!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzkm: he claimed there|pg||
nt|chick: double dummy, it's easy to see he needs to knock out the @HA first, to remove entries to the S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Gold having a deep think ...|pg||
nt|chick: but from declarer's point of view, he has to guess how the @HA and @CK are divided|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flang: ça on l'avait bien compris; ce qui pourra être la cause de leur défaite|pg||
nt|athene: well, 3 trumps to lose now|pg||

mb|1C|nt|daman: should be an animated auction|pg||
nt|daman: Please welcome Paul Tranmer evryone|pg||
nt|viren169: yes Q@S worked well for defense...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: rotten 4-=count pass|pg||

nt|chthonic: Hi, Paul|pg||
nt|daman: he ruffed a @S at trick 4    W knew he didn;t have a @S and his partner had the Queen       that was feeble defense|pg||
nt|viren169: openings are getting lighter and lighter nowadays!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Scotland have sccored 8 imps in two boards - 8 more than they managed in the first sixteen |pg||
nt|chthonic: That will perplex west|pg||
nt|sga1: Again an excellent hand for slam bidding. Cold 6@c.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he doesn't look particularly perplexed|pg||
nt|sga1: Trap pass hoping partners will dbl.|pg||
nt|sga1: Partner|pg||
nt|sga1: East must be thinking|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i doubt E reopens with a X with such shape and points in 2 suits|pg||
nt|sga1: He would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: someone is thinking, tray is still N/E side|pg||
nt|sga1: E is confident that partner has spades. But how much?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: director called that side, don't know what that's about|pg||
nt|cameron_1: then the spot light is back on W as to how he catches up after 2@c comes back to him|pg||
nt|chthonic: South would rescue himself and will bid diamonds over 2C  --|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: so there will be a short delay|pg||
nt|sga1: I am sure yes.|pg||
mb|3D|an|.|nt|chthonic: West had to know spade distribution, so the whole hand was open book|pg||
nt|chick: @H first seemed best to me, even without DDknowledge, because if N had the A and returned a diamond, can still finesse clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: what was 1@D?|pg||
nt|daman: and what was 1NT  while I'm at it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: don't know, looks like some form of spade bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: director is called|pg||
nt|daman: not surprised|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke took 1D as natural, didn't notice alert|pg||
nt|daman: might play in a failing 3NT and missing the @H game|pg||
nt|chthonic: I am looking in vain at their convention card|pg||
nt|sga1: S would be happy to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|chthonic: wow.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: indeed!|pg||
nt|cameron_1: ahhh they might be playign a defence here to 1@c openers|pg||
nt|sga1: Does 1@s shows @s and @d :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: they do play something i dotn have their cc to hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: cc is at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzkm: not sure what ruling is but director has now supplied South with a fresh ALERT card!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 2 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|daman: crystal clear as Jack Nicholson would say|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Dublin style bidding, 15-17 NT and 4 card Majors.|pg||
nt|james_h: lol|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W use xfer responses over 1@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid 2@C as North earlier |pg||
nt|daman: any help Paul?|pg||
nt|athene: if east ducks the @CQ you can change tack and avoid any club loser; then you don't mind three spade losers, you just have to avoid FOUR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but a journey of 57 imps begins with an overtrick |pg||
nt|mwigor: not quite as poetic as the original|pg||
nt|chick: but apropos :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North wondering whether to bid 2NT now|pg||
nt|cameron_1: ahh yes|pg||
nt|sga1: OR bid 6@c.|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so 1@s has a red suit as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke didn't alert 1@s though|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: here 1@S denies a maj and 1N was weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... best to get in early before East can show their hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 @D no 4 crd major and pass good contract reached|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: wetst knows this of course and passes...|pg||
nt|viren169: thought they may have reached game after that 1@S opening?!?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: and Sime now calls for director|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Sime didn't alert 1@c either, EW play natural|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chthonic: against strong club, the card just says double for majors nt for minors.  that's it|pg||
nt|daman: I would bid again|pg||
nt|cameron_1: carnage - mind you even if he know what it shows I think he woudl still pass|pg||
nt|cameron_1: over 1@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|golfsquash: All roads lead to 3NT.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does that mean?|pg||
nt|garnetts: lool |pg||
nt|viren169: David, What do you think of the 1C and xfer responses system?|pg||
nt|garnetts: lol even|pg||
nt|daman: immaculate declarer play can bring this in but it won't happen   he needs to run the @D 9 eventually|pg||
nt|chthonic: with which hand?|pg||
nt|daman: West|pg||
nt|chthonic: seems like|pg||
nt|chthonic: and if the east hand showed a nonforcing bid, surely it is on the tippy top for that call?|pg||
nt|athene: really 1@D overcall?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flang: italie 9 irlande 38|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Will make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|james_h: I saw an articly lately by Grannovetter slating puppet stayman which has convinced me not to employ it any more|pg||
nt|james_h: this is suits up|pg||
nt|james_h: no sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: South has got that one wrong|pg||
nt|daman: which isn't so far fetched really|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the strong hand east, maybe that is not such a bad play|pg||
nt|daman: part ner could have passed     so he either has a decent hand with 5 @Cs or a bad hand with more      if he has the latter, we have no defense to 3@D   I bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe not right this time|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: in holland "everybody"plays niemyer which is the same even 2nt 3nt is 5@S 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to see this making even on this lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt 3nt is called bier convention you have to buy a beer when you forget so it happens :) now and then|pg||
nt|james_h: -2 I boldly predict :)|pg||
nt|james_h: I like that agreement Bob |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Operator, please insert player name for South. We believe it's Mesbur|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Click on South and insert|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Anderson alerted 2C, don't know why|pg||
nt|viren169: could get into all sorts of problems now...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I  wouldn't play them--because it gives the oppo an extra string to their bow--you can bid the transfer suit for takeout and use dble to show a balanced hand--1NT a trick source--|pg||
nt|viren169: what about the advantages of using it... a lot of top players are using it now.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Serves NS right for not knowing their system--and you could argue that North has no reqason to bid 3@C--maybe 3@S |pg||
nt|viren169: best for North to pass before the red cards start appearing.|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view North must assume that South has a decent hand--in light of the pass with reasonable spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S checking opp CC|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree with me I wouldnt dream of bidding on that W rubbish|pg||
pc|c2|nt|golfsquash: good shot at trick 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: But North is simply bidding 3@C knowing that South might have misunderstood--this could be a director issue|pg||
nt|viren169: Game in spades is still unlikley opposite a decent hand, as South had passed 1@C.|pg||
nt|daman: and if he has the former    we have enough ammo to make the partscore|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: Q of @C saves a trick|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
nt|james_h: I open 2nt all day|pg||
nt|james_h: and let the defence work it out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: W I am talking about|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looking at the fillers its not a bad 4 count - and pd with more than a minimum is not going to be happy with 2NT+1 John|pg||

nt|flang: on peut penser que pierre ne se trompera pas en main à l'as de @h|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes Martin but I'm sure 2NT shows 20 exactly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|nt|james_h: it is tough but you close youe eyes and bid it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apparently not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 20-22|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I bet Carvey are not in 3NT - anyone like to take my Euro|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: South was probably unsure about the 2@C in the 1st place...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can see some advantages to the method of transfer responses--this has been tried many tiimes in the past--but I still think smart oppo gain more by it|pg||
nt|viren169: not right this time...|pg||
nt|chthonic: I remember commentating yesterday and think this pair had a director call on a similar auction...... Hope my memory is correct.  Their card says X for majors and NT minors, but it ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: seems more complex than that.  But then, was 1C artificial here?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right bet you they stay out of it one big euro|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play 20-22 it is 20 about 50% off the time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: most would open 1 spade - with weak 5-5 and passed partner|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: would have been easy for EW to overbid this one - as it is, they have stopped safely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chthonic: Or east could do more.|pg||

nt|golfsquash: No ducking of the second diamond, for fear of a heart through.|pg||
nt|daman: standard signalling obviously|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so before the director gets his hands on this it will be 14 imps to ebu|pg||
pc|dT|nt|viren169: No harm done as E/W has 3@D on... and few 50s here instead!|pg||
nt|chthonic: Maybe even double|pg||

nt|chthonic: OK, so that is what EW are playing?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: 11 tx - must have conceded one|pg||
nt|chthonic: makes four spades.  Can't get to dummy for second finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C could be three cards|pg||
mb|d|an|4!h|nt|bobholl: good pass by n|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: I assume 2N is any bal'd GF|pg||
nt|daman: petulant|pg||
nt|chthonic: Interesting.  Is 2D a transfer raise of hearts?|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes.|pg||
nt|chthonic: can|pg||
nt|chthonic: ten of clubs|pg||
nt|viren169: Now a simple 3N for E/W via  stayman seq|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does anyone have the cirrent rankings- I missed yesterday|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke's note to his double appears to say "4@d" not @h ... hmm|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 2 @D now would be well|pg||
nt|mwigor: gold's 2@h may win the auction|pg||
nt|mwigor: looks like the defence should beat him easily enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|flang: entre larenonce et l'hésitation pierre zim est un héros involontaire de cette fin de finale|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Pat Walshe is getting cautious in his old age|pg||
nt|chthonic: sorry.  but have to bid it.|pg||
nt|mwigor: i suppose a @d lead might have been poor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|alpagavp: Et zimmerman repasse devant sur cette donne|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: They might get there--quite hard when you have a void in opener's suit|pg||
nt|viren169: key to the hand is the void @S|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|chthonic: Ahhh|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Yes, I would open, 5 loser hand albeit a bad one.|pg||
nt|caitlin: I personally prefer not to use LTC until a known fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: ils jouent 3SA en salle ouverte et ont deja 9 levees|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... took the words out of my mouth.|pg||
nt|daman: will need some creative declarer play to bring this one home |pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: he wasn't petulant at all, it's very friendly here|pg||
nt|daman: good to hear|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would rather bid 3nt directly with this hand.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes.. I was going to ask about that...|pg||
nt|baldjean: East's distribution looks better suited for NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead but at least 10 tricks in the club break|pg||
nt|viren169: some better players favor 3N on bal'd hands bypassing stayman...|pg||
nt|sga1: I doubt EW can match aggressiveness of EW players in OR.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chthonic: not doubling is good.|pg||
nt|chthonic: for ew|pg||
nt|daman: 5@S was uncalled for but lucky     he could have made a forcing pass|pg||
nt|athene: a difficult auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in murky waters here - 3H is a mistake in my never published book|pg||
nt|chthonic: wih a desire o compete and without misinformation, it would seem more likely west would double 1H, so the misinformation might hurt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: I am not at all keen on that 3@S spade bid--4@D higlights the club issue|pg||
nt|athene: east might think that 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|paulg: Current rankings can be seen at http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm|pg||
pc|c2|nt|flang: vont chuter d'1 ou plutô 2 ce 2 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke rearranging dummy. He put hearts on the left - confused me a bit!|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 28   NS were allowed to play in 4@H   they made for an 11 IMP gain for EBU|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this could be one of those hands where whoever declares goes down|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I hate opening rat-bag suits but what can u do|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... |pg||
nt|daman: and then pulled to show power|pg||
nt|chthonic: because diamonds would be found ew|pg||
pc|h2|nt|golfsquash: On the surface there are only 8 tricks, so let's see what magic Adam can wield.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|flang: plutôt pardon|pg||
nt|viren169: although 3@S may have helped here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now over 5@C from South  North could bid  5@S which should get 7@H |pg||
nt|mwigor: even though partner bid 1@s the Ax lead is not without risk|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzkm: now on the right as they should be|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree with 4333 shapes not so convinced on 4432 shapes...|pg||
nt|mwigor: on this hand its ok though|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not the hand for blackwood|pg||
nt|viren169: Is 3@S 1st round support? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: no explanations yet|pg||
nt|daman: or playing strength|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: Simple auction   1@S   2@H   2NT  3@D  3@H   4@D  5@C  5@S  7@H |pg||
nt|viren169: Blackwood hardly ever works when voids are around.|pg||
nt|garnetts: But they have arrived so well done|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... or 5N instead of 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: W thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is thinking of doubling|pg||
nt|garnetts: A double might get South to bid 7NT --could work|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead north could just have won the @HA and cleared the spades, then sat there with winning spades and the @CA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the whole world plays negative doubles- my view is that only experts should use them- there are lots of understated problems and traps for the unwary|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way for declarer to make it then|pg||
nt|chthonic: was it misexplained?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: it looks like it but the note isn't 100% clear for me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|golfsquash: weave|pg||
nt|daman: trumps are on the left Tim   |pg||
nt|chthonic: I agree that Forcing pass is "on" in this auction.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as I type North starts to concede|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzkm: I meant - on HIS left ;)|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would not have played the @C Jack to play a @D .....  a @S perhaps|pg||
nt|daman: and maybe I wouldn't have played the Jack at all|pg||
nt|viren169: not seen any analysis or articles on it... anyone know?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|caitlin: seems down one to me|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S did well to reach the grand here...|pg||
nt|athene: but now, not only did he give a tempo and a trick, he set up a strip endplay against himself for the overtrick|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|chick: that 1@S bid could easily have been made on @S5432|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even worse than that|pg||
nt|mwigor: worse would be something like QTxx and declarer with KJx|pg||
nt|chick: lol  ok if you think that's worse :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: if partner has 5432 you only ever had one trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|flang: 1 alors|pg||
nt|daman: can make it now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|caitlin: if not 2|pg||
nt|daman: but the more I look, the more I am beginning to like his 5@S bid      cheap insurance that pays off|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: AND access to the stranded @DA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can win the @DA throwing a club, then come to hand with either black winner and run hearts|pg||
nt|athene: eventually north is thrown in to lead into the other black tenace|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: i have to say, just leading from your longest suit against NT is a really good rule|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: there are 8 on top|pg||
nt|caitlin: ruffing clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flang: non 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good play in hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: Nice grand to play early in the morning.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|golfsquash: good defence not to ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: when people try something different, they sometimes score a spectacular goal, but most often it's an own goal|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|golfsquash: making now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||

nt|viren169: well done N/S|pg||

nt|daman: another big hand for East|pg||
nt|daman: what would we open?  1@H?   2@C?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well, the queen of spades' being onside was a tad lucky, but then we would call it cheap insurance|pg||
nt|chthonic: if it were offside|pg||
nt|baldjean: me neither|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going back to the bidding- Wests double of 1S merely says if you have a penalty double I am happy to defend- consequently it covers a multitude of hand types and is not necessarily ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strong-|pg||
nt|sga1: EW having a hard time here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: they say "ten tricks", might be I missed something in the play|pg||
mb|1C|nt|flang: les commentaires de JC Quantin n'avaient pas menti suspens jusqu'à la fin|pg||
nt|alpagavp: On gagne des SA en NS|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fascinating hand|pg||
nt|chthonic: so much distribution makes it a guess, methinks|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: extra points (as here) favour NT, but 2 majors with E/ another factor is whether the NT bid allows a 5 card major|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: the big bounce how|pg||
nt|chthonic: Borderline.  five losers is a lot for 2, but 5QT... 2C|pg||
nt|daman: right    I agree|pg||
nt|chthonic: QS useless, perhaps.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: as a friend said you can afford to open light when you play well:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6NT on a finesse here--will make if they bid it|pg||
nt|viren169: another slam!|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: 4 @S now will put them overboard|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D safer at imps?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|alpagavp: dans l autre salle ils jouent 1@d|pg||

nt|alpagavp: oui doivent|pg||
nt|alpagavp: oui je suis une patate|pg||
nt|alpagavp: et oui 240|pg||
nt|alpagavp: pour egaliser|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Very well played, just needed west to hold 4 or more clubs or 2 spades.|pg||
nt|chthonic: likely to pass out if not 2C, so 2C is my choice|pg||
nt|daman: me too|pg||
nt|chthonic: where do they get these hands?  Not a dull one in the bunch|pg||
nt|athene: so there is certainly ambiguity over whether double + 3@H = "i have a monster with long hearts" or just "i have long hearts and short diamonds, but was doubling in case you had a ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: No- 12 tricks in 6NT I think|pg||
nt|daman: luckily for them, they play a strong club system|pg||
nt|chthonic: Only problem with this hand is keeping out of slam.  But that should not be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: dealing computer had Weetabix for breakfast :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|daman: West will be putting the brakes on at every opportunity|pg||
nt|chthonic: No problems here.  Hearts under control after club is lost.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: lavinthal !|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yep a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: diamonds blocked as well if jack goes in|pg||
nt|chthonic: all the way to FIVE diamonds on last board at other table.|pg||
nt|chthonic: down one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: 3@D shows just @Ds?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that I can usually get that far with out resorting to a calculator these days|pg||
nt|chthonic: Is this akin to relay precision, where this auction shows a really, really bid hand?|pg||
nt|daman: Cooke has really got his Alert card working on this hand|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems to have some similarities|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a relay hand     a la Rubin-Becker fro the 80's|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Cooke's called director again ... but this time only for water|pg||
nt|daman: and late 70's|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: I want some too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: it's getting warm in here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: bidding tray still other side|pg||
nt|chthonic: I have the original five relay precision books - a treasure -- but the amount of effort for a partnership actually to play those methods is a monumental commitment|pg||
nt|daman: meckwell must be complicated as well|pg||
nt|chthonic: Heh|pg||
nt|chthonic: count signal?  Or attitude?|pg||
nt|daman: att|pg||
nt|daman: or count if udca|pg||
nt|viren169: good start... could break 4@H with the ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: need to get it just right|pg||
nt|athene: a difficult contract here for Gillis|pg||
nt|athene: the hands really don't fit well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - well, they do have he weaker pairs playing now :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmm|pg||
nt|viren169: South could always stop in 4N|pg||

nt|henryb: We are all confused because we sprang forward last night|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: not close?|pg||
nt|chthonic: A bit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: Might nick gthe over trick if he plays a spade to the K after taking the @D finesse twice|pg||
nt|daman: so much for system     missed a game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Probably more, but they are both major |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This won't take long, 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mwigor: having bid only 3@d in the other room (rather than 2@s) gillis felt obliged to compete to 4@d - assuming no defensive slips this will be 4 more IMPs to england|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, two schools of thought with Qxx(x) in dummy.  Wondered which it was.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: @d gone|pg||

pc|c6|nt|garnetts: He has |pg||
nt|chthonic: comes to same shift, either way|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chthonic: 2C - 2D (fewer than 2 controls) - 2H - 4H is my auction|pg||
