nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Bob Heitzman and Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi bob|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|idblu: hi all from chilly Toronto, Canada :)|pg||
nt|idblu: welcome back all :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|idblu: Tony, Mike, Al, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW for Scotland are Frazer Morgan and Phillip Morrison|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: both students at St Andrews university|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong NT from north|pg||
nt|cindy: very strong  meaty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS got too ambitious in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c-2n-3@c-p is a sensible auction assuming inverted|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might be the final contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E leads a D against 3NT -- the 8 or 9 for preference -- W will have to shift to a low spade right away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brrr|pg||
nt|mamos: South is not well placed when it comes to making an opening lead|pg||
nt|mamos: it would be great if someone could tell us the scores|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
mb|r|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: PB England 50 (2), Scotland 29 (2), Wales 26 (2) Northern Ireland 10 (1), ROI 0 (1)|pg||
nt|cindy: could be dont|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or i guess even the Q will do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too bad, cuter if low spade necessary|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit?|pg||
nt|mamos: Catherine (Evans) and Eve Hatfield are the WElsh North South|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good hand for west|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT BY E|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North for Scotland is Jun Nakamaru-Pinder|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: vugraph just catching up|pg||
nt|mamos: one trick gone after q@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the club suit may go jack, king, ace, queen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: SORRY FOLKS WILL CATCH UP NEXT E ROLLING IN TRICKS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Tom Paske and Graeme Robertson playing for England|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: 3NT+1|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Kath|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: well judged on the cards ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey folks|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS here are ladies|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike, Kath, Cliff, Fred and Tony|pg||
nt|mamos: this cant be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can only assume Frazer intends 2 hearts as forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi Mike Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Kath and Mike :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some scores here: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but not up to date |pg||
nt|mamos: NO:(|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: FYI, N-S are ladies, so please remember "she"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hurray|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North South are 2 ladies  hurray|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
nt|idblu: I think we probably will be in for some youthful exuberance...if I can go back to my own youthful bidding days :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: so these are the under 25s here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm more experienc might suggest to young Jones that on a weak hand with a six card spade suit, it is generally better to rebid the spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Scotland doing pretty well from the results i see, not sure how current|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Catherine and Eve|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: ah - or pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not for me if it was 4315 (@c6 is a heart)|pg||
nt|april7: NS play weak NT so DONT not possible|pg||
nt|daman: that too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: winning play by declarer after a good auction|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: or pass 1S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|cindy: can play for overtricks now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: anyway 2@H is going to survive with perhaps an imp to Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not @d10 in trick2?|pg||
nt|cindy: good question|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless E bid 1 spade on a get your retaliation in first principal, but this may be two high..|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idblu: ge Roland :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|capercliff: these ruffs actually help declarer in a way|pg||
nt|capercliff: but the A@h was an error|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so may get through|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cindy: four pitches will be painful for E|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole. Welcome to you|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: really?|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Helen|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||
nt|mamos: should probably make from here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idblu: home now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: 1NT seems normal though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: kind defence|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h4|nt|mamos: NS and West all female :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|april7: poor E|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: no wonder he passed, then|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|cindy: good enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also a small @h to @hK is better than @hJ|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|eggy: attempting to go down I think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|eggy: but gets away with it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: no play for it :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 6nt on N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes kath U25|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty tony, any results anywhere?|pg||
nt|idblu: do we know much about these players?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: o'rourke I guess is Irish :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: somewhere no doubt...think England may be ahead|pg||
nt|capercliff: S should be able to se that her A@h isnt going anywhere so no hurry to cash it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hello again all|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|chick: hello everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: srry conection problems :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're not wrong there|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 females at the table so Alex Morris will have his work cut out to keep out|pg||
nt|mamos: up|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: 3NT looks a more likely contract|pg||
nt|mamos: well England off to the fast start their previous record in the competition suggested they might|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: another partscore @S fpr EW and @H NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS?|pg||
nt|cindy: would be kind of pushy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other names dont sound Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what west wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 4@H  non vul :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i do too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but Northern Ireland played well last match for a good win|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 2 ladies NS in other room for N ireland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi mike|pg||
nt|idblu: hi mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: none of the other three are backward when it comes to bidding|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting jump shift in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 mikes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure of their ages, maybe girls?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when does a girl become a woman :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall !|pg||
nt|bobh1: set the auction up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is allowable at green but will not get a great result this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Here is Mike... he will know the scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Helen, could you please enter result on 13 manually?|pg||
nt|mamos: England are playing Wales in their final match but we don't know the relative scores of England Scotland and NI|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: well we arent results merchants, most of us like the bid|pg||
nt|mamos: another possible game swing here|pg||
nt|benjy: He recently got engaged so he should be able to maintain his concentration|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: here we'll probably see 4sf etc|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, sadly Scotland missing 3 games|pg||
nt|mamos: I think Mini Paske will bid it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: that's a racy double of  1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: England have bid 4@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh they play strong @c in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: whats the over/under   for undertricks?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a heart lead may cause problems, but North is unlikely to find it here after the 1@H opening |pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here with 13 is an aggressive calll|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like at least 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
nt|mamos: hi ben|pg||
nt|benjy: Any thoughts on the lead? You could easily argue for a trump lead (my choice), dummy could have a ruffing value|pg||
nt|mamos: racy I couldn't possibly comment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that we don't have an updated ranking, but England has won the Peggy Bayer (U20) by a large margin, and the English U25s are also in a strong position to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now where will Ms Nash look for tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a maker now........... lead of small @D might have worked if led|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
nt|cindy: 4 now|pg||
nt|idblu: inverted minors...2@C game forcing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, @SK |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: It's Norma!|pg||
nt|mamos: I guess it's Catherine and Eve EW for Wales|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: apparently 4n is RKC in @c's|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie in a friendly way so no probs|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep, would have been a lot in 6@c as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with clubs 3-2, this should be no problem|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will get the right player names eventually; pls be patient|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: a poor switch why on earth does he want to ruff when he has natural trump tricks?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S looked 100%|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -2 it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's enjoying himself|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: NS ontrack here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: five star contract!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: watching poor east suffer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: don't understand this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: ac is reasonable a dim is reasonable a spade to the K is reasoanble but why has he plasyed the 2c??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see an upside to this play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think David Franklin is our operator now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: even if East responded to B/Wood :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bidding diagram is missing a couple of passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Whoever it is will be quite pleased to have an easy contract to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Thanks Kerry says Boyd|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: 2 spades a bit pessimistic it seems from north this time|pg||
pc|hT|nt|capercliff: not that it is really biddable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no it didnt seem obvious|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats right Cliff, bid 'em up|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 opposite 12...need the hand records to bid 6 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: another profit for NS|pg||
nt|cindy: think so ?  partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Claim 12 tricks before anything happens!|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: 5sx escaped for 1 down and they defended 5C in open room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not important here, but as a metter of general tchnique you should aleays try to retain entries to both hands in trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: pitching @H now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: 2@s is too weak For me 3 possibilities. pass for penalty, 2nt or 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S does not open, N does not like his hand for game, especially with a lot wasted in hearts. maybe he would pass out the double at matchpoints, but even then EW are nonvul, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has a stiff stpade it could be ugly for NS (esp. if S has spade ace)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, north also had a option of playing in 2 hearts x |pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|mariner1: no @D?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: oh dear |pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: maybe 4 8s here|pg||
nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am told that England are 10 VPs ahead of NI in the Junior Camrose before the last round. England playing against Wales|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: S tries to go down|pg||
pc|c9|nt|capercliff: and the K@d is waste paper:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: East probably ought to have risked 2@s, but that's the kind of action that comes with experience|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to play it out, it is MANDATORY to discard the jack of diamonds on the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: she's going to be endplayed in a minute|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: no|pg||
nt|idblu: back to Watson...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, South probably ought not to have been playing like this, but...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: ..she survived, I guess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idblu: on  Play of The Hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: 10 tricks then|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|eggy: for the extra imp|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|nt|capercliff: nice squeeze|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|mc|10|nt|capercliff: :)|pg||

nt|mamos: NS found their good save here|pg||
nt|eggy: It seems that Jones & Bell had doubled 3D on hand 1|pg||
nt|eggy: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think experienced players would enter the auction as East David|pg||
nt|cindy: 2@hx would scare me at IMPs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an option, but perhaps not an attractive one facing heart shortness. he can't count on more than 100, and may not get that, so why not just take an easy plus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's not like S rates to have Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: find it surprising that 4n is both intended and interpreted as RKC but they landed on their feet for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let W think for a few seconds that E has the diamond ace. then cash it. life's little pleasures|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess it was undo|pg||
nt|idblu: what systems are these pairs playing?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Norma :)|pg||
nt|mamos: with the 2-2 break EW can get home in 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well, gird up the loins girls!|pg||
nt|mamos: Richard and Brian had a tough time in the last match against Wales so perhaps this start will make them feel better!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i dont know, are they on ecats?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Partner said D and not 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: NSmight fall off their horse in 4@Sx|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
nt|april7: 4th hand might balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pleased to here all of you defend Norths action at the table|pg||
nt|idblu: not strong NT n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might make a 3N here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe that's @H and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht cannot get to dummy to take the club finesse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: so he will be reduced to cashing the ace, with fortuitous results|pg||
nt|mamos: EW played 4@H in OR but North looks favourite to make 1NT  funny old game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, a passed hand should not reopen with D there without 4 spades|pg||
nt|idblu: it's been suggested that n/s are playing ACOL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a "do something sensible partner" double?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS don't appear to have a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Eng 127 - NI 117 - Scot 108 - Ire 87 - Wal 97|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing is the issue here to bring in the 9th trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont fancy it really|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: OR Scotland did get to game, but 4 hearts a difficult contract with handling problems|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will do OK on a club lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@DX prob their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s can be made double dummy - it can also easily be misdefended-a dim two ruffs and two hearts are easy for the defence but they will not necessarily also come tio a lub trick a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: club may go away on the third heart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant believe O'rourke is thinking |pg||
nt|capercliff: Phil and Frazer are a young Scottish pair, but have ben playing together for some years in fact|pg||
nt|benjy: e/w have a cheap save 500 if the defense take their ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: save would have been cheap|pg||
nt|mamos: or not:(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: 9 tricks look easy with the @D hook and a @H|pg||
nt|benjy: some might have overcalled 3@S with 64 shape at this vul|pg||
nt|chick: was it Larry Cohen who said, "I've spent my life bidding 4@S over 4@H" ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that solid 6-card @s suit 4@s is a master contract. Yes I see AKQJ10 as a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|mamos: West seems to have been a little passive here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: king is better|pg||
nt|mamos: still has seven tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps after some hearts west will allow a club finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps...... |pg||
nt|mamos: pick up diamonds?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but the defence may be difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: might as well keep on leading @s|pg||
nt|mamos: well bod|pg||
nt|mamos: bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear he should seriously downgrade his diamond holding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: O'Rourke overbid here|pg||
nt|mamos: well it was always a likely outcome|pg||
nt|idblu: this doesn't play well....but on values s/b in game |pg||
nt|mamos: I once asked Martin Jones about a 4@S bid by the late great John Collings over 4@H and Martin said John's philosophy was to bid 4@S and then look at his hand :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: low @c is clear now|pg||
nt|mamos: @cx |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and equally clear to go up|pg||
nt|bobh1: so maybe it's right to cash the A|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N will make on lie of the cards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and 3NT may be difficult to defeat|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't always work, of course|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: play for the max!|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 24 combined points but very flat hands ghame not at all attratcive|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems odd that the singleton bids clubs and the 7-card clb suit bids hearts - I guess that is the modern game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
nt|mamos: lol of course not but it's not always easy for the other side to know what to do|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
nt|chick: would be interesting to know the specific meanings of those bids |pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||
nt|april7: if short suit trial was possible in saystem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to eggy|pg||
nt|eggy: hI EVERYONE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actiually, couldn;t it be right to lead another heart? how does S know the diamonds are running? and N could have much better sopades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: Ruth could afford K@D first|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: now the defence have burnt a trick ltho conmtract still one off|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East realised he had 2 entries to set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I'm guessing 2@H is a 3-card limit raise, and 4@C a cue|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd guess 2@H was a 3 card raise to 2@S but don't really know|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Still, one feels West might chance a double|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: smal @H|pg||
nt|idblu: chance for many now|pg||
nt|mamos: unpleasant moment for South|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: north gave it back he should never cover the JH|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: at this vul 7@S is unlikely to be worse than a few imps away defending 7@H risks a bucketfu|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: l|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to play big @D 1st|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bad news now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: more imps to England, but really this should have made|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: yawn|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Unfortunately fighting with connection probs in Belfast|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mamos: 24 points seems the norm for bidding games at imps these days|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cindy: except N could have knocked out club K and take @h finesse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could we please have the correct player names up?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We still have English and Northern Irish from the previous match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Peggy Bayer: ENG 175 (maximum!) - SCOT 143 - WAL 102 - NI 49 - IRE 44|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: I got nothing (as they say)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: claim|pg||

nt|eggy: well at least this way you made EW guess if they could make 7|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out   this might be exciting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid at these colors facing a 3rd seat opener seems overly ambitious. unless there is something about the 1C opener i am not aware of |pg||

nt|yo_yo: Kerri, i beg her pardon :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: I don't like double|pg||
nt|eggy: what was it Mike?|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward, this|pg||
nt|bobh1: was tough to avoid 6@c in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H doesnt feel like enough to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: here they are exerting less pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: Dbl   hehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quite a bit of difference between teenagers and 24 year olds|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should bid 4H in my uiew|pg||
nt|mamos: I know what do you do with a good Diamond hand .... etc|pg||
nt|chick: you think they are playing transfer advances?|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure |pg||
nt|mamos: what will South make of this?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting problem for South. Anyone expecting a discplined Pass from our Junior?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lestergold: 8 card suit is not a takeout double|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll have to bid at 5 level soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he must think X and then bid @H is better to describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: EW need to be careful to check winners as well as losers here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jones like to open 1C. or else he has a defective bidding box|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry   im a @d bidder with E hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South does not have a clear action|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s can make but to bid it is another story|pg||
nt|mamos: not easy for South|pg||
nt|mamos: had better pass :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: maybe it could, but it would seem normal to arrive in only 3@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be 6 spades is on though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he isv ulnerable he needs a goodish hand to overcall 4h itys not too good for that bid|pg||
nt|chick: double for the spades, then correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: pass on s???|pg||
nt|mamos: NS played in their 3-0 fit after West had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why didn´t S bid 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: they don't play drury for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: still will be hard to stay out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knows he has to bid @H at the  5 level eventually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see the point of 1@S |pg||
nt|benjy: 1@S is madness|pg||
nt|chick: not do I|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have a perfectly respectable club suit|pg||
nt|mamos: surely going to land her in 4@S|pg||
nt|benjy: you have a 5 card suit and you want partner to lead a @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
nt|april7: EW should stay in a decent @D partscore and NS should stay out of bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. can;t imagine passing|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm sure that's his intent, but this is the wrong type of hand for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they wwere always bidding at least 4s in any case|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has shown his partner a good hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually not good as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom and Dom are more coservative than most juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: conservative|pg||

nt|bobh1: blakwood not that helpful|pg||
nt|mamos: Blackwood with xx ???|pg||
nt|cindy: thats not a surprise is it ?|pg||

nt|april7: W now 3@D and thats it|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|daman: he will bid 3@S|pg||

nt|ralfwil: old fashioned Culbertson asking bid! |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in @H not good|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5h doubled only 2 off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: Im for 6 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that lead 6s made|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
nt|dburn: double may have been more major-suit oriented - 2@c would not be such a good idea if North were 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|daman: passing is not an option|pg||
nt|april7: or even worse|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i could show both suits by specifying them right away, i might--certainly if NV i would. here i like  1D|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservative  new bridge adjective|pg||
nt|benjy: if fiona was my partner i would call the director and have the psyche recorded in an attempt to stop her from doing it in the future|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a make :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobh1: well done whatever it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, spades are 3-3 and the queen is onside|pg||
nt|chick: not a bad agreement to have|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: more optimistic than that George :)|pg||
nt|cindy: it does make 4S i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I don´t expect 3@cD be the final contract, I must bid 3@h on S|pg||
nt|cindy: and 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does it mean when you can't act over 1C, but you can act over a jump-rebid facing a passed partner when opps are unlimited but also have not shown a fit?|pg||
nt|mamos: my typoingis carp|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: what would you have him do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or well-guessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E cannot afford to double|pg||
nt|cindy: a guess i think|pg||
nt|dburn: bid 4@s, perhaps?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes on any lead perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade lead?|pg||
nt|idblu: also|pg||

nt|idblu: @D on @C and ruff 3 @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well may need a diamond hook|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in a good spot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eggy: still 1 back to Ireland it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: 11|pg||
nt|dburn: as well he might have been|pg||

pc|s4|nt|daman: trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has a 10 count, why should he cue bid|pg||

nt|daman: Smolski still bids like that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm sure I was worse but this is really just out of control|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be asking about @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: and @CKQ not looking good opposite splinter|pg||

nt|mamos: not sure Or score is correct  I thought it was 2@Dx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H was an interesting choice - certainly might have tried 2@D first |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Scotland seem to have judged well to bid 3 hearts here|pg||
nt|benjy: she can't play trumps now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CA, @H ruff, @CK for @H discard, @S|pg||
nt|benjy: but will get home if she leads diamonds from the top|pg||

nt|vugraphzjj: Thinking cap on|pg||

pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: i don't think that is clear. just because S didnt make a neg double doesnt mean he cant have 4 spades|pg||
nt|capercliff: to play a @h again|pg||

nt|mamos: neither pair seemed to get to grips with their values on Board 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This was a typical hand where you must act early. otherwise you are out-bidden|pg||
nt|cindy: first few hands have been interesting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S on that last hand, it would be useful to play that D by N shows three good hearts. since N did not rebid 1S and has a jump-rebiddablke suit in a good offensive hand on this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction, not a great idea to play it for penalty|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  thats true too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 4S should either be natural or a cue, by agreement|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know what it's called in English either|pg||
nt|idblu: we are all resulting here...in real life how many pairs would really get to 6 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens KQ clubs is enuf to ensure 6s cold with dim k onside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one, looking at xxx in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not a good slam really|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean hardly a biddable slam|pg||
nt|mamos: probably imps to England because contract was 2@D doubled in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Helen|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok so a semi-nice 3 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice 3 I think :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: 4@S normal here but unlucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still doesn't excuse the 1@S bid, imho |pg||
nt|mamos: I think many people think Fiona has a great future in the Women's game|pg||
nt|mamos: well in the game full stop|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: did E really made it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but perhaps also a win. 4@s is laydown|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H shows a desire to get the opponents into a thin game while telling them how to make it|pg||
nt|idblu: agree|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise for south|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumably 2h some sort of weak 2 suiter?|pg||
nt|lestergold: souith seriously fixed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H? Gosh|pg||
nt|chick: why not a great future in ALL games?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|idblu: double would work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Agree Marshall. 4@s must be a cue with @d support|pg||
nt|mamos: i got there first|pg||
nt|chick: lol  yes, you did :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: e/w will find their @D now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neither can bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but what will n/s who have the balance of points fiind?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: looks a good wjo to me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not an overcall that you would want to show the children|pg||
nt|mamos: getting old Mike ?:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: missed a pass operator|pg||
nt|petergill: A Pass By North is missing|pg||
nt|dburn: rubbish|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i dont know what I would have bid as South|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Very difficult after that bidding by EW|pg||
nt|idblu: fixed|pg||
nt|idblu: by system|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I would have overcalled in NT... but maybe thats not a success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's amazing what a few -800's do for you|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: Philip? East 2@C?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that opener but it worked for N ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: south can bid 3h over 3d which should be to play in hearts|pg||
nt|idblu: now we're stretching|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a bit high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NI stopped in 2NT on  3 - 11 to England|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: talking of thin games...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a bit too many... sac against 2 spades EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North was just competing but South thought invitational maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That looks a brave raise opposite 15-17, so maybe they play a wider range|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Each side had now propelled itself to a higher level than they needed to be at.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Makes it a tough game!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thing beginning to happen now re player names|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have them all - thanks operator|pg||
nt|mamos: game had play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H should come in and possibly 4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: what would North do with a 5=1=1=6 shape?|pg||
nt|benjy: 3NT is the practical bid on values but i would be worried about not showing my @C, with only Axx in @S it is not clear that 3NT is the correct spot|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|daman: hard to believe that NS, looking at dummy, couldn't understand how important it was to play trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have leant on 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: I might have unsheathed the red card|pg||
nt|april7: X???|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever partner's 2NT meant I seem to have some good defensive cards|pg||
nt|daman: yes   double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E must falsecard with a top heart|pg||
nt|idblu: N didn't have any tries, other than double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: But south had already bid her hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do  we know what NT they play at this vul?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobh1: according to steve robinson, open 1@s|pg||
nt|dburn: Nothing "must" be a cue bid if it can be natural|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: I have 4 tricks in my hand and my partner has competed red to the 3 level???  I whack 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: 3 dpwn and no X?!|pg||
nt|bobh1: but most others would often open 1@c depending on suit quality|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done by North to drop the @C109|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: it is a matter of agreements, david. you can go either way on the agreement, depending on what you think will be most useful to the partnership. i don;t care either way here, but i ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will observe that 5116 doesnt get dealth all that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: 1 off at best, beatig 140 I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we ladies get nervous about doubling|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos: The poor defence to 5@D and a doomed 3NT in the open reverses the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: well declarer ok now if picks up Clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 8 tricks now unless she takes a first round club finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: with the young players, you have to expect the unexpected|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||
nt|eggy: maybe an imp here at most|pg||
nt|idblu: asking for @C...|pg||
nt|mamos: East needs to play @d|pg||
nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly if 2@H is NF and West can pass 3@C  |pg||
nt|benjy: i very much doubt that|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer could easily play a @S to the Q here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idblu: I have a secret to tell you...so do we men :)|pg||
nt|idblu: or is that wee men|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec points out that 3N NS has play, but the spade bids did for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes they did  that's result merchanting|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like the somnambulist coup |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|daman: in 20 years we will forget all of this|pg||
nt|mamos: should be ok which ever way she plays|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: break in the excitement- time for a little refreshment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good diamond|pg||
nt|mamos: well done ben|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy: and now it looks like she is down on a @S return as long as the defense are careful|pg||
nt|benjy: a @H return would do as well|pg||
nt|chick: true, but not as clear ... her pard bid spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Fiona thinking long and hard!|pg||
nt|benjy: i cannot think of a case where a @S return is not correct. But it is always best to check!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Richard Boyd - Brian Sharkey  vs  Catherine Evans - Eve Hatfield|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mamos: These are two relatively small countries with only a few young players |pg||
nt|daman: amazing|pg||
nt|april7: but we all learn from our mistakes hopefully|pg||
nt|daman: ducking the @C was weak|pg||
nt|idblu: @D Q will still score|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: still 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: would seem to be more useful as a cuebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats stops the endplay|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eggy: although perhaps not enough entries for all teh ruffs now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 1 results: JC Wales-Scotland 14-16; England -Ireland 16-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade very unattractive play contract shouldstill go off |pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: well bidding and making 4 hearts is quite a coup on this lot|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: if S played the @H King at trick 1, North would not have ducked the @C  I'm sure|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing neither way, as some poet remarked|pg||
nt|mamos: Ian Jones enjoying himself here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|idblu: can't help but go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should of course play club and leave declarer tio do his own swork|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not opeing !NT on that South hand unless it shows 18 points|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: one more board at this table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N had to win on the hand!|pg||
nt|mamos: he was :(    hush my mouth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too much elation about the king of hearts falling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good comment received about 3@H. Bit of a methods tester - is double take-out or penalties, and is a bid of 3@S forcing or not?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: in fact she makes 9 by ducking a spade|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i agree that if you do NOT have a clear agreement, the old default principle is best: "if it COULD be natural, we shouyld both assume it is natural"|pg||
nt|mamos: Is "rubbish" Parliamentary language?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the house of commons|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eggy: Good morning everyone|pg||
pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: looks like no swing|pg||
nt|oliverc: I have to go. Bye all|pg||
nt|mamos: thank you Oliver|pg||
nt|daman: the bland leading the bland|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: notice played the slam hand in 6Hx OR|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: I always think we should have a joker "Could I try that trick again" we all have that sinking feeling when we've done something silly  :(  it's tough when you are being watched|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so E will not be punished for failure to play 9 or 10 of hearts on first round (though that might not work anyway--still it is important to make those plays just to keep in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: practice)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Steve, welcome|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|cindy: sorry   computer kicked me off|pg||
nt|mamos: This is typical Junior Camrose stuff loads of opportunities for plus swings which elusively turn into minuses|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: England take the lead with 5 hearts +1 board 4 OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, once W follows to the second club, overtaking with either the ten or Q is 100%. undoubtedly N thought a singleton club was unlikely for several reasons, but when you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have a 100% line...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cindy|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not for scotland|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks above all o helen our operator|pg||
nt|idblu: liked the @DK :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|mamos: some one has cranked up the deal generator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another slam to bite the dust here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 and 8 card suits growing ion trees around here|pg||
nt|idblu: still learning that you can't preempt twice with the same hand|pg||
nt|idblu: no double...no trouble|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so good defence for -3|pg||
nt|capercliff: here's a bit of action|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes East has done well here... the 3heart bid and the diamond switch....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...just the sort of things to put pressure on the oppo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think South showed her hand there |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@H didnt show her strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: thx to spectators|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks especially to Philkip our operator, thanks to NIBU and Sandy Millership (I know how nerve wracking it is to run one of these things)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? Well, I suppose they had more trumps than their opponents, but even so...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
nt|idblu: @H suits abound in this event it appears|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so North couldnt judge to go on |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or not|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: yes, that is likely to haunt him for a while|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: playing @c before trumps had solved everything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if n/s have heqard of blackwood they may stay out of slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am confident they will|pg||
nt|lestergold: confident they wikll stay ouit?|pg||
nt|benjy: i think most juniors would open the east hand at this vul|pg||
nt|mamos: Roland's favourite 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|1S|an|3-!S, 3-!H|nt|yo_yo: yes stay out|pg||
nt|benjy: 4@H was a transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO and Roland for organising us all and thanks to you for watching |pg||
nt|april7: not easy to reach but we will see|pg||
nt|eggy: tricky bod for East though|pg||
nt|eggy: bid|pg||
nt|april7: this bid makes it possible|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D seems automatic|pg||
nt|eggy: not likely to get to 6C, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: he might barely have bid 2@d, which would not have been especially tricky|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is for the club allstars|pg||
nt|april7: W must be careful not to go to 6NT|pg||
nt|mamos: and to marshall and cindy and Bob and David and ralf for their commebts|pg||
nt|idblu: is this a KO event, swiss ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you i dont like that 2@C bid|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy not much help this loks likely to fail|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Kelsey once said - avoid Axxx against no-tump. Right here, diamonds works better|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a good hand yet has losers so no game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: still, his actual effort might work pretty well|pg||
nt|mamos: a tricky hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|eggy: Well tricky to get over the hand I meant :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes ralf in 3@H in the OR declarer did test Clubs|pg||
nt|idblu: round robin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a round robin|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north must be chaffing at the bit with that monster |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2@D bid might excite O'Rourke|pg||
nt|mariner1: S not counting her losers enough|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eggy: unlikely that NS will bid this 10%- game, so a narrow win for England|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there you go|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have bid a lot of clubs even at this vulnerability with good 8 card suits you at least must take up the oppos bidding space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Somerville stayed strangely silent on this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is not a bad spot, but can go down on a @d ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: well 2@S works|pg||
nt|mamos: worked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is this a steal by EW?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - nothing much of anything makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is Ruth showing the minors ?  It doesnt look strong enough for aces|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: next session in twenty minutes or so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will east balance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensibly not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to the operator for showing us all four hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|idblu: and such a strong playing hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha enter dopi and ropi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or podi and pori|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if they know their ropis/dopis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cue for all round disaster|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt sure which suit North is interested in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well obviously dont play rkc |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North cant really bid again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neither can South|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eggy: remarkable as David Coleman would have said :)|pg||
nt|april7: this time not a wrong prediction by me|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since West has shown already that she is not backward in coming forward|pg||
nt|april7: with @S fonesse even 6 NT, I miscounted before|pg||
nt|dburn: be honest now - how many of you lot could get to 6@c in four bids?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may have competed with 3 spades here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually correct technique on 2-suiters where there is work to be done to attend to the side suit before trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think this will make|pg||
nt|mamos: and apologies for my typing   thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for making us welcome and BBO for bringing this broadcast to us all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can North find the @DK lead?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but the lead..|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: pass is 1|pg||
nt|idblu: everybody has it marked on their card...but when it comes up :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south hasnt a clue |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks ok, Mike|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe but not far from 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Thats the trouble with that 2@C bid, usually agrees @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: only the youth|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if W holds off till 3rd trump play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: results will be posted here http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|idblu: or is P 1st step|pg||
nt|eggy: Still looks a trick short|pg||
nt|mamos: NS may be a little over excited at the thought of a big win and an englisg disaster but they wont get them like this|pg||
nt|mariner1: a little too much aggression here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has the dreaded multi found more victims|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: pass shows 1 inexperience playing in our 4/4 fit when you have a solid 7 card suit elsewhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now to negotiate the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right contract it seems as 5 hearts is off on the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: amd 5d off if they find the ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H goes down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 5h unlucky does go ionm the ruff andf5f makes but normally this should be plaed in hearts if we are not result merchants|pg||
nt|idblu: and of course we are not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you eating your words there Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Norths 2C bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|lestergold: eating which words|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think maybe both 5d and 5h are both going down|pg||
nt|idblu: ty Helen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: So there may be an adjustment as they were told it ws nat|pg||

nt|chick: tough bid for S, if pard has clubs is a big hand, if not he has 3 tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: may end up in 3NT here, though|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: and that won't play terribly well either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get to 5@C with accuracy?|pg||
nt|dburn: good decision by West not to raise the pre-empt with 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David must have the recipe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that even 5@C won't make on a spade lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So how do you stay out of game?|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all obvious to get to 5@c - I confess, I would have bid the same way as North-South here|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing very much|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Not unblocking is silly at best, even if east retains an entry here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: they did indeed block the spades, but they can survive that with East having @dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer could have knocked out @DA and make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No they can't|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had to knock out East's entry, not West's|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: sure they can - East wins the third round of diamonds, on which West pitches @sK|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not play a 3rd round of diamonds!|pg||

nt|mamos: There is some merit in just bidding slams like that at least you don't look a fool when you miscount the Aces after b/wood|pg||
nt|cindy: ty roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a sensible ruling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope Adams wasnt put off with the director called|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S 1@C 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: will NS bid 4@S|pg||
nt|eggy: I think South did well to throw a spade in a way, as declarer might have read the suit otherwise|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps a slightly more straightforward board|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here though someone could be shoved up into one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: 4@H and 5@D with @H finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: I WAS TOO INTERESTED IN SCORES STOPPED WATCHING :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|mamos: There are two competitions this is U25 - Junior Camrose and the Peggy Bayer U20|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps West should have played the hearts from dummy anyway as if N ducked the HA, it wouldn;t have helped|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N decides to scrpe a bid yes|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd bid 2@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: scrape*|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The play ended, not sure what happened|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: and 3NT with no finesses at all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: awkward bid now for Sharkey|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|mamos: let's hope EW get in the bidding|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eggy: but with clubs 2-2, there were enough entries to not need the spade finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all ty Helen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi again Cindy|pg||
nt|mamos: not not not 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: appears to have claimed one off when she could have made :(|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps misguessed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Peggy B - Eng 175, Scot 118, Wales 83, Nor Irl 45 and Irel 33|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I doubt that - I think the opreator dropped behind the play, it happenes to the best of us|pg||
nt|mamos: even you LIz  ?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but now it can be difficult to find|pg||
nt|april7: good lead but W has a chnace for 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|capercliff: a NT never came to mind|pg||
nt|mamos: scrpe was better|pg||
nt|eggy: a splinter now should dampen any possible enthusiasm|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C would be my choice |pg||
mb|4H|nt|oliverc: 4@H a mile off anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: aggressive start by NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion E is too passive afre 1@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hardly a mile - but 4H is 1 down|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi mike, ralf|pg||
nt|mamos: calmer hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well o'rourke and Adams should brush up on Unassuming cue bids before the next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play 2/1 maybe that's their system|pg||
nt|capercliff: intended as forcing I gather|pg||
nt|mamos: but then 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Q for a make it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be slightly nervous playing 3NT on this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CQ would be a good lead here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet North finds it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I cannot tell a lie.... even me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: but an interesting choice to not correct to 4@s holding a singelton|pg||
nt|eggy: that even more so :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: YES!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: what a player|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S pretty conservative partner did not have to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: cunning lead|pg||
nt|eggy: Tom Paske is a tricky player, as you can see from the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: S's 1@D a warning here.......|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm pretty sure I'd end in the losing 4@S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes with the 3@C call it would be hard to avoid now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I would have done the inviting with the East hand, not the West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both boys hoping the other has shortage in @C|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike Amos is our table host and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|idblu: will ease the jitters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West: "What are your leads?" South: "Bl**dy good ones"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this one will play itself- k hearts coming down in 2 wont hurt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: run the spade Q for 12|pg||
nt|mamos: even with only 23 points 3NT wasn't a million miles away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: I confess to not having worked it all out but it appears natural to win @d in dummy and play Club|pg||
nt|mamos: a pretty quick one off I'd suggest|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth Connolly will be happy in a minute|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|idblu: I would think 4@S the %age bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed, are they playing 5 majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and even the Q @S is not co-operating|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idblu: everyone here would|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: i agree - 3h on second round then smack them if they try 3 spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oliverc: E/W should certainly be competing as far as the 3-level|pg||
nt|mamos: all these four players are expeienced Junior Camrose players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in a way, South was fortunate that the @D10 was not from @DKQJ10|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can certainly be made double dummy, but you cannot blame West after opening on this tripe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit unfortunate for the Irish boys|pg||

nt|mariner1: - Tournament site|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 50 minutes: Northern Ireland v England|pg||
nt|capercliff: I suppose they would have to be if playing a forcing NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not easy to defend, but this may let it thro'|pg||
nt|yo_yo: spade finesse for 9 now, run 10@S|pg||
nt|mamos: and partner has so clearly limited her hand - sensible bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i wonder why Fred!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are the scores still not updated?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|idblu: because we can see that works :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he cant read the cards as well as we can|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|chick: my partner would answer that question "Wall Street leads"|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: that looks a little over confident|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's on the right track|pg||
nt|chick: "standard and poor"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: now that is a curious line|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy would be a disappointment if @SA was in South|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the Camrose Trophy, Lady Milne (women), Junior Camrose (U25) and Peggy Bayer (U20), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland play as separate entities, unlike other ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: international competitions where the Irish Bridge Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|othered1: That's nice double dummy, but why should south have played that way?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But David claimed he would have beaten it|pg||

mb|1C|nt|odysseus69: spades and minor- popular treatment |pg||
nt|mamos: wow 3@h there is brave|pg||
nt|oliverc: That should raise some interest from East :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H overcall for very very very young|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fear :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is probably thinking about his methods here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: south hand very suitable for attempted suicide-|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Steve Eginton|pg||
nt|eggy: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: hi eggy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would expect more for a 3@H overcall. What about you, guys?|pg||
nt|eggy: I seemed to have arrived at a "sprightly" overcall|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is penalty so choice is double -only 300- 3NT or 4S- |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would never consider 3H even when I was young|pg||
nt|mamos: East West bid  quite soundly so East will expect a fair hand opposite I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- 500 for 3Hx - the preferred option|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: If West is showing a probable 5-5 with a Minor, East must surely be interested in a|pg||
nt|oliverc: Minor suit slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4@c is forcing, so that´s my bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that score card doesnt look too healthy for NI|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: slam needs too much|pg||
nt|mamos: even my generous spirit can resist suggesting that declarer's line was poor there -- no clear plan |pg||

nt|mamos: INT |pg||

mb|3N|nt|dburn: whenever the English were getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the Question|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Both West s passed|pg||
nt|idblu: easier to show later|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy: think my chimp has some left over|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: no need when pard overcalls in spades|pg||
nt|idblu: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor will e/w be finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a theory that you should bid 1NT on the East hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6c or dim looks lioke a good save|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer did not have enough entries to finesse @s and @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 17 they did open the chunky 17 in 1N and are playing it there in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: will make 2 and lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think we've seen this 2@H bid before today 3 card Spade support or perhaps some other types|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah is that what it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: 1066 and all that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely you jusy have to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep perhaps 6 clubs x|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H might not persuade partner top move|pg||
nt|mamos: to move|pg||
nt|eggy: has another chance though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult to get to 4 hearts though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so is double|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oliverc: sensible stuff|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is ok--maybe pd won't bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh I dont like double|pg||
nt|lestergold: west aint standing it|pg||
nt|idblu: W can't sit|pg||
nt|idblu: N can pass this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: Hastings Pudding|pg||
nt|april7: thats straight forward bidding|pg||
nt|bobh1: if (s)he does, maybe it'll be okay|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats it Cliff (last hand)|pg||
nt|eggy: We that should get some sort of response I think|pg||
nt|mamos: hmmm   |pg||
pc|s7|nt|idblu: he did :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he did thats sheer inxperience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to overrule partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky this isnt a make really|pg||
nt|mamos: surely will bid now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a cheap save|pg||
nt|idblu: nice support N bought :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: NS are female Kerri North Ruth South|pg||
nt|mamos: gosh wrong again|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Goodness me - I would bid like this without @CA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: can the defence prevail?  |pg||
nt|mamos: fast forward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some may wonder why N didn't bid 2C. but if NS style is regularly to make less-than-fully-prepared TO doubles, N cannot count on a fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure why east was so keen to defend either|pg||
nt|idblu: nice stop|pg||
nt|chick: W's spade bid gives the @SQ full value, plus diamond fit and A in the last suit|pg||
nt|chick: E was far too timid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well a good spot for the boys|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: @cJ from W had been bingo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer 3@H there, 4@H sounds like a splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|idblu: thats what N thought|pg||
nt|mdgraham: west will be miffed to see @S10xxx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pretty well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 4th best would probably have worked :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Routinely, you play low from dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: yes but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 ducks in @c a @h shift is needed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but not enough as declarer can duck twice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Will Ruth signal her A@D ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idblu: can make 6 with the @D hook\|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And there is a large bonus for bidding and making vulnerable games|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: yes - but if you lead 4th declarer has A10 doubleton|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: good save though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: i think it is asking too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for a club lead on this auction holding such poor spades and a club sequence. but either could be the winner. |pg||
nt|mamos: good effort...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idblu: but thats double dummy|pg||
nt|chick: looks to me like NS have only a partial in spades, so down 2 or 3 is a poor result for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: on the 6@C hand NS are in 3N in Open|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: better take the @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant see 6....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: sure he could have got an extra 200 a level higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: how doeshe know whether to play heart or spade now?|pg||
nt|idblu: u get 3 @H pitches|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: timing must be just right for that I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 110 or 140|pg||
nt|chick: vs a likely 300 now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|mamos: now is the crucial..|pg||
nt|idblu: he doesn't|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lost a trickl|pg||
nt|lestergold: expensive |pg||
nt|idblu: E fault for not cashing|pg||
nt|capercliff: always a @h and a @s to lose no?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so|pg||
nt|eggy: now should switch to hearts I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N also does not compute so -200 might score|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: more bloodletting since 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: moment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well nearly there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could W not switch to hearts? he can count a set if E has D king|pg||
nt|mamos: lots and lots off|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|idblu: i thot E had 3 @S's my error|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6 would be much closer if S did indeed have a splinter:)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: 5 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: actually 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||
nt|mamos: Kelsey wrote about 40 good books ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and several great ones|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy for south|pg||
nt|mdgraham: discard diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: but not easy for east because east doesnt know of double fit and doesnt know that 2 hearts arent cashing if played thru|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose East doesnt take West for tricks, with his preemptive 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our first match after the lunch break will be Northern Ireland vs England (Junior Camrose)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: signalling test - remember East opened 1@C|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but could see the @H going away|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: close match now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: but England will get an imp (assuming East plays a club)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: it is, but it's not easy to say which of North and South should have bid more|pg||
nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and going wrong now|pg||

nt|athene: well north, with an ace in his hand, knows a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|athene: since east is making grand slam tries|pg||

nt|athene: and double|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: But isn't it normal to bid 5@S after the 0 or 3 response? Partner passes with 0 and raises with 3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: adventures in card play (with Geza Ottlik) and Bridge for the Connoisseur come immediately to mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 7 passed out both rooms... good to see such sound bidding|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But there is one more opportunity for the Scots to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 25-3 now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: having thrown a club, he must play to set up a long heart|pg||
nt|mamos: Where Catherine and Eve beat 3@H on Board 16 (and could have made anextra trick with a trump promotion)Irish EW let 4@H make in OR |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well defended NI|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops it looks like they blocked the @S suit in Open on the 6@C/3N hand|pg||

nt|mamos: EW have a huge major fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: majors for sure|pg||
nt|mamos: and Ns minors of course|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1C promise clubs- do we know?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in majors against 5@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as used in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer unblocked|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: and a free @S bid by S|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks easy enough here|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case surely a massive jumop inm hearts would show thenature of west'shand even withour specific jump fit agreement|pg||
nt|mamos: They hadnt but they weren't lead at Trick 1 and were on view in dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they can get around that with @D though|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I don't know but I think it's likely|pg||
nt|daman: Wales just gained an impossible 13 IMPs to make the match closer|pg||
nt|mamos: ewww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how can it be "sound" when all pass. that is silence, not sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Marylin  Monroe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not from me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suit too bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on 19 E for Wales passed pout 1 spade for a swing|pg||

mb|2H|nt|april7: also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: steady..|pg||

nt|mamos: can't call that timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@h is better than 5@s!|pg||
nt|mamos: South will surely do something but surprised N did not double|pg||
nt|capercliff: im a @s bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Yes Kelsey is one of my favourites. all his analyzes are perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ur too young to know it was a term for shapely hands uised in the fifties for some reason|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur too innocent to be told |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a club lead beats 3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eggy: North's pass should not be forcing at this vul and this type of auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about "more or less". i specifically agree with the "less" part. yes i would pass|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks a usual contract and 4th highest seems to beat it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: and North presumably thinks so too, or he would have doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades -2 looks to give EW a chance here|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S too rich for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5 part scores in a row for EW - must be quite rare in a Junior event|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: less than automatic for me|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit odd, obviously not GF because they arent in game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is there 6@D coming?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|mamos: NS look like +500 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h shift will make -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 200|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h shift is also safe with @s K102.|pg||
nt|eggy: e|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right - as long as North still has lead|pg||
nt|eggy: But S may overtake and cash the diamond|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Right, but in my opinion N has to decide the defence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can tell N to shift to D with his signals but its only a recommendation|pg||
nt|mamos: undo Helen|pg||

nt|chick: maybe, W has no defense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: I have also met him at the table. He was always correct|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: tricky contract for south|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy: looks like an overtrick here   next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the bad slit may be a problem here|pg||
nt|capercliff: well, its not GF apparently|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S looks normal|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@S passed out would be OK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: another singleton Ace lead |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly indeed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: agree about 2S. this is a defensively oriented hand except for the sixth vclub, which has already been shown|pg||
nt|chick: its a good save, 5@H is makeable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values in the black suits, and partner may have nuisance values in trumps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 1@d as S, not 1@s on that "poor" suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: I think West is lucky that 5@H is making|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another suit pref signal too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|capercliff: noone lets you play at the 1 level these days Fred|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The English players are more experienced and it shows. For example, E-W in the open room are 13 and 16 years old respectively. Ralph Wiseman 12, Yonne (his sister) 16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ralph 13 that is|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cindy: i agree with 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has to be bid but it isnt all chopped liver|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...for this looks to make|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: probably you play these well, Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: no i dont|pg||
nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NI back in the lead after 5d -1 OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||
nt|cindy: its not N|pg||
nt|cindy: lol marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure if you bid 1@D you let West bid 1@h|pg||
nt|cindy: if S is interested in hearing from N again, he will balance|pg||
nt|idblu: I know that...I live in the 60"s|pg||

nt|chick: with N's double, he may get the @Ds wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: the thing is, by bidding 4@D then 5@D, you have forced NS to guess at the 5-level - why assume that they have guessed correctly? |pg||

nt|yo_yo: what's wrong with the old blood!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie nicely here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this should make not equiring rosenberg /zia declafrer play skill|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@C stayman?|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps Scotland can get a consolation imp here? It would be worth a VP too|pg||
nt|eggy: It's possible, but hard on that lead I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: agree bob|pg||
nt|cindy: its beyond maximum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor West has nowhere to go for tricks here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then one might expect South to pass 2@H.|pg||
nt|mamos: I know slightly odd but a safe enough outcome|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose bidding again keeps EW out of spades, but they would probably have bid them by now if they were ver going to|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case it was normal - no harm in being maximum once in a while|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even +2 possible it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: costly spot lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is tight|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt pretty probably encourage East to do it again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: up the anti,,, good defence required|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever it is it looks spectacularly unsound but fun to me :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idblu: wish trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|capercliff: always going off I suppose|pg||
nt|chick: yep, and everything is offside|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: the average age (I would guess) is less than 20 - it is sad to see them denigrated by'world class' players|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @d now I predict|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idblu: 2345|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make 6 needs to finesse club and establish 4th club|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|idblu: another wasted spot card|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: this can be tricky|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: don't agree with that - @H7, surely |pg||
nt|mamos: I want to bid at the Two Level with no long suit and 11 points ??  I don't think so|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont forget Mike, they are young and fearless |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: how many of you had a @s lead from S instead of @dK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: and looks like he can do taht|pg||
nt|idblu: down 1 probably best she can do|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: working play in trumps from Tom|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H going off in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead i suppose?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any lead could be right on this hand, even a trump! but i would lead diamond king|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that's why - South will assume that North had a singleton heart|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on the replayed line spade Jack would have made|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|mariner1: especially VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|mamos: some one should teach them fear lol|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|april7: E has only 4 losers in @D contract, but might lose control on @S leads, but N might have bid on to 3@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pd might have a stiff spade. but even a ruff there mnight not help us, and anyone pd might have a doubleton diamond and get a ruff there just as easily|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW are guys aren't they?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes bring  back National Service|pg||

nt|mamos: lol  good argument would tou open 1NT 15-17?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Even if 1nt is weak, wests hand is worth a rise to 3@s.  With 4-4 in majors I had asked for majors and after 2@d, my bid is 2@s, as an invitation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board and 15-15|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match tonight in about 20 mins: JC  Scotland v Wales|pg||

mb|p|nt|idblu: OR is finished|pg||
nt|chick: 2N wasn't a terrible bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very interesting though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I mean 6-4 in majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry two to go|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H partial plays well here|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: agreed|pg||

nt|mamos: +3???   surely not|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, how did he not lose the @CQ and a spade at the end?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: for me E has an opening with 4-4 in majors and 12 P|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H  didn't go off   oh dear oh dear|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: ah we missed board 10|pg||
nt|april7: cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that NI must be about the most experienced team this year Mike|pg||
nt|daman: should just jump to game now|pg||
nt|daman: signing off|pg||
nt|mamos: ten i think|pg||
nt|chick: long weekend for the operators too :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 10 looks a more likely number|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: then E might continue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with Easts 2 spade bid, its difficult for the west hand to stop|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t see why W would nopt bid stayman no matter what their range is|pg||
nt|cindy: i know|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe not sure of their methods|pg||
nt|cindy: this could get doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some results on :http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if NS were vul this would get doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: N should double in my opinion|pg||
nt|cindy: heart A wont be good lead|pg||
nt|dburn: What you are doing is claiming that East underbid with 1NT, but that is because you saw all four hands. Maybe West underbid by passing 2@s.|pg||
nt|cindy: no  it is NOT because i saw all four hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S is a tad wet|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: certainly the 3 mowen hace been in the JC for the last 4 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can do a lot of damage to this, buti cant double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction can;t be right, can it?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Is this right Helen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this right?|pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT sahowed a @S stop     .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N may feel that facing a NV weak 2 they are not necessarily odds-on to make game, and they are not that likely to beat 4S more than one|pg||
nt|bobh1: She has 3 tricks, maybe partner has one |pg||
nt|capercliff: now to mke it|pg||
nt|idblu: this helps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another tricky contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1NT looks like the bid of a player who has not seen the 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: :(   no problem |pg||
nt|cindy: i totally believe in upgrading with a good five card suit   |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: lots of undos|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: women|pg||
nt|mamos: it's very hard to do vugraph operation thanks to our op she's done great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: absolute the best lead!|pg||
nt|cindy: and all aces and kings outside|pg||
nt|cindy: and W also underbid|pg||
nt|cindy: conconservatives|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservatives|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: who likes 2@h over 2@s|pg||
nt|idblu: at least 3@H, 1@S and 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Jack was the card...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: daclarer a chance now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all pass the North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, it may lead to 4@S being doubled |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope  wrong operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it may be 3 hearts from west, etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator pls undo!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Helens done really well so far, thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: AFTER 2@S PASS BY S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... but its hard not to bid 2 spades also|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok this is a short version of the bidding|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cindy: i assure you i make no comments based on seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not me i play 21|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: 2/1|pg||

nt|mdgraham: broadcast.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well at least the @H game was not likely to be found either|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
nt|mamos: and ew are to high|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@H E bid 3NT and W 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 2 spades went -2 OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like it would help, right?|pg||
nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair I open|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT looks possible |pg||
nt|idblu: made 1N in OR|pg||
nt|capercliff: passing twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Borderline whther she should re-open or not. After all partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Also thanks to my fellow commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA), Mike Amos and Ben Green(England). I am Mike Graham (also England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments.  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like passing vs Acol (say) as they are usually in the wrong contract cf 15 in OR|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and could not act over 1@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: he would cuebid 3@S over 3 @H   yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope all comments are based on experience|pg||
nt|capercliff: if S cant bid over 1@c then there is no future|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eggy: well Cat has, but 3 year ago they were struggling to put a team in at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when i make comments i usually haven;t even seen any of the hands|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: every defender's nightmare - the double void|pg||

nt|mamos: round - If NI have won England may need to score well to overtake them (NI are sitting out the last match) If Scotland have won they may in contention in the final match  should be ...|pg||
nt|mamos: fun|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: she :)|pg||
nt|mamos: mine mostly based on ignorance :(|pg||
nt|capercliff: then again I would have bid 1@h over 1@c|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: play seems to have drifted now..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|cindy: not agreeing with either of you|pg||
nt|idblu: N will get endplayed in @D eventually|pg||
nt|mariner1: last two EW bids reminds me of the Gadarene Swine Law :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|april7: then 4@C by E and might end up to high though|pg||
nt|cindy: mike and marshall|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idblu: auction will go the same|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: needs to establish a diamond trick, though- |pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: cannot bid 3@S and 4@C simultaneously Avram|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual lol|pg||
nt|mamos: ow?|pg||
nt|cindy: ew?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I liked that Mike! But you must consider bidding and the hand who has to act|pg||
nt|mamos: did declarer duck @Dk|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1:  http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Tournament site|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E did not bid 4S. he barely had a 2S bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +1 for a push now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||
nt|daman: West will not cue|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|hedyg: he bid 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: and cindy and Marshall and ralf|pg||

nt|mamos: helen well done|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have to say i could hardly pass 4S once S has doubled 3C. there goes my whole hand on defense|pg||
nt|mamos: Thanks to BBo and thank you|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult hand for NS to handle|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south does well to remove the x of 3 spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon South has enough to raise to 5@D - North has followed a very strong sequence|pg||
nt|mamos: South has not understood how strong North was|pg||
nt|mamos: forcing p to bid at the Four level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and diffcult to bid 5 clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: hmmmm  E-W  are playing in the open room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
nt|mamos: Scotland have missed the game bid by Paul and MacIntosh in the open Room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S names are OK, but we need some English players as E-W. The names we have now are Scottish|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and they are playing in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk5: About to be corrected|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks operator|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: South for Scotland is Ruaridh Ellison from Kirkcudbright|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that lead may tip declarer off - may well try both major aces|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: this has chances as cards lie|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ruth Connolly decided to teach the boys a lesson|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: thanks to the NIBU and especially Sandie Milership for sharing the event with us and thanks to yo all for coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South in the other room bid 1NT, but the spade stopper looks a bit iffy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|idblu: nowadays a weak 2 in a major can have 4 in the other major|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: results are now up for first four rounds http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: Does anyone know reults for other tables this round?|pg||
nt|idblu: this should make easily|pg||
nt|jtr: I am the only one just north of it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so thanks David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: make sure the youngsters get to bed early David!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Cindy. A third hand opening is to prefer here|pg||
nt|jtr: Pleasure:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: could easily be a double game swing, especially if S has a stiff diamond, which is far from unlikely|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|mamos: bye all :))|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a last board win for England, thanks to all in Belfast and see you soon |pg||
pc|d4|nt|oliverc: I must confess, opening the West hand with 1NT when 2@C isn't 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|oliverc: seems a little self-defeating to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that even with 1S opener they would have stopped in 3S which looks enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well there are a few schools of thought on that subject Fred|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable hts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most come down against that one|pg||
nt|idblu: anyone do a bed check?|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to bbo and to NIBU especially Sandy Millership (last year after the dinner on Sunday we played Speedball at about 1am and Sandy was the winner |pg||
nt|jtr: The dogs?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|mamos: 1@S opening seems normal in third at favorable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: unless it's a very weak suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't disagree....but many do....very old school :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: looksm like about 11 tricks probbaly two trumpo tricks for the defence now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on this hand EW would have found game with west passing, so no harm done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike can you go next time and do the running scores for them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and post the CCs whilst you are at it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Looks like a big win for Wales, thought Irlenad have a probable game swing on board 20|pg||
nt|mamos: what lesson was that  Kath? looks like a make to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: disaster for the girls this match|pg||
nt|mariner1: bye all!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some good learning points though|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|idblu: thx again..gn all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: phew it was a hard set|pg||
nt|dburn: and something of a pickup here also|pg||
nt|mamos: Looks like the WElsh will win this match which will please them and their supporters (not to mention my wife)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S looks as if it needs heart finesse + 3-3 hearts - although in practice the spade position helps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: a @h lead had made the contract a little bit more sensible|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may make 11 for 16-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: id be surprised tho if the west hand qualified for the bid that was made|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still a maximum win for England|pg||
mc|9|nt|cuttysark: Yes - nice attitude|pg||
