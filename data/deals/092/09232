nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H seems enough here (or the equivalent)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|mrt2000: straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||

nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
