nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||

nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||

nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an| |nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
mb|5N|nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
mb|6S|nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk7: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 2 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|james_h: Morning John|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||
nt|paulg: North's lack of a double may work to his advantage here|pg||
nt|paulg: as I expect Spears will eventually play the @sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange bidding & strange defense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ht then best of a bad lot|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|viren169: declarer will eliminate the hand and end up hooking the spade Q when nothing else works.|pg||

nt|finch: fantasy question: can EW make 6@C?  Slightly less fantasy question: can they make 6@H?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: and he can endplay east again|pg||
nt|jallerton: should have played the J|pg||

nt|viren169: may try a cheap trick by leading the J of @S in the process... |pg||
nt|mowen: 6@H looks ok |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and strange line of play for that matter|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have seen the position|pg||
nt|finch: double dummy, 6@S was makeable.  But cashing one top spade was too late, so no-one will make at the table|pg||
nt|mowen: how?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, it was a play at the end, yes. but if E wins heart ace and leads a club at that point, declarer is down in cold contract|pg||
nt|mayors: Very thin 4@h NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg: 1@c lead directional and not expecting to bid again|pg||
nt|mowen: how strong?|pg||
nt|finch: yes, a 9-count opposite a strong NT is likely to bid it, however|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT is 14-16 in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|mayors: @s lead should beat it|pg||

mb|2H|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||

nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: looks like declarer will get the trumps right and come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agree|pg||
nt|viren169: via 5@S + 4@C + 1@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: line taken should be high @C, AK@S |pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy: if W had raised clubs, N could make resp dbl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-wind now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 5S re-bubbled|pg||
nt|james_h: odd double considering he is on lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance here|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek thinks oh No!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|james_h: no|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mayors: They have to lead spade to beat it, otherwise with @D guess makes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||
nt|ciaran: selway now wishing he had doubled! will soon be glad he did not!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, 2@C was normal stayman.  The system changes completely when responder is a passed hand.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: Spade goes on long @c with them 3-3|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Reissmann from England|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|mayors: I think he'll get @d right on the lead  as well|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|james_h: just trying to set the scene|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkirl: nope  lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i tyhink there is a play for an overtrick after all if declarer elminates the reds tghen plays a club to the J east will be endplayed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
nt|viren169: caught West napping!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barbyh: who knew clubs cd be so premptive|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mayors: although when it comes to the guess he won't know clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|finch: well, he'll know that West didn't lead a club away from the king, how does that tell him that we would lead a diamond from the queen?|pg||
nt|finch: as you say, if West plays a diamond now he may finesse as that will generate a spade discard from table if the queen is right|pg||
nt|mowen: tough choice for west now|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe just return a club|pg||
nt|mowen: a diamond is much more likely to be from Ace than Queen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: easy come... easy go!|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond discard was reverse count in diamonds, I believe, or possibly suit preference|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes agree Steve.  I think he's going to make from here|pg||
nt|mowen: a good result if he does|pg||
nt|finch: counting his entries, he should win the spade in the dummy|pg||
nt|mowen: play the king to keep ace as an entry|pg||
nt|finch: if he wins in hand East can duck the second club, win the third and stick declarer in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mayors: The lead deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  |pg||
nt|mowen: is a spade obvious?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|paulg: the other perennial question is whether to overcall or double with 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mowen: and which one?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|finch: I don't mind a club that much (which would not be successful) but I hate the trump lead|pg||
nt|mayors: low or J I don't mind that much|pg||
nt|finch: Jon Cooke may have decided to take the diamond finesse instead by winning hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: hes got enuf trumps to do it entry wise too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barbyh: when your sp suit is q 5th and you hts much better Im for dbling|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|finch: a spade back still beats it at this point|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mayors: Surely he's going to play a spade now|pg||
nt|finch: no|pg||
nt|mayors: he knows partner has @c ace|pg||
nt|finch: By the way, either Vugraph has crashed, or Robson is still thinking in 6@S on board 18|pg||
nt|mayors: I think cooke is going to finesse here|pg||
nt|mowen: will he believe he has AQ?|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite difficult to work out what West's hand might be, as this defence is very strange|pg||
nt|finch: he probably 'ought' to finesse, as that is what he had decided to play for originally|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: now back to the 10 we had at the start!|pg||

nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||

mb|2S|an| |nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
mb|4H|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
pc|h8|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||

pc|h3|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and vul v non-vul, why stick ur neck out?|pg||
nt|viren169: +80 is likley to create a small swing with only 7 tricks available.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: and east has set up the ninth trick but what could he do|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even then i would overcall rather than double. but i would overcall the four-card suit instead of the five:   xxxxx  AKQx  xx Ax|pg||
nt|paulg: a slightly soft defence, but only overtricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|finch: either the lead works well or you've let the contract through... I think the former happens more often than the latter|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|jferg: although lavery show know after the rebid partner has 11 13|pg||
nt|jferg: too late now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||
nt|cindy: needed AKQJ of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: might get heart lead now i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: but shouldnt stop W from play @ss when he gets in|pg||
nt|jferg: still time for a spade switch from sime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|4S|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
pc|s5|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|chick: not me, because (1) I don't like 4 card overcalls, and (2) it has no value for taking up room|pg||

mb|d|nt|frankaus: they could catch them by the tinme of the autumn nationals :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shipf?    |pg||

nt|ahollan1: my source for info on the convention is http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8-to-5 on what little remains in the coffers -- that 1 imp won't come into play in the final result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S sort of like 4th suit forcing -- hoping partner held @S stopper|pg||
nt|mildredb: what a sport - 8 to 5 :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: we will get u a job with betfair with such generous odds al|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@H is risky however no DBL|pg||
nt|chick: It's not our hand, so why help the opps with info about where our values are|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i want a diamond lead if we defend|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i admit -  i stole 8-to-5 from an old Rat Pack bit [Sinatra, Martin, Davis]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: you bid because you also hold 4 weak @S,,,,,, get something in JIC|pg||
nt|davidstern: IT will certainly never be your hand if you dont get into the auction. Favourable vul you may have a save and I would like a diamond lead not a heart|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||

nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||

nt|james_h: I'll leave that slam to Jacko the Irish team captain|pg||

nt|finch: but the system file has very little about competitive auctions after the opposing side has opened, so I'm not so sure of their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2NT is 11/12 balanced|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg: that will make on the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg: 4@s will be keycard, and 5@d shows 2 of the 5 aces without the @hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: why do those passes keep getting alerted ?  :)   cause S really wants to bid ?|pg||
nt|paulg: Liz, our operator, is trying to alert the previous call|pg||
nt|paulg: but the bbo software is not quite as intuitive as you'd like (as an operator)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4-2-2?|pg||

nt|jallerton: 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: see i thought it was super intuitive, knowing S really wanted to bid|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: There is a school of thought that 4th hand should overcall 1NT a lot more freely these days|pg||

nt|finch: the lead wasn't systemic|pg||

nt|jallerton: on the basis that people open and resond very light|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D 4th suit force|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: If they play 4N as quant, N will pass and another poor result|pg||
nt|davidstern: As I said why try 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the worry with 7@D would be a 4 - 1 break,,,,,, N could describe his shape|pg||

nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||

nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
mb|4C|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||

nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: so maybe nom defence to beat it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the 3S bid should be forcing in that sequence|pg||

nt|james_h: Its a good bidders game not any bidders game|pg||
nt|ianrei: N could still have beaten it by playing a D instead of the second S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@d on this one?  Roland would be in it.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|paulg: i'm sure we'll all be happy with this takeout double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's what a double of 1NT should look like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ew need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: another hand where EW may get a bit high.  11 opposite 11 may be 'opening bid opposite opening bid' but that doesn't mean game|pg||
nt|finch: (unless you are Meckwell)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: they need to play 1Nx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H strikes me as a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|cindy: what is W piping up about ?|pg||
nt|ciaran: it certainly is a sound debut - this has not been a set for bidding pessimistically|pg||
nt|james_h: I like your style, but it means you are always on the limit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes, just 3 losers|pg||
nt|viren169: West seems to have been brushed aside looking at the best hand at the table...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is enuf work to do in 5d altho on this lay out 6 may roll in|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 5@d is more realistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i preecit that they will not get higher than 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: surely it shows more than 2 jacks|pg||
nt|viren169: dangerous dble by Brunner|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: might not even reach that|pg||
nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mowen: they might stop in 2M|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: With evey finesse right, looks like there are 11 tricks available in spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers that score is geting healthy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|viren169: dble will hold declarer to 5/6 tricks on good defense!|pg||
nt|ianrei: how about 3NT - they might bid that|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d - how strong is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now that any bit of candyfloss counts as a stop for nt purposes that may be true|pg||
nt|ianrei: surely 2H FSF?|pg||
nt|jallerton: they play strong @c but even so|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cindy: and what about N and that 3D ?|pg||
nt|jferg: over here we bid if we have nothing otherwise passing suggests we want to penalise the opposition|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|cindy: so to stay out of trouble, you have to stay home|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so what if you have xxx xxxx xxx xxx|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..for E/W with half the points and a 9 card fit, 1@D is their limit|pg||
nt|viren169: If East cannot bid over 3@H best to let it go by West...|pg||
nt|sharkirl: carnage|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 5@D better|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead... trump back!|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: double is a support double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they cant unravel the clubs so tis would make if thatswhere they play|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C artificial of some form (probably forcing 2@D) - I guess 2@H is 5-4 majors invitational now|pg||
nt|finch: you were right, Steve|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: you bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cringe|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ianrei: Lester didn't like 3NT with J9xxx opposite a void|pg||
nt|lestergold: such reluctance to play 5 of aminor these days even in non match point scoring|pg||
nt|ianrei: now 9xxx opposite Q !|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jferg: say oppo open 12-14 nt and p x what do you do if oppo bid 2c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have trouble thirsting to play those methods. |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: would have to do a lot of drinking first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nothing that some acapulco gold couldn;t fix|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club king now for the sure set|pg||
nt|jferg: we lay arescue system called helvic where xx showsa five card suit and 2c shows c & dias etc|pg||

pc|s7|nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok plan B, try to let this make|pg||

nt|viren169: Declarer is making an effort here... not sure about the defense!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait, i am confused, whose bidding are we talking about? i thought all this was prompted by cindy's comment about the 2H call, but now it seems we are duiscussing S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: playing 5@D undoubled in Open Room|pg||
nt|viren169: Now only 3 off!|pg||
nt|mowen: south is sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: i was talking about 2H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: wit all the club discards can pobably afford the spade finesse for the overtrick|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg: so the swing will depend on whether he makes 5 or 6 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|paulg: N/S play 2NT as 20-22 ... that is a large range so no reason to upgrade poor 19 counts|pg||
nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||
nt|jferg: yes when 1nt was x and coffey bid 2c he was showing clubs and dias, if sime paases he shows willingness to x a bid showa weakness|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||

nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||

nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||

nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||
nt|finch: if the acution starts 1NT (weak) double and NS find their heart fit, you can see that might happen|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg: true|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops now we could see down a lot|pg||
nt|mowen: not optimum|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ciaran: This will make for 5 imps to England|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: If N ducks, E can stop the ruff by crossing and taking a @h finesse - not necessary in 4@c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: still thinking of !4S hand i suspect |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: I think the @H2 at trick 1 must have been count, Cooke could see no future in a club switch if declarer had four diamonds|pg||

nt|lestergold: well mayeb just as well the thin maybe anorexic game wasnt bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West was playing a 14-16 point 1NT at the other table, so East made a game try, his partner not accepting.|pg||
nt|jallerton: A great result for Wales in other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ciaran: Another big board - 7@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould tell a tall tale|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have excellent save in hearts against n/s spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: doube fit territory always measn both sides can make lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ianrei: Not a happy choice of X of 4S by East in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our deliberately anonymous operator, good work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hard to bid in most natural systems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaastrous|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A trump lead solved the problem in that suit and declarer soon had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If 2@s shows specifically the red suits, that makes it easier to bid on as East|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: i have to bid something with N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the sponsors, commentators and spectators who laughed at our jokes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this double is presumably conventional|pg||
nt|jferg: no pen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H followed by 4D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Board was flat in 7@H in the Wales - Scotland match I believe|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach a thin 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: another fairly gentle game here, should be a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: why would W pass then ?|pg||
nt|jferg: and lavery will xx to show a five card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator says double is penalty|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think E should get this right anyway|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: a bid that would not occur to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double should show a minor or 4M, 5m hand|pg||
nt|jferg: prefers poker|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C now|pg||
nt|james_h: and they are on the road|pg||
nt|lestergold: now eastmust kbnow that his hand is not suitable for defending|pg||
nt|finch: this will turn into a very close match|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or russian roulette with FIVE chambers loaded|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i can deal with 2S|pg||
nt|paulg: this looks easier to play than 2@h|pg||
nt|cindy: i see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good judgement by DFenning|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the kilkl point of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: 3C would have gotten hammered, no doubt|pg||
nt|james_h: terry might show the Hq here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ciaran: sorry - EBU - NI match was the one where 7@H was reached at both tables - well done|pg||
nt|mowen: flat board|pg||
pc|s9|nt|viren169: not a good start for defense...|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5H was going -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least east /west havent found a foolish double |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|petepunt: with IRE being thumped it could be vwery interesting 2morrow, Scot back in picture now too|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: prefer 5C there from S|pg||
nt|ianrei: S disappointed at dummy|pg||
nt|ianrei: was it really worth 3S ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: oh well flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gives a better chance of reaching 7 on this layout alright|pg||
nt|james_h: Peter Goodman suggests 5nt to show the 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|viren169: problem either min is best on this bidding seq...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cindy: well, striking gold|pg||
nt|viren169: now a flat board...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ciaran: Usually don't show voids in partner's first is suit thoug, so may expect void in a minor?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|paulg: that diamond switch concedes an additional IMP|pg||
nt|ciaran: first bid suit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
mc|10|nt|cindy: no ?|pg||

nt|paulg: broadcast|pg||
nt|paulg: Also all of my fellow commentators and all the kibitzers who have helped|pg||
nt|paulg: Next segment starts at 2155 GMT, or in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when the double you in 1nt, run (Martin's law)|pg||
nt|cindy: who is Martin ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the immigration officer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mart's in-law?|pg||
nt|cindy: oh its you    you said it like it was someone else|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another big chance|pg||
nt|james_h: Its a great debut for Terry and Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: This looks about a 50/50 slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes DK and SA out|pg||
nt|viren169: last one now...|pg||
nt|finch: This is the last board.  Thank you to the vugraph operator, and my excellent co-commentators Steve Ray, Graham Osborne & Peter Goodman.|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks also to the English Bridge Union and Bridge Great Britain for organising the broadcast.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: i play weak no trump sometimes|pg||
nt|jferg: do you have a rescue agreed when x|pg||
nt|finch: Finally thanks to BBO and a special thank you to Roland Wald for all his hard work. We return to the Camrose at 10 am GMT tomorrow morning.|pg||
nt|finch: The Welsh got off to a good lead of a diamond from the North hand at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: a chance for Wales here as 41H looks makeable|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor fr  N/S looks makeable|pg||
nt|finch: looks very hard to beat when played by the long hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
nt|ianrei: tough decision for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Cooke and Garvey muddling the auction on not many values|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@H looks like a good raise to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: west hand improved now|pg||
nt|mowen: but what to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
nt|finch: decalrer must feel in a lot of trouble, but he can't really go off with South having everything|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: byeee|pg||
nt|finch: oops.... all Cooke has to do is win and play another club|pg||
nt|finch: looks like West didn't count his tricks properly, he's trying to get out for one off|pg||
nt|petepunt: blocking @H complicated things|pg||
nt|mowen: key moment|pg||
nt|mowen: it could be right to win and play K@D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump back would have sunk the ship|pg||
nt|cindy: thx all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|mowen: to kill the @Hs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
mc|9|nt|finch: yes, hard to believe that West actually played that way with that hand!|pg||
nt|finch: thanks all.  back tomorrow|pg||
nt|mowen: strange one error causes another|pg||
nt|mowen: goodbye all|pg||
nt|petepunt: night all|pg||
pg||
