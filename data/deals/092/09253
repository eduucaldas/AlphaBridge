nt|copeyj: I don't like the 2@D bid - i would prefer either of the other two options (2@H or 2@S)|pg||
nt|hardkxre: it was a sporty spot 2@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: but 8 tricks was a good result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: so you see the ways to stay alive when you are too old playing juniors... you become a commentator, a npc, a webmaster or so, then you can still stay in touch with junior bridge ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: and with this nice event|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Very true. I was a junior in 1911|pg||
nt|copeyj: weak NT for N/S Thomas?|pg||
nt|hardkxre: looks like it|pg||
nt|tomi2: I doubt weak NT|pg||
nt|hardkxre: as in the closed room|pg||
nt|copeyj: same as in the other room - very unusual|pg||
mb|2C!|an|inverted|nt|copeyj: well if they arent playing weak NT why the 1@C bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: would bet on strong NT, they play very natural standard methods|pg||
nt|hardkxre: 11 tricks seems like a lot|pg||
nt|tomi2: I can't say|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n looks like a unner with the very favourale lub position and unthreatening diamond break|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hardkxre: the card lie nicesly for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/U-28/Germany/eggeling-matthias.pdf|pg||
nt|copeyj: even on @D lead, and double duck in @C you can get to dummy in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: they play 15-17 ???|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 'normal' low heart here would prove that old fashioned leadin g methods dont always work well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: I would lead @H3 and look like a fool|pg||
nt|tomi2: I doubt they have changed their system since then|pg||
nt|lestergold: providing he putst he nine in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not alone I notice|pg||
nt|copeyj: well if they have not then not opening 1NT is very odd|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|tomi2: S must still raise|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: me too Roland but im used to looking like a fool on lead and two way finesses especially|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: south comes from wrong counry to know about the curse of scotland and her relative the 9H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange play that was|pg||
nt|hardkxre: not the most forunate play so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: very|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now anything but a heart beats it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm offered a gift at trick one didnt take it but gacve a gift back to teh defence|pg||
nt|tomi2: hard to work out not leading @H into this dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs thick trousers because hell be kicking himself unless east returns a heart which he might|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well a heart may have no future since Lars knows declarer has 4 as well|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hardkxre: still looks farely natural|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|tomi2: after winnin the trick with he ace South is probably marked with AKQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a ping pong of errors|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|hardkxre: it might still go down|pg||
nt|copeyj: indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then again it was hard for the defense since they will not play south for having an normal 1nt opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: its naturakl for south to play as dim up on the grounds that either ace of dims with west or Ks with east will see him home roughly 75%|pg||
nt|hardkxre: south needs to play a diamond to the king, run the clubs and west will be caught in a squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have three ladies at the table, Mike. Only East is not|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: just a question of how many bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north must be thinking of the grand with that incredible hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D RKCB in german methods|pg||
nt|hardkxre: this shouldn't be difficult to bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: just want s to know if pard has ace nad queen of dims id have thought|pg||
nt|copeyj: K@S relevant too Mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3rd round @C to take care of|pg||
nt|hardkxre: if it's also posible to check the kings in German methods :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: now again one keypoint in pdship discussing: 4nt now ask for @DQ or is to play since 2KC are missing probably|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but with hearts available as a sopurce of tricks not likely to be side suit losers if south has promised strong no trump values|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 5@C shows @DQ and @CK|pg||
nt|copeyj: south has shown a weak NT mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: !|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im blind|pg||
nt|hardkxre: 7@D looks like a fair shot now|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes ive looked at it and it doesnt maske any sense to me|pg||
nt|tomi2: hard to bid this after weak NT start, lucky our girls changed their system after privius board ;)  no... you must be playing some sort of relays after 1NT to find out partners ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: shape and excellent cover cards|pg||
nt|hardkxre: even after a week 1nt opening, transfer to hearts followed by a natural 3@D should get you there easily|pg||

nt|tomi2: after transfer and 3@D you still miss the chance to hit partner on 5 clubs and 7@C beeing the best spot|pg||

nt|hardkxre: 8 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|hardkxre: Denmark just picked up 12 imps on board 10 and are now in the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 easy tricks and many opportunities for a ninth in the wash- the spade lead means that after clubs have been established east can pin the pesky 7 spades when leading to dummy to ...|pg||
