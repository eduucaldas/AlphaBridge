nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||

nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||

nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||

nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||

nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||

nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||

pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||

mb|4C|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||

nt|athene: well cashing the @HA finds the second spade loser :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: then why -2 in CR?|pg||

nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|cicus: 3@C is 5 cards|pg||

nt|hedyg: desperately looking for a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East should protect over weak 2@H more difficult over multi|pg||
nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||

nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||

nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c5|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cK|nt|viren169: North needs to be careful not to concede an overtrick...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would make an early @d pitch, hoping declarer has the j.|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws a diamond, he will have to give a trick to the @CK for +1|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||

nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||

nt|viren169: worth another try...|pg||
nt|athene: well if 2nt was normal Jacoby then east should have rebid 3@H showing the singleton, but either they don't play that, or east preferred to lie just to show a minimum|pg||

nt|ady: you were right Pedro|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not exactly a runaway match.|pg||
nt|viren169: any views about J2N?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was OK i think - west's hand was just too strong for a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: but of course we don't know exactly what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2NT was jacoby (3 @h were short but Soucasaux prefer to say was minimum)|pg||
nt|athene: yes ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|16+p, ANY|mb|1H|nt|athene: this auction's course will all depend on whether north finds a response to 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|ady: good chance of  4@S here    would have to misguess both majors  to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: if E/W misguess both @h and @s (and this one they will) 4@s or @s is minus 1 otherwise...|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D rather tame   but west would be in at a higher level|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: another partscore|pg||
mb|d!|an|penalty|nt|santyclz: W is a passed hand so surely can affort 3@d.|pg||

nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W here|pg||

nt|athene: judging by board 10, it will stop a while after it should have done :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: east, with 10 black cards, is entitled to hope for a fit somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north passed over 1@C??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but will be disappointed :)|pg||
mb|5C|an|!Cs and !Ds|nt|ady: 3 clubs now  should end the auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: surely cant be thinking of bidding on   partner has shown some values in his void  and he has a light opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: but think 3 @c is the limit...|pg||
nt|ady: surely must be   otherwise Pinto cant compete    and his is not shy   |pg||
nt|viren169: diamonds lost now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: oops|pg||
nt|athene: but apart from only have 2-2 in his partner's suits, west's hand is actually quite suitable|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: Maybe Pessanha has lost his pass cards|pg||
nt|athene: *only having|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: And, in fact 6@ss can make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Gave his pd a stiff @s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok. once again thx all. See u tomorrow at 15.15 london time|pg||
nt|athene: well, i know diamonds are a minor suit, but it's not actually illegal to bid those yet|pg||
nt|athene: soon it will be, no doubt|pg||
nt|athene: even 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: or 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - 7NT isn't making i don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not yet... may be in the US!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
nt|athene: well, the opening lead solves one of declarer's problems|pg||
