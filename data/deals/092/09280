nt|Walddk2: I don't like a system where you must jump to 3NT to show 25-27. It's better to play Kokish Relay|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: My first sequence:  2@S by responder now asks opener to bid 2NT with 22-24. If opener bypasses 2@H  (2@C  2@D  ;   2NT) it's the 25+ balanced hand. I can recommend Kokish|pg||
