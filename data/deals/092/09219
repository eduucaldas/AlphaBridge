pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|finch: Knowing that the defence wil always duck the first round of spades, he's actually on a guess at the next trick|pg||
nt|finch: as he just needs two spade tricks, but they cannot be slow ones|pg||
nt|finch: that makes the low club lead better than a non-club lead, as on a red suit he needs the spades to come in|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mayors: NS getting a bit high on this misfit|pg||
nt|finch: At the other table EW play a strong club, and the 1@D opening from East helped NS keep the auction low|pg||
nt|finch: East has a horrible lead problem|pg||
pc|s5|nt|finch: What would you lead on that auction?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mayors: A @s is not unreasonable. North sounds very short and south probably has only 5|pg||
nt|finch: EW can take the first 6 tricks, but the diamond position is not how West will expect it|pg||
nt|finch: In fact, I expect West is most likely to duck here, just to try and hurt their communications, but it's more likely to hurt the EW ones|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|finch: East led a club against 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|mayors: Now low @c?|pg||
nt|finch: I guess so.  Remember that East's 1@C opening could just as well be on a 3=4=4=2 distribution|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|finch: If declarer could read the opening lead as shortage, he knows East has all the remaining high cards|pg||
nt|finch: the problem is that doesn't help him much|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|finch: They'll probably be quite some Robsonian thought here.|pg||
nt|finch: In particular, is it right to cash the other top spade at this point?|pg||
nt|finch: He knows that his partner is going to be endplayed, and otherwise they may never make it|pg||
nt|finch: ...but against that it sets up dummy's suit|pg||
nt|mayors: I think he may well switch to @hs|pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can see that one card through is enough with Qx in dummy|pg||
nt|mayors: Qx is in declarer|pg||
nt|finch: good point|pg||
nt|mayors: The fact that declarer hasn't played on @h may well suggest partner has strength and length there|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d6|pc|h7|nt|finch: yes, he bid diamonds and played on clubs, and fairly obviously had singleton @SQ|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mayors: so a tidy pick-up for EBU coming here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h8|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: East marked 12-14 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: 7NT 7@C |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good Scotty score from OR|pg||
nt|olson: clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pdjourdain: Heres the grand slam. Murdoch left the spade guess to last and knew the shape|pg||
nt|olson: 12/14  nt  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: pass or xfer to @Ss?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sommer: 2N is 10+ with 4c @H|pg||
nt|granguru: some played only 6@cs here...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In vulnerable and with a so bad hand! Pass is the only bid for me.|pg||
nt|viren169: and now? Pass or dble?|pg||
nt|olson: not sure why S  wants to bid  on that hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: so this is a critical hand for the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S should be a @C transfer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In modern bidding there is no penalty doubles...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|sommer: ..called Truscot|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3C shows fit, 3S nat|pg||
nt|granguru: S didnt super-accept|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed Patrick. Murdoch discovered that spades were 4-2 and played, with the odds, the hand with 4 for the queen|pg||
nt|granguru: so he did accept|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|viren169: this will be no walk in the park...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|granguru: 7 depends on @SQ|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now 4H cue|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|viren169: we have specs split over pass and xfer (assuming South had passed)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: setting suit with 4C allows Keycard|pg||
nt|granguru: there is also (not here) a chance for a @S-@D squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 could have been laydown. Give South @SQ instead of @HQ. Not so easy to find out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so both aces AND club queen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary knows it is at worst on the spade guess|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: should try for 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: correct, and it may be better than that. 7 is a fair shot|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|granguru: probably 5n would have found no K and the chance for the @SQ would have been reasonably high..|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: some play a possible canopy there so north may only know of 4 diamonds|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mayors: 6@c a bit wild. If you want to try for slam at least start with 4@c and then you can stop below if it seems appropriate|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: comparisons start to come in now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With this hand you can bid reverse and with a weaker 4441 i open with 1@d. It´s better to lie in minor than major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like operator error on the last|pg||
mb|1H|nt|granguru: Only way to beat 4@S is a @D lead |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again the Welsh can defend the strong club agressively|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru: and after the @SA underlead @Cs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: @S overcall?|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: sorry  no ruff possible|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Allowed east in easily|pg||
nt|granguru: single @SA|pg||
nt|granguru: so 4@S is unbeatable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru: but 5@C and 5@H are good defenses|pg||
nt|viren169: without the T I would probably pass...|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3@D by n is "fit no-jump" bid|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Easier for e-W to sacrifice now, 5Cx is 2 off with a H ruff|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well 3N off on a club lead, so this is right as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, E will be happy to see a losing @Dfiensse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..finesse, even|pg||
nt|granguru: it show a 3@S bid (4 cards) with a side @D suit..preparing a defense if double fitted with partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Had N raised to 4S East might still dbl but it is tougher|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after double I had tried 2@d on N|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East is worth a bit more than just a raise...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|viren169: maybe 2@S as a general game try|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|granguru: the double shows @H so 4@H is a support bid by West|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like they missed 5@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: ..with the pointed kings swicted, 3NT would be an easy make|pg||
nt|granguru: I think it can be made..playing @HAK|pg||
nt|viren169: or 4@H|pg||
nt|viren169: the overcall of 1@S should have helped E/W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a 3-3 split and @hQ on side but 5@c looks easier|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|finch: yes, although East might have raised a red pre-empt to 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p!|nt|finch: mind you, that gives them the alternative option of +500 so probably not such a great idea|pg||
nt|finch: Allfrey|pg||

nt|finch: I'm fairly cofident you can make double dummy on a spade lead, but it may involve playing West for his precise hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|finch: The diamond lead doesn't immediately cost a trick, but it does tell declarer the diamond position which may help|pg||

nt|mayors: He can be certain the lead is a singleton after Allfrey suggested a @s lead|pg||
nt|finch: ...and the other thing the lead did was tell him that West may have some heart length|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|finch: Allfrey can see no future in the red suits, it must be either a spade or a trump|pg||
