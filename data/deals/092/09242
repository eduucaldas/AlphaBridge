nt|marlowepi: welcome back all. scotland didn't get kilt in the first half, but they do trail by the narrowest of margins|pg||
nt|viren169: hi all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: and we're off.|pg||
nt|eamongall: at first glance I don't see much for anyone ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I will hazard a guess at EW playing in 1NT |pg||
nt|viren169: Off we go...|pg||
nt|mowen: Could make a difference - probably to who comes 2nd!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|viren169: Is Norman in his seat?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: Morning all|pg||

nt|mowen: hi all|pg||
nt|finch: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
nt|mowen: EBU have done v well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tim :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dreaded 4441 hand to start...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: Hi all|pg||
nt|finch: x was 7+ balanced|pg||
nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|mowen: well someone is in his seat:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
nt|eamongall: For EBU we have Martin Garvey and Jon Cooke a regular pairing playing on BBO most nights with various English juniors and ex-junios|pg||
nt|viren169: Selway is there now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb: DOIGB|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is destined to go off...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: which stands for Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 2N...|pg||
nt|mowen: yup, looks like -1|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S is enough after overcalling...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: That is Walsh not Walshe operator|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer.|pg||
nt|chick: making is better :)|pg||
nt|mowen: a bit keen, I think|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: 2@h transfer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||
nt|eamongall: for Ireland we have Derek O Gorman ...who played in World Pairs Final back in 1990 as a 20 year old  but has been retired since about 1993 from serious bridge |pg||
nt|ppiglett: West missed the suit pref card of the 6D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wanted to set up his spades if pd had xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: and his partner Terry Walsh who is well known on the Dublin bridge scene..|pg||
nt|eamongall: both making their Camrose debut |pg||
nt|eamongall: I take a point from the gallery ...."Camrose is not serious bridge" ...  I think the players involved are taking it seriously |pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: Declarer will be uncomfortable in 2N but will eventually come up with 8 tricks!|pg||
nt|viren169: bit too much to drink?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jallerton: S was never going to find @cK lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lucky lead the favourable lie oft he sapdes looks like will see this soemwhat shaky 3n home|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: odd not to cash a top club before the third spade|pg||
nt|henryb: well on this hand N-S would make 3@c for 110, and 3@h will lose two diamonds and one of each for -50|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ppiglett: Agreed about the S but one off is a f|pg||
nt|ppiglett: good plan|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: Ohno Team has 4 of players who won 2008 World Mind Sports Games Senior Event in Beijing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 4 players in this event rank  2, 3, 4 and 10  in lifetime points in Japan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is artificial  --- 6+@C and  16-18|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Mr Versace contemplatng...|pg||
nt|frankaus: my team (dawson) was lucky enough to play the cayne team in the qualifying|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as extension to playing Gazzilli -- less than 3@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|frankaus: we were good host - letting them win 11-19 when our other pair chose the wrong game on one board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and still Cayne could only place 2nd in the Qualifying |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C may be part of Turbo -- showing Key Cards rather than using option to ask for KC|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: sorry i meant 4@H -- but spec telling me 4N was Turbo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: either way -- they learned they're off 2 key cards|pg||

nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s or 4@s opener?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: two off would have been better with the club switch!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman from Wales|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: hm, W has written down +100 ... Cooke has -50|pg||
nt|viren169: another 4@S destined to go off...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Peter :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Light opening... yet again!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|mowen: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but will stay till then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: convention cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|petepunt: afternoon all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
nt|eamongall: this appears to have 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|mowen: tempting at this vul|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A little unlucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: he has the none working @S finesse ..available |pg||
nt|eamongall: for a @H pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looking at @hJ|pg||
nt|henryb: really, the false preference! they must promise 5+ clubs for this auction|pg||
nt|chick: many people these days are playing that 1@S shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes rebids 1nt with bal 15-17 even with 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
nt|viren169: Somebody ought to tell Norman he is not as young as he use to be!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eamongall: split trump honors was required ...so unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb: but in that style South should respond 1@h, not 1@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s weak nt |pg||
pc|h3|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eamongall: and the 10 onside contributes our Sydney correspondant Thomas Hanlon|pg||
nt|eamongall: and as maker64 indicates the @D5 can gorw |pg||
nt|ciaran: Promoted a third trump there by overtaking the @D6 if that's how play went|pg||
nt|eamongall: gorw|pg||
pc|c6|nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||
nt|eamongall: grow |pg||
nt|ppiglett: We've all been in worse - Tom?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
pc|s2|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed, but still, if North will rebid 1N with a balanced 15-17, you lose the value of opening 1@c with a strong NT when South does not respond 1@h and North will not rebid 1@h ...|pg||
nt|henryb: with 4|pg||

pc|d2|nt|james_h: Morning John|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||
nt|paulg: North's lack of a double may work to his advantage here|pg||
nt|paulg: as I expect Spears will eventually play the @sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange bidding & strange defense|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: ht then best of a bad lot|pg||

nt|eamongall: you can have takeout tonks ..competitive tonks and lead directing tonks and penalty tonks |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: the Eng-Sco result could be good for EBU, who play Scotland in the last match|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C shows much more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: the n.i pair play a strong club system with 14 16 no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this a weak no trump pair for N ireland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure what South was planning... but it has turned a plus score to a minus!|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||
nt|lestergold: at t5his vulernability i would have ventured 2c by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkp: you can also have insufficient tonks|pg||
nt|viren169: S may tap in on the way out!|pg||
nt|viren169: He has seen 3rd in hand openings before...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Did well to buy this one|pg||
nt|mowen: kindly minor breaks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
nt|henryb: Much more after partner bids 2@d? I think that W hand makes up in playing strength and controls what it lacks in high cards|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be sure if 5@C is a slam try, lead directing, or offer of another place to play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||

nt|chick: fortunately, his 5@H bid is right in all those cases|pg||

nt|jallerton: possible endplay vs N|pg||
nt|lestergold: three qs equally 6 questionable points not really enuf for game opposite a strong nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: small club from dummy, what can North do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to duck but may well not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||

nt|viren169: I guess so!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: well, it was a play at the end, yes. but if E wins heart ace and leads a club at that point, declarer is down in cold contract|pg||
nt|mayors: Very thin 4@h NS|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi John|pg||
nt|viren169: nice dble to show both majs|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|paulg: 1@c lead directional and not expecting to bid again|pg||
nt|mowen: how strong?|pg||
nt|finch: yes, a 9-count opposite a strong NT is likely to bid it, however|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT is 14-16 in 3rd and 4th seats|pg||
nt|mayors: @s lead should beat it|pg||
nt|henryb: that assumes that 5@c was a slam try|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: if S had been 4531 on that hand, W would have had to return the heart queen after taking the D ace|pg||
nt|paulg: South was 4531|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes paul, sorry, i meant, without the Q of diamonds|pg||
nt|barbyh: north is surely shut out now|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no marshall, still making 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: in fact with all th heart tricks, the spade position in unnecessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does S do now|pg||
nt|sharkirl: looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1NT for me - God deals you 17 to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: Can N-S sell to the doomed 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: some folks get into trouble dbling with a 4-3 in the majs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that solves that good old Black|pg||
nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
nt|ciaran: I slightly pefer 1H since you can still get to NT whereas a heart fit might be lost|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 1D opening makes me feel a bit ill|pg||

nt|viren169: Pass seem better over 2@S...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: now W is on the horns|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like best declarer can do is drop he @HJ to escape for -2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Easier to play in 3NT if you overcall 1NT though|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
nt|henryb: and have Scotland win by about 50|pg||
nt|henryb: all very unlikely, but still possible|pg||
pc|d8|nt|james_h: no|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||

nt|jallerton: unlilely that partner has a diamond stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke checking signals now|pg||
nt|eamongall: Peter not everybody would remember Double Diamond ...it was a beer I think |pg||
pc|dK|nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||

nt|ciaran: Yes - every option has flaws..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of bidding on that lot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed - three hearts a spade and a club|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||
nt|jcomyn: question is would Carroll have x 1NT|pg||
nt|ciaran: I expect he would, but Garvey would pull to 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: brilliant|pg||
nt|viren169: Not much extra for East's hand? Any views?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: not you, Cooke's @hQ !|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done.  Continuing the Q was his legitimate play, but the defense at least offered him a losing option by ducking the first @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ppiglett: I dont think he was flying to dummy to finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: Spade goes on long @c with them 3-3|pg||
nt|jallerton: another heart; will declarer finesse?|pg||
nt|petepunt: will be first time Ireland not won for 4 years|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Reissmann from England|pg||
nt|mowen: would never pass over 2@s, but opener might have passed...|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: might make this even!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|ciaran: Yes :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|james_h: just trying to set the scene|pg||
nt|viren169: We have a few specs questioning 3@S too!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkirl: nope  lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i tyhink there is a play for an overtrick after all if declarer elminates the reds tghen plays a club to the J east will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The spade return was not the best and has caused this problem |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||

nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|jcomyn: is there a 6th trick?|pg||
nt|jallerton: No|pg||
nt|ciaran: Though a minute ago, I didn't think there was a 5th trick either|pg||
nt|jallerton: EBU gained by bidding the thin game on board 1.  Ireland played in 3@s =|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mayors: although when it comes to the guess he won't know clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|finch: well, he'll know that West didn't lead a club away from the king, how does that tell him that we would lead a diamond from the queen?|pg||
nt|finch: as you say, if West plays a diamond now he may finesse as that will generate a spade discard from table if the queen is right|pg||
nt|mowen: tough choice for west now|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe just return a club|pg||
nt|mowen: a diamond is much more likely to be from Ace than Queen|pg||
nt|chick: well, it would be more fun to have a lot closer race|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: easy come... easy go!|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond discard was reverse count in diamonds, I believe, or possibly suit preference|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes agree Steve.  I think he's going to make from here|pg||
nt|mowen: a good result if he does|pg||
nt|finch: counting his entries, he should win the spade in the dummy|pg||
nt|mowen: play the king to keep ace as an entry|pg||
nt|finch: if he wins in hand East can duck the second club, win the third and stick declarer in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mayors: The lead deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  |pg||
nt|mowen: is a spade obvious?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S doesnt show anything extra... does it?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg: the other perennial question is whether to overcall or double with 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mowen: and which one?|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wales will still want to winnthis head to head so fun it will be :)|pg||
nt|mowen: But 2@s was not forced - W could have passed over 2@d, with such a minimum hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|finch: I don't mind a club that much (which would not be successful) but I hate the trump lead|pg||
nt|mayors: low or J I don't mind that much|pg||
nt|finch: Jon Cooke may have decided to take the diamond finesse instead by winning hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: hes got enuf trumps to do it entry wise too|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass would deny a maj in my book...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barbyh: when your sp suit is q 5th and you hts much better Im for dbling|pg||
nt|ppiglett: making|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|finch: a spade back still beats it at this point|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mayors: Surely he's going to play a spade now|pg||
nt|finch: no|pg||
nt|mayors: he knows partner has @c ace|pg||
nt|finch: By the way, either Vugraph has crashed, or Robson is still thinking in 6@S on board 18|pg||
nt|mayors: I think cooke is going to finesse here|pg||
nt|mowen: will he believe he has AQ?|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite difficult to work out what West's hand might be, as this defence is very strange|pg||
nt|finch: he probably 'ought' to finesse, as that is what he had decided to play for originally|pg||
nt|mowen: well I think it does, he only has a weak NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: maybe not|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting point... to discuss with your pd... I guess you will get different views on this one|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: now back to the 10 we had at the start!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: i usually overcall unless the 4 card suit quality is much better than 5 card suit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkirl: that has to be wrong|pg||
mc|9|nt|viren169: small to the K@D seemed normal|pg||

nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looks a bit happier now|pg||
nt|eamongall: panic kind of set in and the defence remained with its best source of tricks in tact at the end |pg||
nt|ppiglett: I'd say|pg||
nt|viren169: Np as 3@S was brought home safely!|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand now...|pg||
nt|mowen: for who?:)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is tough, can not stayman and show diamonds unless playing 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D by E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: they should reach game now!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2@H should go two down|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@c precision style, no hesitation from Norman showing longer suit...lucky him|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S looks like 9 or 10 as card lie|pg||
mb|d|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bridge correspondant of the Sunday Independant indicates Ireland can win the Senior Camrose this year |pg||
nt|viren169: Norman is on the go-faster stripes stuff!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trump lead would hold this to 6 or 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble slowed him down...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trump lead shouts out - heart shortage known in dummy and looking at heart length|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is Mr C offering odds?|pg||
nt|mowen: hmm, B'wood no help here with such length between them...and a stiff in 3 suits:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ciaran: the clublead has given declarer a quick re-entry to hand for a second heart ruff|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: absolutely|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hT|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mowen: I'd have xx and waited to see if pard found something useful...|pg||
mc|13|nt|ciaran: Declarer has done very well to get trumps right|pg||

mb|1D|nt|davidstern: The Japanese have it all to do here - being down 41 to a team of the calibre of Cayne is a tough ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Only 11:00am here so morning tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and sometimes 6 minor makes when opp languish in 3N|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|davidstern: One has to admire the Japanese SENIORS Team. They are a team of four having competed in the Yeh Cup and played four handed for nine days straight|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy 4@H game here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Rob.. the schedule got changed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd greatly favor slam investigation in imps because usually 5 minor does make huge gain/risk |pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidstern: The teams have agreed to play 4 x 10 as I understand it rather than 2 x15 and 2 x 10|pg||
nt|frankaus: the anti-discrimination people will get me but...... i'm not fond of minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: minor slams pay bonus in imps  that far outweigh the bonus in non-imps for 3N|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: originally was 5 x 10 boards, changed to 4 segments of 15,15,10,10 and then finally reduced to 4 segments of 10 bds|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: They had asked the director and I only assume he approved it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N was a brave attempt by N....... hard to think save with S hand..... and could have|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

nt|jcomyn: well a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|james_h: naturally :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another D game with thin values for 11|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agreed|pg||
nt|ianrei: hi all|pg||
nt|ciaran: Ireland gained 12 imps on the board where the defense can promote the trump J in both 2S and 3H |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Excellent H game E-W|pg||
nt|viren169: a possible swing there!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|jallerton: Welcome to Ian Reissmann,|pg||
nt|mowen: well the other room may find it tough too..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: could get overbord in 3nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: perhaps ur right - 1NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ian|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c game forcing I think|pg||
nt|mowen: 3nt by Garvey|pg||
nt|finch: NS have a 500 save against 4@S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5/4 e-w|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
nt|ciaran: There was a bigger score than 4H on offer there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke & O'Gorman checking the clock|pg||
nt|viren169: England are well behind in the match... maybe that is why we are seeing some interesting bidding going on?!?!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|jferg: although lavery show know after the rebid partner has 11 13|pg||
nt|jferg: too late now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||
nt|cindy: needed AKQJ of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: might get heart lead now i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: but shouldnt stop W from play @ss when he gets in|pg||
nt|jferg: still time for a spade switch from sime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonking wasn't that productive the last time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 80 min or so left|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D shows 6-4?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
nt|petepunt: too many values in @D is appears|pg||
nt|henryb: only three top losers (well 4 because can't set up a @c) but I expect two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Townsend giving a lot of thought to his lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
nt|henryb: I tould lead a trump with those @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not obvious to double with no trump trick in either hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob same effect as e can;t continue @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer a simple 3@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@D seems a little cowardly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: another slam missed!|pg||
nt|mowen: so down in a game when 6NT is decent|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
nt|viren169: another swing...|pg||
nt|mowen: denning never got to show his good values|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
nt|ppiglett: And with 6 good spades and heart sup|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|henryb: ten tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: whoops a googly in cricket terms|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: home free now|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've known worse "stoppers"|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkirl: still under pressure|pg||
nt|jallerton: often most of the time on the other side of the screen is taken up with explanations!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb: one of the points of a trump lead is that it suggests control of dummy's second suit. |pg||
nt|henryb: So partner will be less tempted to duck the @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: very true,  he did give it a lot of thought too.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|sharkirl: needs @S finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: the other point is to cut down on ruffs!|pg||
nt|petepunt: also no @H overcall by S so likely only 4 yet he jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: wont hold aQ@S surely ?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it is easy enough to see that the club suit comes in when we see all the cards. if not i think there is a fair case for starting with a small one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||
nt|ciaran: Doesn' look to be any losing option, but he has a choice whether to pay for @H or @C to break|pg||
nt|ciaran: Can he combine chances?|pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking for their money back... can only get better!|pg||
mc|10|nt|henryb: if he ruffs high, down he will go|pg||

nt|davidstern: Just to show values if nothing else|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chick: not me, because (1) I don't like 4 card overcalls, and (2) it has no value for taking up room|pg||

nt|mildredb: not to be picky, but it's 2 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@C normal game forcing jump shipf|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: they could catch them by the tinme of the autumn nationals :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shipf?    |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 8-to-5 on what little remains in the coffers -- that 1 imp won't come into play in the final result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S sort of like 4th suit forcing -- hoping partner held @S stopper|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i admit -  i stole 8-to-5 from an old Rat Pack bit [Sinatra, Martin, Davis]|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: you bid because you also hold 4 weak @S,,,,,, get something in JIC|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: What about 3@H?|pg||
nt|mowen: still if 5@D is the worst contract they reach they will do well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good competitive hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
nt|ciaran: 5H for E/W and looks like 4S will go one down|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gooke/Garvey's system is here: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2 down with perfect def - diamond ruffs and underleading H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3NT E/W way here...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
nt|henryb: not me. I pass a 15-17 1NT with East|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||

nt|ciaran: Yes indeed Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5@Hs has taken a turn for the better|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
nt|petepunt: neither can sing :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
nt|ciaran: East displays the magic dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Goo d new for dec at trick one|pg||
nt|chick: as do I ... balanced 8 usually isn't enough|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer... especially on a @H lead!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
nt|mowen: hard to see a swing on this|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
nt|henryb: and a balanced 8 opposite 15 often goes down in 2N|pg||
nt|chick: he does have a play for this, endplaying N|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree with pass,  especially as opps may come back in vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: ponder..ponder|pg||
nt|petepunt: small @D |pg||
nt|petepunt: what else can he play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
nt|petepunt: the end play looms now|pg||
nt|henryb: Ace and a @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: but may simply play S for q@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: gr8 hand |pg||
nt|henryb: he has 2@d, 3@c and 2@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
nt|eamongall: or was it always making |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|ianrei: should make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: amazing that so far in thios set of deals the score is 1-to-1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: Need a flat board to calm the nerves!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ciaran: The @DQ at trick one was revealing too|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true enough, but 1H could lose spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 40 imps could have changed hands|pg||
nt|cindy: marshall quit reading my mind|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: mm 23-6 good start for holders|pg||
nt|viren169: any ideas what that showed?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ciaran: I think declarer needs to take teh ruffing finesse in spades to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg: Murdoch goes for the only chance by rising with the @cQ, but it will probably cost another undertrick|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quality of @H suit probably stopped a 4@H response|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not to worry, shortcircuit after 12 seconds|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 5 was very int in O-room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I assure you all, there is a lot of thought going into this|pg||
nt|henryb: Wales' hope in the other match of interest is fading as EBU is ahead 20-4|pg||
nt|viren169: Some of the specs have said last two hands! Maybe they will change their minds!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|ciaran: surprising that W covered|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3rd is the realistic target for Wales THIS year|pg||
nt|chick: N's turn to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: exactly|pg||
nt|henryb: should have been thinking while Townsend thought.|pg||
nt|henryb: and be ready to play now|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ciaran: Even with the club wrong, N/S have 5C, 2S and 2H|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4333 8 count opposite strong NT ....hardly bids game |pg||
nt|eamongall: but maybe the opening bid in North tips the chances of making game in 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jferg: up with the heart ace and drive out the spade|pg||
nt|eamongall: however getting out the TONK tool for 2@Hs looks a good idea|pg||
nt|ciaran: cartainly can be made if you are in it and if you're going to play a 3 level contract..|pg||

nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Isn't the standard defense to this type of three suited opener "double and lead trump"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: auction on 8: 1@s - 2@d - 2N - P - 4@c - P - 4@h - P - 4@s - end|pg||
nt|eamongall: 140 in the bag but I predict  imps out for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he didn't want the extra 30|pg||
nt|viren169: We need it!|pg||
nt|viren169: we need more good boards!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very good slam here for N/S - no wasted values|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and Cooke should stroll into this as they are very practiced bidders|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C was 4+ here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
nt|petepunt: even 6@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes, that did happen. Immediate 4@h reply!|pg||
nt|ciaran: the commentators curse, eh, Eamon!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@D may agree @H here though|pg||
nt|mowen: very light opening even by the standards of this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman will be going backwards now at every opportunity!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
nt|mowen: the 2 over game force has allowed the club fit to be found|pg||
nt|viren169: Aceless 9 count? Not good in my book!|pg||
nt|mowen: but will be pass?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 for the road? this is high enough!|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to see 6@C could be right|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on this hand...|pg||
nt|mowen: add the AorQ of @Cs to east|pg||
nt|viren169: At least Norman didnt bid 3@C over 2D!|pg||
nt|mowen: I think he will bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
nt|viren169: With a void in pd suit and facing possibly only 4 card @C suit...pass is right!|pg||
nt|mowen: I am wrong again - some decision|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done Espen!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen has seen some of Norman's bid before!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mowen: why would east bid 3@C on 4cards?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bettertake that HA soon|pg||
nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Howard told Garvey "I've got king-jack"|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
nt|viren169: good start for defense... taking out the entry early!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: just bidding his shape out over 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: for what reason - to tell the oppo what to lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: N does best to pitch a heart...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
nt|ciaran: England in 4HX on the board where Ireland made 5HX|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: so maybe nom defence to beat it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the 3S bid should be forcing in that sequence|pg||
nt|cindy: no not 3S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade back and two off after one winning finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: that would make a grown man cry ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: not sure this line will succeed!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a lot of hands where W would want to try for game in case E has something of a fit, but if not he should be able to get out. after all it is not like he would ever want E ...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: how would you like the suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: The problem was the 1NT bid.  S not expecting a stiff heart in partner's hand|pg||

nt|petepunt: yes yea cup were doing well i think|pg||

nt|james_h: I dont doubt you for 1 sec Ciaran|pg||

nt|viren169: yes...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ew need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: another hand where EW may get a bit high.  11 opposite 11 may be 'opening bid opposite opening bid' but that doesn't mean game|pg||
nt|finch: (unless you are Meckwell)|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||

nt|jallerton: He has upgraded for the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Cooke said pass "denies spade support" but not totally sure|pg||
nt|viren169: dreaded 4441 hand ...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: they need to play 1Nx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H strikes me as a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|cindy: what is W piping up about ?|pg||
nt|ciaran: it certainly is a sound debut - this has not been a set for bidding pessimistically|pg||
nt|james_h: I like your style, but it means you are always on the limit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes, just 3 losers|pg||
nt|viren169: West seems to have been brushed aside looking at the best hand at the table...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is enuf work to do in 5d altho on this lay out 6 may roll in|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 5@d is more realistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i preecit that they will not get higher than 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: upgraded to first-class|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a disclosure issue here|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D with West's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: surely it shows more than 2 jacks|pg||
nt|viren169: dangerous dble by Brunner|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: might not even reach that|pg||
nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mowen: they might stop in 2M|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: With evey finesse right, looks like there are 11 tricks available in spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers that score is geting healthy|pg||
nt|eamongall: England by 90 against Scotland ...who started with 19 19 25 and were competitive this morning|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|viren169: dble will hold declarer to 5/6 tricks on good defense!|pg||
nt|ianrei: how about 3NT - they might bid that|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d - how strong is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now that any bit of candyfloss counts as a stop for nt purposes that may be true|pg||
nt|ianrei: surely 2H FSF?|pg||
nt|jallerton: they play strong @c but even so|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wales by 20 against North|pg||
nt|petepunt: correct|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to play 2N as t/o and al with most 8+ i believe|pg||
nt|petepunt: balance with most suitable 8+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: a lot of good players upgrade for playing strength - fine as long as your opponents know|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C was checkback...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy: and what about N and that 3D ?|pg||
nt|jferg: over here we bid if we have nothing otherwise passing suggests we want to penalise the opposition|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|cindy: so to stay out of trouble, you have to stay home|pg||
nt|ianrei: N/S can make 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = @c+@h|pg||
nt|ianrei: if D are lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: S can make 3NT, not N|pg||
nt|jallerton: unles W starts with @hQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so what if you have xxx xxxx xxx xxx|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..for E/W with half the points and a 9 card fit, 1@D is their limit|pg||
nt|viren169: If East cannot bid over 3@H best to let it go by West...|pg||
nt|sharkirl: carnage|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 5@D better|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead... trump back!|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: double is a support double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they cant unravel the clubs so tis would make if thatswhere they play|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C artificial of some form (probably forcing 2@D) - I guess 2@H is 5-4 majors invitational now|pg||
nt|finch: you were right, Steve|pg||
nt|viren169: lost their heart fit?!?!|pg||
nt|mowen: cunninly avoided the 4/4 heart fit with a 4-1 break|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: you bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cringe|pg||
nt|cindy: text your bids|pg||

nt|james_h: showing 3 card supp|pg||
nt|mowen: has to happen sometime|pg||

pc|h5|nt|viren169: Holland wishes he stayed in bed this morning!|pg||
nt|mowen: now will they make it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jallerton: h! 3 encouraging?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: just under 30 minutes remaining|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ianrei: Lester didn't like 3NT with J9xxx opposite a void|pg||
nt|lestergold: such reluctance to play 5 of aminor these days even in non match point scoring|pg||
nt|ianrei: now 9xxx opposite Q !|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jferg: say oppo open 12-14 nt and p x what do you do if oppo bid 2c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have trouble thirsting to play those methods. |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: would have to do a lot of drinking first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nothing that some acapulco gold couldn;t fix|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club king now for the sure set|pg||
nt|jferg: we lay arescue system called helvic where xx showsa five card suit and 2c shows c & dias etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Howard's utterly pointless double of hearts and u dont even get the proper lead|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@S is a decent spot|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: 4@H could have been on...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mowen: thin for 4@H with 12 opposite 9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ciaran: Intended as suit preference?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkirl: ??|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N by West is a possibility as pointed out by some specs|pg||
nt|sharkirl: operator?  did he not play the Jack?|pg||
nt|viren169: I expect hearts to be found in the other room!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok plan B, try to let this make|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine tricks now without even having to take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mowen: looks good|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petepunt: dbl should show a good hand with 3+ @S but needs great care|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg: at the other table North will play this in 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer is making an effort here... not sure about the defense!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: and go down I guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jallerton: in fact the hearts are blocked so probably OK|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait, i am confused, whose bidding are we talking about? i thought all this was prompted by cindy's comment about the 2H call, but now it seems we are duiscussing S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: playing 5@D undoubled in Open Room|pg||
nt|viren169: Now only 3 off!|pg||
nt|mowen: south is sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|eamongall: Garvey will be heading for home shortly losing just @DA |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|viren169: 6N found on the board 22!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cindy: i was talking about 2H|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: wit all the club discards can pobably afford the spade finesse for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg: so the swing will depend on whether he makes 5 or 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cindy: and 3D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: lavery needs a copy of a book by a scot|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: he might have done better to ruff in high and play trumps, but these are only overticks|pg||

nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 6@S on a non @D lead here...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
nt|mowen: another big hand - @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
nt|viren169: East will lead one of his aces if 6@D is reached!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|eamongall: about 21-9 but I will check|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
nt|mowen: west will be on lead to @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: on their way!|pg||
nt|viren169: tough for East to find it either|pg||
nt|mowen: the 4@C splinter might cost the slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: 4@D now!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps a make splinter in @Ds would be better|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 35-40 is 21-9|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: slam try 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|chick: serious 3N?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
nt|viren169: East may find a diamond now as neither N/S will cue 2nd round control in @D|pg||
nt|viren169: West!|pg||
nt|mowen: if South is going on he should cue @Ds to try to stop the lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmmmm... is Zia South?|pg||
nt|mowen: no Paul Denning is a solid citizen|pg||
nt|mowen: but temptation lurks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Denning is still thinking.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes think thats the name :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy as South know they are missing A of @H|pg||
nt|mowen: he should ask Espen what he intends to lead!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|viren169: He must have seen Espen had the @D ready!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he did|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree! bluff and counter bluff! |pg||
nt|mowen: so a good stop|pg||
nt|viren169: I would loved to have seen the 5@D bid!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|viren169: I could be a Euro up or down depeneding on next trick!|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|james_h: terry must unblock|pg||
nt|jallerton: catching up, not playing a speedball!|pg||
nt|viren169: that would make it extremely difficult for West!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulg: the upside for declarer is that he knows that this will be the same everywhere|pg||
nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
nt|mowen: mostly with limited high cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and no side winners to discard heart losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry MUST have unblocked otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: comfort break|pg||
nt|eamongall: that 13 imps translates to 3 VP in this case ...18-12 now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: if it stays that way then England take a 6VP lead into final match|pg||
nt|eamongall: England remain 90 imps ahead of scotland |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: all back and play resuming|pg||
nt|mowen: needing miracles I gather|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|viren169: We had some specs earlier on wondering what country EBU were...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
nt|mowen: another possible slam|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
nt|viren169: Some thought it was in the EU!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
nt|eamongall: he is not going to get any help in clubs so 3@Ss it is|pg||
nt|eamongall: and will be one off in about 17 seconds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, commentator's curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
nt|petepunt: may struggle to 6@C now|pg||
nt|viren169: with it's own currency... know as EBU vouchers!|pg||
nt|viren169: some of you might have traded in that currency before!|pg||
nt|viren169: almost as strong as the Euro|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
nt|chick: excellent contract if they find it|pg||
nt|mowen: poor effort by Brunner/Holland to play 4@S with 7 on a finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
nt|eamongall: if they get the bidding finished|pg||
mb|4S|an|k/c|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
nt|viren169: Is 4@C splinter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I think O'Gorman expected 3+ clubs opposite|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D will save a few imps|pg||
nt|mowen: don't know but should encourage south|pg||
nt|viren169: North will go on with those aces!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
nt|chick: scary though, will all those losers staring at you|pg||
nt|viren169: singleton x not good... |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d lead is a good start for the defence.  What's the best line?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not my fault those guys did not agree their defence to Unusual NT overcalls|pg||
nt|viren169: void good...|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S seems cowardly - why not 4@H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it's not your fault Cooke & Garvey couldn't bid 6@h earlier!|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
nt|viren169: S wont play N for A of @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 6 for sure... and a small chance for 7...|pg||
mb|6S|nt|paulg: true|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway 5 tricks off this so dow ntwo|pg||
nt|eamongall: two|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and cooke could have bid 6@Hs ..they just never started|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
nt|viren169: not a particularly good 7... on the odds|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops now we could see down a lot|pg||
nt|mowen: not optimum|pg||
nt|ciaran: Club to Q now|pg||
nt|viren169: but if N has a voild @C like he has advertised... he must have K of @D!|pg||
nt|mowen: specs are saying 4@C was key card ask which explains 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: Ah...........|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ciaran: This will make for 5 imps to England|pg||
nt|ianrei: Nice play by North|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: If N ducks, E can stop the ruff by crossing and taking a @h finesse - not necessary in 4@c|pg||
nt|ianrei: too many D forces allow 5S tricks, 2C and a H|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer could hope to elope all 3 small trumps in hand but would need defensive help|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 15 minutes left, 2 and a half boards to play|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - short entries for that|pg||
nt|jallerton: so if @h at trick 2, defence should play @h back|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: still thinking of !4S hand i suspect |pg||
nt|mowen: Denning will make this quickly|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|finch: I think the @H2 at trick 1 must have been count, Cooke could see no future in a club switch if declarer had four diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: A swing here... the wrong way!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ianrei: unlucky to be only worth an overtrick|pg||
nt|petepunt: may still be too many with @D break|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jallerton: as it is dec is play for 3-3 @s - perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|petepunt: but k@S is right now|pg||
nt|petepunt: W must hold k@S on bidding after his pass|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: I'm not really taking sides!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mowen: England lost it in the open room|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe not the wrong way :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||

nt|lestergold: well mayeb just as well the thin maybe anorexic game wasnt bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West was playing a 14-16 point 1NT at the other table, so East made a game try, his partner not accepting.|pg||
nt|jallerton: A great result for Wales in other room|pg||

nt|lestergold: well e/w have excellent save in hearts against n/s spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: doube fit territory always measn both sides can make lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ianrei: Not a happy choice of X of 4S by East in the other room|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: daffydd is prounced DAVith for our transatlantic friends. :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our deliberately anonymous operator, good work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hard to bid in most natural systems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaastrous|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A trump lead solved the problem in that suit and declarer soon had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If 2@s shows specifically the red suits, that makes it easier to bid on as East|pg||
nt|viren169: Staraight forward 4@H now... not what England want to see!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cindy: i have to bid something with N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the sponsors, commentators and spectators who laughed at our jokes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this double is presumably conventional|pg||
nt|jferg: no pen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H followed by 4D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Board was flat in 7@H in the Wales - Scotland match I believe|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach a thin 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: another fairly gentle game here, should be a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: why would W pass then ?|pg||
nt|jferg: and lavery will xx to show a five card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator says double is penalty|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think E should get this right anyway|pg||
nt|eamongall: hmmm silence is golden ...I have mopped the floor ..rescued the boiling over ham and made a cup of tea since my last comment |pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: a bid that would not occur to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double should show a minor or 4M, 5m hand|pg||
nt|jferg: prefers poker|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C now|pg||
nt|james_h: and they are on the road|pg||
nt|lestergold: now eastmust kbnow that his hand is not suitable for defending|pg||
nt|finch: this will turn into a very close match|pg||
nt|eamongall: its probably because we have loads of Irish commentators driven to silence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, you didn't miss much!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or russian roulette with FIVE chambers loaded|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N shows good raise to 3@h :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i can deal with 2S|pg||
nt|paulg: this looks easier to play than 2@h|pg||
nt|cindy: i see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good judgement by DFenning|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the kilkl point of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: 3C would have gotten hammered, no doubt|pg||
nt|james_h: terry might show the Hq here|pg||
nt|eamongall: However I first hit this earth in Mill Hill London so my team is leading |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: isn't all that the wife's job anyway?|pg||
nt|mowen: not very interesting|pg||
nt|viren169: flat board... next... time running out for England.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ciaran: sorry - EBU - NI match was the one where 7@H was reached at both tables - well done|pg||
nt|mowen: flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: The diamond blockage should mean this fails|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 9 min on the clock|pg||
nt|jallerton: @h 3-3 are a good start for declarer though|pg||
nt|jallerton: should N duck the first trick if dummy plays J?|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like this new country EBU has done very well on its 1st attempt!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: not a good start for defense...|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5H was going -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least east /west havent found a foolish double |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|petepunt: with IRE being thumped it could be vwery interesting 2morrow, Scot back in picture now too|pg||
nt|ianrei: he cat setup 9 tricks - can't enjoy them though|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: prefer 5C there from S|pg||
nt|ianrei: S disappointed at dummy|pg||
nt|ianrei: was it really worth 3S ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: oh well flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gives a better chance of reaching 7 on this layout alright|pg||
nt|james_h: Peter Goodman suggests 5nt to show the 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|viren169: problem either min is best on this bidding seq...|pg||
nt|mowen: not a good result for the selectors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||

nt|ciaran: Lead had changed hands in this match with every board completed in the past few minutes.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like EBU will extend their lead here|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have seen Cooke deep in thought before ...but I could not claim as I was not 100% certain I had the line |pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking where they can buy some of these EBU vouchers!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ciaran: In other matches, England were 46-0 up against Scotland last time I checked|pg||
nt|chick: if he can manage to hold this to -1, will be a push, but that will take some defense lapses|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Gold now asking meaning of 2NT|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ciaran: Usually don't show voids in partner's first is suit thoug, so may expect void in a minor?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ciaran: Final score for the first half of that match 57-0 I'm told.  |pg||
nt|jallerton: another 16 boards in each of these matches this afternoon|pg||
nt|ciaran: Anyone know how Wales - NI is going?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Garvey doesn't look confident of making this|pg||
nt|brolucius: It could hardly be natural, facing a one-level overcall and on a passed hand. You would need around 13 points at least for such a bid. More, probably.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|paulg: that diamond switch concedes an additional IMP|pg||

nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: selway plays too fast|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim|pg||
pc|sT|nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this should be 1 off for a few IMPs to Ireland|pg||
nt|james_h: you get the feeling that NS have their tails up going for all the part scores with gusto|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
nt|jallerton: Next session starts at 12.25GMT, 18 minutes from now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
nt|petepunt: was a strange pass with a good 12 by TT. ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
mc|8|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
