mb|1C|nt|othered1: Here, getting away for 100 isn't a bad result for NS in the closed room|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Getting to @D EW isn't necessarily easy, especially if west just overcalls (see closed room) rather than making a 2-suited bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but now we have a different scenario|pg||
nt|othered1: Would you get out while yoiu can with the west hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D -why not?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i would pass with a singleton club|pg||
nt|othered1: Very tough call for west who could be cold for anything from 2@C to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: or could be down at low levels|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: If you bid 2@D with west hand (forcing or not?) do you plan to rebid?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: passing may be right, but you would not fancy putting the West hand down in a contract of 2@C |pg||

nt|mdgraham: North is certainly not backward in coming forward  |pg||
nt|hedyg: Kilani could have XX 2@C X to show a high honor in @c|pg||
nt|othered1: The good pointed suit positions should let this come home.  But @C lead and passive defense thereafter will give declarer some concerns|pg||

mb|2H|an|spades|nt|oliv: might find the @h or @c defense now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may be tempted here|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|othered1: there's a transfer after a 1N overcall, even if it doesn't show a strong balanced hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 2@s should show 3+ cards here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S makes if you guess diamonds|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: you probably should on a restricted choice basis|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: if you play S for 3 cards in @D he is favorite to have the king though|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3:2 favorite|pg||
nt|oliv: I agree with irwinbo, seems a restricted choice to me|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But when the 10 appears it's different|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: The more I see of this Raptor 1Nt, the more I like it.  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer sandwich NT?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: but this isn't a sandwich 1NT, it's an overcall|pg||
nt|oliv: the important point, Hedy is that N playing 10 or J of @d could be singleton|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In this case it can't, Ollie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will give South 14 cards|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already promised 9 cards in hearts and clubs and showed one spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have 2 or 3 @ds depending on whether he has 5 or 6 @cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|irwinbo: in the other room, n-s never bid  but the wisdom of saving at the 6 level after you have pushed the  opponents to the 5 level escapes me though it sure does work here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if North has two, the play of the 10 could be from J10 or K10. With J10 he has a choice of which card to play, with K10 he has a restricted choice. Therefore it's correct play ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Do we expect 6@S to be down?|pg||
nt|othered1: Slam down?. Guess west eventually played north for K10 x (x) in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a problem in diamonds, thogh|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|oliv: yes actually declarant didn't do anything foolish|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he tried to endplay him @c but had no more trumps at the time and N still had a @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliv: he just guessed wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: They'll also get to slam here, east just has to make a strong move and west's @H void will go to 6|pg||
mb|6S|nt|hedyg: 5@H by E will ask for @H stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Best line must be to cash just 2 rounds of trumps, then switch to clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: cant be bothered with questions :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Then you can afford a diamond loser as it is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: stand not upon the order of thy going, but go at once  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see which line Romain adopts|pg||
nt|oliv: 6@s seems good bridge to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H was for free|pg||
nt|oliv: you may miss 7 though|pg||
nt|othered1: That 4-0 @S break will slow play down|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H by east, showing 5th round control?|pg||
nt|oliv: do you think declarer should test @c first ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, asking pd for @H control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Martin Schaltz suggested 2 rounds of trumps only, then clubs. I agree, his line is superior|pg||
nt|dburn: why would one bother with a second round of trumps?|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S might ask for control, but to me 5@H is a strong @S raise with @H control (at 5-level bids need to be specific)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't have to, right, but no harm done|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: yes sry you are right, i meant 5@s|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|oliv: I 'm thinking about dummy reversal|pg||
nt|dburn: you would do considerable harm if North began with the queen of clubs instead of the three|pg||
nt|dburn: since he would play a third trump on winning one of his club tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's turn our attention to clubs right now then|pg||
nt|oliv: I don't agree with the endplay in the other room...|pg||
nt|oliv: you should be able to read the count in @hs|pg||
nt|oliv: but playing is dangerous too...|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|oliv: instead of J of @c and @c|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: with low @H lead from north, endplay in other room doomed|pg||
nt|oliv: yep so just cash your minor trinks you know it will work|pg||

nt|hedyg: J@D*|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|othered1: That almost can't be the right play in @D |pg||
nt|oliv: any way, if you are sure N has 4 @c, you should end with A of @d and @d|pg||
