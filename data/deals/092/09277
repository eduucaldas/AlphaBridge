nt|marlowepi: it will do until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|raidouille: Chaugny - Puillet are playing a natural system|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello from Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi John and Ralf|pg||

nt|mariner1: Hi Roland, David, Joe and all|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see if they can do it again|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: this time a bad partial contract in @H for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Here South needs a @D-ruff in dummy to make 4 @S - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need help here,  these are 4 players I do not know |pg||
nt|raidouille: French style :)|pg||
nt|voldenuit: goulash hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will play 3NT probably|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well I would hate to play in 1H with this lot|pg||
nt|copeyj: bjr a tous|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Salut Simon|pg||
nt|jujux: Combien la France a t elle marqué au Round 9 romain ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Aha thanks :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N here showing both minors|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi David, Rob, folks.|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|col3435: I'll have to check that ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello again all |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: loos like 3NT here|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hi eveyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: precision 1@C and maximum negative |pg||
nt|yuval10: already starting with a bang, 6@h can be made here|pg||
nt|yuval10: with a restricted choice in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hi again|pg||
nt|jujux: Salut Simon|pg||
nt|voldenuit: salut :) |pg||
nt|copeyj: Operator - you have missed North's original pass|pg||
nt|werge: Cela chute - 4 @H en Sud|pg||
nt|mariner1: E did not open 1@D I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome all to more white house exploits|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5@c or even 6@c|pg||
nt|april7: they play precision?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2NT is 7+ without ace |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is a rather good slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but now no chance of getting there  S certainly did not stint on his pre-empt|pg||
nt|bobholl: can is the rigth word|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We're starting from scratch, no worries|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my, either we missed a pass or we're running into some Highly Unusual Methods here.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator I think you missed a pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting board to start with....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all. let's hope we will have a nice match.|pg||
nt|ady: no names of players|pg||
nt|copeyj: Salut Julien, Hans, Aymeric :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: et bjr à Romain|pg||
nt|voldenuit: ils se sont trompés à 90°|pg||
nt|jujux: operator, i think u probably missed a pass :)|pg||
nt|arthurking: Bonjour tout le monde|pg||
nt|copeyj: oui|pg||
nt|jujux: Oh romain @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: bjr Romain|pg||
nt|voldenuit: salut romain :) |pg||
nt|werge: Undo svp|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@C = 300 c'est pas mal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjy: yes they do|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S may land too high here.|pg||
nt|werge: Bad idea - South must be declarer in 3 NT|pg||
nt|raidouille: yes but it would be in a regular hand |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H 4C then what?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely worth it after 1@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c denies @s control, so 4@d = i have @d and @s control, otherwise i bid 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: Then play a big club or other system that has a non-game forcing forcing opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a rather good 4 @S here |pg||
nt|ady: this should be h eld to around 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: is that better?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is round 17 out of 23|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Dan, folks.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hey joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|werge: But on a @D-lead, you go down, Best play must be taking the Ace, then @C Ace - and 3 riounds of @H...?!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yesterday you told about a very conventional system. I think this pair is NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes it is|pg||
nt|werge: - but not this time...|pg||
nt|werge: North mus be declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one can only conclude from the French methods--2D is a GF while 2C is not quite GF--that the French bridge players get about twice as many rock-crusher hands as the rest of the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you can also make 6nt on W, but 6@h will go down on a @d lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so u have a singleton but it is an A so...|pg||
nt|werge: 500 - nice start...|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks as 4@s is the only game EW can make, considering the @c ruff that NS will get|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: "walk the dog" hand it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: -did I say that?|pg||
nt|werge: For me, 3 NT is a normal bid with the East-hand|pg||
nt|cindy: N not interest in slam since knows missing 2 aces but|pg||
nt|cindy: so does S think N has a balanced hand ?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: I wld bid 4NT with north hand which for me wld be to play |pg||
nt|raidouille: agree with you aymeric|pg||
nt|jcomyn: roland where do we get results - cant find them on Google|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, all academic now|pg||
nt|bobholl: without a @S lead you can misguess @H but they won't misfguess|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wouldn't dream of opening 2NT - distorts your hand and makes it far too likely you will miss a slam in one of your suits.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi all, btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|col3435: I think this pair played, but we certainly don't have the full team here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: France is 4th and Netherlands blue 8th|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fairly straightfoward hand to start us off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Israel U25 is leading the event currently|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would classically show pretty much what North has got, so South can go to the three level with a nine-card fit |pg||
nt|baldfriede: But pulled in the reins just in time.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North has no real reason to go on, so they have judges well|pg||
nt|werge: But best lead is 7 ot 8! of @D|pg||
nt|werge: or 8|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3Nt is forcing now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: so in this "natural system", on strong hands nobody starts bidding naturally until the 4-level ....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes what's the hurry?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ends one way or the other in 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, thanks.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT makes also|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek came close this year in the dutch "meesterklasse", loosing in the semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and he won the meesterklasse pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is impressive for U25 |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|othered1: True, but when my partner opens 2N and I hold xx, Kx, xxxxxx, xxx, I don't want to have to allow for a playable grand slam.  North's hand is just too good for suit play to get ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right into balanced hand structure|pg||
nt|mariner1: continued @H best defense|pg||
nt|santyclz: This gives him a chance to take the failing @d finesse.|pg||
nt|ady: diamond fall well   but hard to keep control of trumps after that|pg||
nt|yuval10: *4@h , that was|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@H wasn't MF (1@H relay)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: For up to date results and pictures: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63|pg||
nt|marlowepi: les spectateurs francophones sont invites a poser leurs questions ou commentaires en francais s'ils veulent|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: South must shift to @H, when he gets the @C Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff a @D in his hand you mean|pg||
nt|tomi2: west has really 7 spades? thought this is a junior tournament :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: is that our best spot?|pg||
nt|raidouille: wow|pg||
nt|voldenuit: claire has passed she isn't sure if 4@d is trans |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i'm guessing as 2@H would be a neg 2N shows a @H positive|pg||
nt|cindy: no but it makes|pg||
nt|voldenuit: but fortunately @h are 2/2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: just need to untangle it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: which makes me wonder why norht didnt support earlier|pg||
nt|raidouille: 2NT is positive without aces and balanced|pg||
nt|cindy: 4D must have been a transfer   why would N pass 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: system notes won't become a best-seller on the basis of this auction|pg||
nt|werge: The most polite I can be to Norths bidding is to say: I do´nt know their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Sandie :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: give operator a moment,  we will get the names up |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: arent the names up yet? sorry for the problems we uploaded wrong boards.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: Now he is home, clubs are behaving well|pg||
nt|chick: dangerous play by W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or @DJ!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am sure operator will give them as soon as he has a moment.|pg||
nt|voldenuit: on a @s lead it's down |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he should ruff a @D as odds are the 1N opener has A@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can  only guess that s didn't have a weak 2 in @ds available.|pg||
nt|sybarra: names are not up to us,  need to click and display to us |pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: i dare to predict they will reach 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And I dare to predict, that West might lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a contract you wouldn't expect in a junior tournament|pg||
nt|ady: finesses laying well   clubs 3-3  so defenders cannot take more than 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, but timing is important here.|pg||
nt|gips: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: P;ushy, but making 3N to start out.  Actually figures to make 4 if west takes the @S finesse|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|werge: South could have half a million @s´s|pg||
nt|copeyj: Must be gazzili style with 1@S being kaplan inversion (0-4@S)?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: easy start|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an unusal lead given the auction |pg||
nt|meikever: Results after round 14, and everything else you want to know: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: Makes sense if 2@C artificial (whether 1@S was natural or forcing NT replacement), then 3@D would show very good red  hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: but could go down on @H swich after @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on now - is, that they are telling E/W what they have...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know what they told..  cant read what North wrote down..|pg||
nt|bobholl: now show your own misbidding :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy theres an aggressive start|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: the @C jack is onside here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: 8 tricks, I regret|pg||
nt|ady: now hearts best|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi John,    and yes here we go!|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit pesky that trumps are 3/1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|werge: If South bids a so-called Viod-wood, West might find the lead!|pg||
nt|werge: Void-wood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think North is relaying|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but a friendly one-level contract is fair for warm-up in this event|pg||
nt|werge: But North mighy ytak 11 easy tricks - loosing the 2 @H-tricks only|pg||
nt|werge: might take|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: these hands are one of the problems with strong nt|pg||
nt|arthurking: On a fait 16 contre la republique Che. , une bonne euipe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi joe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|werge: I would discard the @S 9 here|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|werge: Best card from South next seems to e te @H 7|pg||
nt|werge: be the|pg||
nt|april7: each @H is ok|pg||
nt|werge: With transfers yes - but the transfer occured too late...|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find q of @S doesnt he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can cross the hand out now |pg||
nt|werge: No he can cross-ruff, when he discards a @C from the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again on perhaps being forced to play the @S right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are perhaps slightly fortunate that any heart ruff comes with the ace of trumps |pg||
nt|baldfriede: One can hardly blame East for leading @s though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are cracking me up Marshall.....|pg||
nt|voldenuit: she has to play @h now |pg||
nt|sybarra: best the Q?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: aymeric's "nom de clavier" is the title of a fine novella by Antoine de St. Exupery|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but with D there should be enough|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi again|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: will do the trick it seems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gips: it looks like the light opening bid of aldo paparo let a very good score, even if a little bit lucky, for italians|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like EW plays Upside-down count|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hey john|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: 2 means can stand return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best percentage play is one of two finesses but with 2-1 in @c he can have a discard so there is a choise with a @d lead|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a bit to do here, but things are friendly and 5 is possible, due to great @H pips|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, agreed.|pg||
nt|mariner1: many would Open N too|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Adam, Marshall.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: 7 rounds of bidding and only 5@c!|pg||
nt|voldenuit: :) well done claire :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still has to be careful|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very |pg||
nt|santyclz: Off to a quiet start.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|werge: No - for sure a normal lead|pg||
nt|ady: can actually end play North for 12 tricks  unles he discard AKQ diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice try by East, but declarer didn't buy into it|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is only the heartfinesse remaining now...|pg||
nt|yuval10: Netherlands Red U-25 are currently 5th, and Norway 14th|pg||
nt|yuval10: Norway is only 10 VP's behind 4th place France, and the play in the final-four|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahalim: right, maybe they're not fully awake yet :)|pg||
nt|meikever: Results, bulletin, info and pictures on: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|mariner1: especially precision pairs with 2@C|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is a close rase for the final 4|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: nice to hold the j of clubs if that @D had been held up |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if hts had been 2/1 would be down now |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2/2 rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the appearance of the J, suggests otherwise|pg||
nt|meikever: for the results, vugraph schedule, forum, pictures and all the info: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|col3435: yes, if you didn't have the @cJ you'd better win the first trick with the @sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel leads with 264, then comes Italy 255, Sweden 254 and France U-25  251|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: we have 6 rounds with 10 boards each today. we play a compleate round robin with 24 teams that is 23 rounds in the next 4 days|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: plenty of tricks now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why didn't N unblock the heart?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: well that made it easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's a nice surprise for North|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to hear this post mortem?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi John.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|voldenuit: @s ruff @d and a discard @h |pg||
nt|raidouille: @s ruff and @h discard on @d|pg||
pc|s8|nt|werge: They should have taken 5 runds - and bid 7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@C showed 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@H was rkc, and then it ended|pg||
nt|xenya: well this doesn't look too convincing to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: west thought long and hard about his bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: first 4 play semifinals and finals friday. so its a long trip|pg||
nt|jujux: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry players were a bit late i'll update the namen|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: I don't agree, E has no entries ... if spades do set up, he won't get to cash them|pg||

nt|sybarra: info from a spec |pg||

nt|sybarra: some scary play, but it worked |pg||
nt|baardolav: Stuurman had no trouble here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not sur[prising israel lead - they are fiercely aggressive |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: nice hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|werge: The slow @D 7 is Wests own fault - he ca take 2 minutes before taking the @C Ace!|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a push,  never need to apologize for that |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C= great hand or weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, East got a trump trick now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: when he played @D8|pg||

nt|jcomyn: 6-what?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: East doesn't appear to have many entries here either - and, looking at it, neither does West|pg||
nt|chick: I would have tried a heart lead on the last hand|pg||
nt|werge: I knew it would happen - now they will hardly find 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: pour les resultats et les infos|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C about limit here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry on the other team this is England u-20 only|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: sometimes a natural system is easier....|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure what I bid with S hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C might be wiser |pg||
nt|chick: doesn't work any better :)|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be the fashion to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an aul part-score 1NT probably|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know systems here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so very difficult to cope with|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like EW can make 6@D on very few hcp|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but that is just lucky|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes.... A@D onside and @d 2-2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never get there|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@S can make here, but missing the @S KQ probably won't be bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: my guess is 2@s on NS|pg||
nt|santyclz: What do we know about the systems (other than e-w aren't using a big @c system?)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here someone could get pumped too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: NS card says "'SAYC'"|pg||
nt|baardolav: Yes they are IMP makers|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: EW will do well to bid 5@D over NS's majors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Missing a chance here, unless South decides to chime in.|pg||
nt|arthurking: 4@s le contrat probable|pg||
nt|copeyj: oui|pg||
nt|ady: n/s limit 1@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Rob.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: even 5@d may be a bit of a challenge|pg||
nt|jcomyn: missing AQJ of trumps lol|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2N is probably an invitational+ hand with @S fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6nt available here (or 6@s).|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: Hi Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|othered1: west  has a flat hand with NT count, but unless 1@C isn't natural, why distort the hand when a siimple 1@S rebid is available?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think e/w got the big swing per operator|pg||
nt|raidouille: no drury ?|pg||
nt|werge: No,pls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sikora  with a   k|pg||
nt|ady: looks like you are right Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: east seems bemused by the redouble, i can see West's hand so i am rather bemused aswell|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL works here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any x with w opposite a passed pd?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and south has junk|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is off 500 actually|pg||
mb|d|nt|werge: Godd bidding, both tables play the jump for pre-emptive|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for it Raymondt!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say "vince")|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SjoerT Brink always calls him Vinnie|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  but I am not so familiar with him to do that |pg||
nt|sybarra: is N thinking of bidding?  I doubt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: He is|pg||
nt|werge: Another to the toilet? We fall asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North is thinking..|pg||
nt|werge: Thinking of whom?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: of 6@S?|pg||
nt|ahalim: The @S Jxx makes this a good 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this round all nations, who send 2 or more teams to this event play against each other, like this match, to avoid this pairings in the later rounds of the round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: must admit that 2@C would not be my rebid with souths hand. 3334 and some kind of semi stop in spades, thats a normal 1NT bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes then N has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|tomi2: north might now misjudge his hand and go for some club contract expecting partner to be more unballanced and have no help in spades|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello Cornelia.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Alexandre Kilani|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Good|pg||
nt|chick: Are we having fun yet? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are the boys concentrating on their cards Sandie|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT can be beaten double-dummy, but i suspect that defence will find it quite hard to do|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@s isn't a normal Precision rebid, is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Merci|pg||
nt|werge: Funny 4 @S here - missing the top of the family|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very surprsing pass b W|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is unmakeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: good point Hans,  what was her name again?|pg||
nt|werge: He better only think of 5 @s|pg||
nt|werge: So they might bid a bad 7 @h now - and make it|pg||
nt|meikever: results from round 5: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=63|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course juniors didnt go to Holland to pass|pg||
nt|voldenuit: c'est sikora il me semble le nom d'est contre bessis volcker |pg||
nt|werge: Et 11 levées +/- une|pg||
nt|ady: sold for 200|pg||
nt|mariner1: well still the deadly 200|pg||
nt|baardolav: It is prbably ony 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: but 3@s can make|pg||
nt|le joker: hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: strong club fo;;owed by a few natural bids would have worked out fine there i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like the 3 nt call, and now to beat this |pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking back at the hand, i find it odd that E led a club from three small instead of the Q of spades--the latter seems automatic|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: passing 3@C would have shown a bette rhand than bidding 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi alex|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has a difficult decision as opener. Both 1D and 1NT have advantages and disadvantages. the hand is rather strong for 1NT with a good 5-card suit and so many aces, and also more ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oriented toward suit play, which argues for 1D. but 1NT could make it possible to reach a black-suit game that would otherwise be missed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: good guesser|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 7 tricks with best defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes DBL of 1@H looks right to me with W......|pg||
nt|mariner1: carries some danger though with the Vul vs NV position|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but it´s worth bidding, @H Queen is deciding |pg||
nt|baardolav: and spade 2-2?|pg||
nt|werge: PK|pg||
nt|werge: OK|pg||
nt|yuval10: yeah, i guess you X, and convert 3@h to 3@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hello alexandre|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Welc Alex :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no red-blooded junior will stay out of slam - whetreher it makes or not|pg||
nt|meikever: for results, ranking, info, pictures and bulletins: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: your son?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Juniors today are a *lot* more disciplined than when I was one.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another disadvantage of 1D is you are not well placed if partner responds 1S (unless you play a 2C rebid by opener is artificial and forcing, as in Kaplan-Sheinwold and other ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: methods)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: will anyone of you try 3@h on E?|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests 2@S bid took one cuebid away for north so he has to decide the final contract now, he will be surprised but not unhappy with this dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The 2NT re-opening is enterprising|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3nt E/W will make here, since @s favourably and @c too and @h split 4-4.|pg||
nt|ady: t his will come home |pg||
nt|gips: i am quite agree on the 1nt opening, with Qx and Kx it looks like the best part|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how many boards in a match?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s, 5@c, declarer needs then @d finesse to the J|pg||
nt|yuval10: and north need to find the very unlikely switch of the A@h in order to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: but N can see the only chance is a of @H|pg||
nt|arthurking: sur entame K de @d|pg||
nt|arthurking: il ne faut pas manier les @s en securite sinon on fait 1@d 2 atouts et ...|pg||
nt|arthurking: DX de @c sont placéss mais|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: a "non cue" |pg||
nt|sybarra: or help request?|pg||
nt|chick: it's not a good grand ... requires 3-3 hearts or the J to fall singleton|pg||
nt|raidouille: Indeed, a spec told me that 2@c is natural|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 2@s = or +1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|werge: On a @C-lead, there would be many tricks in a @s-contract - if your intermediats were better|pg||
nt|ady: all the n/s soft cards worthless in a diamond contract|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: south is a very promising 16 year old junior|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get carried away|pg||
nt|sybarra: seem to have found the brakes|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: action..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a very reasonable spade lead, holding so many diamonds. If E had the king of spades instead of the ace, this lead would gain a trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: 500 in your hand(s)|pg||
nt|xenya: not me Ralph|pg||
nt|werge: Sporty guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: or often called "last train"  (unusual at the 5 level) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think he wanted 6@S but was not sure..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North, ok back to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be "happy" to be in only 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra: is "back to 4 @S"  called a reverse??  (LOL)|pg||
nt|werge: reserve|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what if South gets an entry to dummy, he might take the @D hook?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am a bit surprised by 2@h. Certainly West's hand is worth more than that.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I just know that if I did it, the opponents would wake up, bid 4@H, and score 620|pg||
nt|chick: It was alerted, perhaps shows more than minimum|pg||
nt|werge: Jack to fall is no good = one down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or a good 7@d. Since all bids are alerted - who knows what they mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H, yes. But 7@D is excellent |pg||
nt|chick: yes, even that ... 3-3 hearts is necessary|pg||
nt|voldenuit: east has to overtake the queen of @c the 2nd trick |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and his dad is keeping an eye on you|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 2@D was probably an artificial game force|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hence 2NT is still forcing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjy: hmm not after this lead ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: a good spot, nevertheless|pg||
nt|werge: But yoy might make this by bringing in the @D-suit|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 2@S is 5@S and side 5-bagger. 2N asks.  Makes sense|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should have braked at 3NT though|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S might have been easier, as well as 3 nt |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this a ropey contract again|pg||
nt|sybarra: just close your eyes |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hop is about to pay for his 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trust mr Bessis|pg||
nt|le joker: i play in the french :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: doubling Thomas is usually not a good idea|pg||
nt|le joker: team*|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Felix Zimmermann from Germany|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant figure 2S must be some system we dont know about|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 5-5 17-18 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: Very precise, as it turns out|pg||
nt|mariner1: except the @D :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|april7: W will be happy to make 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Felix,  welcome |pg||
nt|400 volt: HI all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ill try and find out|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I am being told it shows 8-11 with e-card support.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Note that North has seen his partners' re-openings before |pg||
nt|baldfriede: 3-card support*|pg||
nt|chick: yes, a kib also tells me 8-11|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes 2@D was GF|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: oh well...see what happens when you lead pards suit?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@D is best I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure 3@H is right on that. Possibly transfer to hearts and then bid diamonds|pg||
nt|werge: You might fall even in 6 @H having a lay-down 7 @d|pg||
nt|chick: if you were in 7@H, how would you play the heart suit?|pg||
nt|gips: better to protect the sorter top honours|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now HA like a shot|pg||
nt|bobholl: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: cards on table, head in hands|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 8 if he ducks so still chance|pg||
nt|yuval10: when you don't know what to do after you win a trick, it might be better to duck it and let partner give you more information|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion S must play a low spade, so N can have a count.&1c, 3@s, 4@d anh singleton @h|pg||
nt|vincenzo: hi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Vincenzo.|pg||
nt|yuval10: E needs to switch to @d after he'll take the A@h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as N is about to find out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Landry Andrea|pg||
nt|raidouille: hi all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: incorrectly|pg||
nt|werge: No J x x by East or J x x x by West - what´s best?|pg||
nt|gips: shorter|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Not my kind of opening, to be honest. I am a bit old fashioned about 1nt openings.|pg||
nt|yuval10: there's some danger here....what if West bid 3NT with 6 cards @c ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Worse than that, they prevent e-w from being able to make anything.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: how much is 5@DXX+1 hmm.. 850?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no... 1000|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: that makes more sense|pg||
nt|santyclz: Low @h to the J or 7?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Landry and (Chanson de) Roland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|werge: But all you need in 7 is trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|ady: this will be over in a moment|pg||
nt|le joker: fast food ! :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah well done|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: two without the queen|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: good :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: welldone|pg||
pc|s6|nt|werge: Where are the loosers, when you ruff two @H´s in the East hand?|pg||
nt|werge: Winning libe is @S to dummy, @c-guess and @D-too |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: should sign off now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: 13 |pg||
nt|sybarra: now needs the @D cash and the ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: or club, @D, @D,  and sp |pg||
nt|gips: second reason, a bit more difficult for opps to bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: low club from North would be a tester|pg||
nt|chick: they should make this, so S's gamble didn't accomplish much|pg||
nt|meikever: results round 2 can be found on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer has to switch to @d now.|pg||
nt|chick: nice looking playing site :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will be worried about a 5-1 diamond split |pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hi pard|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: now defence cannot fail|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems to me given even a whiff of slam they are after it like greyhounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how I play from her  |pg||
nt|sybarra: duck this all around?|pg||
nt|yuval10: South don't know even about J@s, so it's quite a clear sign-off|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: Luckily enough it´s difficult to bid 7 - West could have the "other" red king|pg||
nt|ahalim: what will W discard on the @C's ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Guiseppe in the North's seat is Vincenzo's son|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep your eyes closed|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but down now on a club switch|pg||
nt|chick: S can see the diamond suit on the dummy, so he must attack clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But what other options did declarer have? He can't get rid of the @s losers and the @c loser anyway. I think trying the @d was his only chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to see how a club switch can cost here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yes, South does not know about K@H.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But if a @c lead is bad, is then the @d lead any better?|pg||
nt|othered1: South can make the low spot play, based on auction.  Tipping north to the @C card, perhaps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nope, going to prolong the agony.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baldfriede: This is not as easy as it looks at all. If @h are 5-1...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Indeed.|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
nt|baardolav: well defended|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a big disaster to get a plus score here for EW|pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: He seems to be home, loosing 1 @S, 1! D and 1 @C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: L´impasse polonnais|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ciao Vincenzo|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hello and welcome back :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: We seem to have had some glitch; I am sure Roland will explain what happened soon.|pg||
nt|meikever: You can find all the information about the tournament on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - with pictures of the vugraph tables!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: very well judged! With no help from S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: never happnes to me so I wouldnt know|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: This is his last chance...|pg||
nt|othered1: north knows the hand is making|pg||
nt|werge: If ruffed ny North, he must overtake and close his eyes for 2-2 in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: +420 NEXT!|pg||
nt|vincenzo: ciao Roland !|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Vincenzo|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: nicely arranged defense |pg||
nt|vincenzo: hi champions !|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though juniors generally sign contracts promising to bid whenever it is their turn, the 2H call by N was not well-advised with almost no values of any kind, even at this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vulnerability--in part because the call takes up no room, and also because it does not really serve a useful purpose|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe e didn't ruff the @s.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|werge: Plays better than he bids - only one down|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should safety-play diamonds - king first|pg||
nt|werge: So he must start @d with the K|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: need more that coffee I think |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I had it once before, so I know :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: at the other table for Roumania plays the individual silver medal in Beijing, Radu Nistor |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bob Holl|pg||
pc|cK|nt|werge: Bridge est un jeu facile...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 12 levees|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bjr à Olivier Bessis|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why the switch are you?|pg||
nt|col3435: evidently south didn't believe partner had so many clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|col3435: maybe it wasn't clear at trick three, but it probably should have been at the end|pg||
nt|col3435: they hadn't actually given anything away until this club discard|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a bloody mary |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this angel aint feared to thread anywhere|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently not |pg||
pc|h3|nt|dan_ehh: did Thomas really waste the beer card?|pg||
nt|le joker: nice start for France ! :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cindy: pretty rapid defense by e/w|pg||
pc|dT|mc|7|nt|werge: He knew - East could have all foru|pg||
nt|werge: four|pg||
pg||
