nt|vugrapha2: 4@S is a slim if any hope|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||

pc|c5|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: All four of these players were in Australia to compete in the Yeh Cup|pg||
