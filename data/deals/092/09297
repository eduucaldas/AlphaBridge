nt|Walddk2: South could have @SQ though|pg||
nt|othered1: Not clear that south isn't 7-5, but 5@C cue is a positive thing, if west's 4@H was taken as strong support of @D.  I'm not sure why it should be.|pg||
nt|othered1: North's 4@H rather|pg||
nt|ady: yes    he could    I think in that position as North if you think the spade is you only concern  you should bid the slam   sometimes partner has either QX   or even JX   which ...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Boian Halachev from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ppilot: hi all|pg||
nt|wwalter: hi Boian|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk South should produce one more bid - probably 3@H, partner's 3@C was free bid|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lestergold: nothing wrong with souths bid- everything wrong with north's accdeptance|pg||

nt|rhelle: nobody can make much|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 6d on the NS cards looks like a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: being endplayed for a vulnerable game hurts - especially when you could have avoided the endplay|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tweety1: EW!'s @h intervention will encourage N  for slam I believe.|pg||
nt|danilo1: dangerous Dble ... but will gain|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|santyclz: 5 or 7 hand, can they diagnose it?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Difficult to bid it, and off if K@d wrongsided.|pg||
nt|ppilot: dont think they will find clubs and if find at bad level|pg||
nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||
nt|danilo1: if so agressive both, Dble is even more dangerous|pg||
nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||
nt|ppilot: hard for popov now:)|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess so, 3@C would be also pass/corr ... thk enough to bid 3@C, after all, it is free bid|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: i must admit it does look like a competitive bid for the part score- how is south to know that it is anything other than that?|pg||

nt|santyclz: We might do some editting first.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: appears so|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rhelle: @d 2-2, @c finesse right ... no such a great slam :)|pg||
nt|daman: most of the Bulgarians play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: heading to 3 nt|pg||
nt|tweety1: strong club system is very common in Bulgaria I suppose.|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be a club system with that 1 @D opening |pg||
nt|mmmakela: my estimate is that 4xp with today's aggressive bidding happens maybe 1/200 deals about|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: no slam played by south due to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|ppilot: 5 clubs 4 SPADE|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess 4@S Dbled ... not probable West will get chance to mention @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even only be 11 tricks..|pg||
nt|daman: so they open any 11 point hand 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tweety1: 2 KC out anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, you need to ruff 2@s and 2@c ... and after 2 rounds of trumps you have only 3 trumps left|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h is an interesting bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: so only 1 loser - but also only 11 winners:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldfriede: Yes, @h ruff will set it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sensible spot|pg||
nt|tweety1: good judge by N this time:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n was fine too but dont blame north wanting top lay in dims|pg||
nt|daman: forced to rebid his 4 bagger :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: just in case there is a hole in one of the black suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: should really be a big takeout 3 @h|pg||
nt|daman: this contract will be tough to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 min won't fair but 3 nt has chance|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tweety1: needs to duck the 1st @s to make.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ppilot: as it can be seen luck is with the brave|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances....slim and none|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: and guess hearts|pg||
nt|tweety1: and also 2-4 leads are common too.|pg||
nt|rhelle: ouch ... why didn't south introduce his @d?|pg||
nt|rhelle: clearly didn't get the meaning of 3@h|pg||
nt|jbgood: strange he didnt want to play the 9 card trump fit..|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: not with 3-lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll declarer will have a high blood pressure momwent shortly when he leads a dim from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e will have at least a mini tank and then run the dim in any case|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: next time someone will lead their singleton holding Kx dims!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: but if North ducks 1 round of @h, he should get a fair way here|pg||
nt|daman: now return a @H and duck|pg||
nt|daman: then it is 2 down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tweety1: @h ace must be in S to make.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Garvey|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: if N has a 2 suiter - she would have bid the second duit directly - I think - so she must have @d also. Perhaps a redouble of 3 NT would have made it crearer to S|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I think you're right, Jon|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe South thought that 3@h just showed a very strong hand, and after 3@c a monster 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a XX over 3NT would clear it up|pg||
nt|rhelle: now North has blocked the @d suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: is this really how the @d suit has been played? The 6?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is not going to go well|pg||
nt|jbgood: depends on what team you are rooting for..|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes ... I am impartial, so I'm just looking from declarer's perspective|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I unserstand why. Is he going to try and cut down on @c ruffs by returning a trump, or trying to get declarer trump short?|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps he thinks that N is 6-4 in the blacks (as S may think too)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: asm soon as north shows sign of life south will drive there- i think this was lazy bidding bu south|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, it's all academic now. I fins South 2@h bid with 9 points in partner's suits very timid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mmmakela: 3 spades makes w right guesses|pg||

nt|jbgood: a question of cashing the spades|pg||
nt|daman: on a @C lead you need to find the @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: same in either contract|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have been confident of 4-card @S not to investigate|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess play 4c majs|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u have more time to explore in a heart contract not that declarer is likely t pick up enuf info to make the right guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4@h is bettear as you can make a few discovery plays if @H are 3-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well must have had a friendly defence in open room|pg||
nt|thegarve:  make the @S guess straight way in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4h you will discover that south has the doubleton heart and u may therefore play south for three spades|pg||
nt|thegarve:  you can discover that south has KQ@C and did not open the bidding|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a@d|pg||
nt|daman: a @C lead is the best|pg||
nt|lestergold: well jack of spades most likely to be placed on distributional considerations rather than as a high card placement|pg||
nt|lestergold: still all academical|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3-level I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: dont think so:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so they pass them because 1 @S could be even (7)8-12 maybe|pg||

nt|lestergold: pure guess |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the dim suit in dummy, there are limited defensive options|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: wouldnt the 2 be better then?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: they are obviously not playing udca|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|danilo1: safety is safety ... he does it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: probably because he was in dummy and that was the most convenient play|pg||

pc|d9|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||

nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||

nt|lestergold: belladonna had no problem- u know the story about thyem putting th queen in both hands|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|daman: but I.m sure you will tell us|pg||
nt|lestergold: he said it was impossible theyu both had the missing queen he knew it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One day of rest, how lucky we are|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can you stop North in time? I doubt it|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 4@S has 4 losers   but East first will need to a diamond  and later may still be in difficulty|pg||
mb|2D|an|forcing game|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  game-forcing relay|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: I think the only lead that may beat 4@S is a heart and North not playing the jack|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cindy: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: that they wont  make|pg||
nt|frankaus: key card should discover that they miss 2 and stay out of slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North can't be bothered|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: how can 4 be beat   N leads a diamond at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: oh  duh|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4 can bed beaten on a heart lead if North plays the 9|pg||
nt|frankaus: no X so 5 imps more to andrea|pg||
nt|ady: plays the king Cindy  and West returns a heart|pg||

nt|mariner1: conservative|pg||
nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||
nt|viren169: well deserved 3 imps!|pg||
nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||
nt|viren169: east pass by N|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||
nt|lestergold: however n/s have offered an alternative source of points also offered in closed room but accepted here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|3N|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 hearts a dim and two spades for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: Thank God nobody bet:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: unavoidable on this lead must go off|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jbgood: also tu BBO and Roland Wald for providing software and organizing live broadcasts for the enire world to enjoy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now will increrase thec kleasd|pg||
nt|daman: I like DOPI for Kings over interference of my 2@C openers     that way we can catch the opps speeding from time to time and still get to our normal contract if we don't|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: or even pass|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to tickle 3d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bit over the top |pg||
nt|mariner1: W finds a lead right into the Jaws as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few more in in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tickle would have certainly been my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW probably think they are ahead and are just protecting their lead|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ppilot: if they find club ruff =500|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse followed by a lot of tricks cashing and a claim for one off|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: -500 against part-score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: fair ebuf George|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant enuf|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: fair enuf|pg||
pc|d6|nt|viren169: a bit unlucky for E/W |pg||
nt|thegarve:  they wouldn't know that they are leading|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: Finally a big thank you to our kibs for their inputs - much appreciated! Hope you enjoyed|pg||
nt|daman: gotcha|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get a few imps for passing too|pg||
nt|daman: table presence tells you whether or not you think you are ahead in the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats also true Martin|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s3|nt|daman: @DQ in dummy would have been a keen disappointment|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: cards lying friendly for declarer  |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|frankaus: its not been a kind set to declarers - will that influence NS ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: can make 6 spades as well but will need the ruffing club finesse and diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cindy: S is gunshy|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: spec pointed out also 6NT   give up a club    and if the spades break then home   otherwise diamond finesse    probably 6NT the best   but only because the clubs are AQ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: S will picture 65 with N but where will she go?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he|pg||
nt|frankaus: he sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea is a surname|pg||
nt|ady: if South knew of the J@C  would be encouraged to bid on|pg||

nt|lestergold: well theyhabvnt and no swing|pg||
nt|daman: and Bravo Silvia our very fine vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: the  3/1 ht brwak means they cant draw trumps establish all the spades in the end game they need to ruff the fifth spade and a dim in dummy but there would only be one trump left ...|pg||
