mb|p|nt|henryb: The south hand looks like my typical one. My partners claim that I pass more often than anyone they know|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The CR auction is to be recommended|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes. You feel you are a little too good for 3@D, but it's the practical bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: Not so thrilled about this auction ... |pg||
nt|henryb: you are a little worried that you ned to bid NT because you may have the only spade stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: E may think he should bid a little more|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's uncomfortable, but by now, are you not certain you are of @HAK?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partner has a spade stopper, diamonds - what else is left for the opening bid?|pg||
nt|henryb: no. and partner might have a stiff heart instead of a stiff club|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: he may need to hear @h cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: I wonder If they play 4@d as rkcb, it is hard to get a cue that he need|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@D. Then Molva can sign off in 4NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The CR auction is looking better and better.  I really think that East would be chasing moonbeams to go bidding here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After all, he hasn't exactly got great diamond support|pg||

nt|bjacobs: On the contrary, for this pair, it is one of their strong opening bids|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might you make 6@C on a heart lead?  Lacking an entry to dummy, you bang down @CA|pg||
nt|henryb: and if they play 9-12 1NT, I would but definitely open 1N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On a spade lead, you have losing options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what it got in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that the East hand isn't pretty, Henry, but I don't think you will find many who pass it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then it seems reasonable to go down - use the entry to take the club finesse|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Actually, on a heart lead, I suspect you go down as well ... on reflection, it's silly to play @CA|pg||
nt|henryb: I understand, Roland. But by my way of adding values, that hand comes to about 10 1/2 points|pg||
nt|arigun2: ew is playing 10-12 NT it is difficult to stop from molva's hand knowing partner has 13hcp at least with a 17 and 6 card suit againist balanced|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Hmm, I shouldn't have been lazy |pg||
nt|henryb: thats why I think it is well within the 10-12 1NT range|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Poor old declarer is tying himself in knots trying to work out the play.  It's certainly a puzzle|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But absolutely nothing is going to work, except peeking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: you can get close by using 6-4-2-1-1/3 points (that hand is 14 1/3) and subtracting 25% of the result (3.58)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|othered1: why not?|pg||
nt|me argent: 2 3 or 4@SS?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I like 4 but he may be worried that the double is a single suiter diamoinds and good hand maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: gotta get to game at least, so anything short of 4 doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: May also be worried about slam knowing short hearts opposite|pg||

nt|santyclz: 6 tricks in hand, no defense.|pg||

nt|mmmakela: in previous if patrner isn't short in dias they might well have 4 spades so why shd you bid over 2 spades as N|pg||
nt|chick: it's easy to focus on that gorgeous diamond suit (previous hand) and forget to look at the 7 losers in the other 3 suits|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|othered1: woinder if 3@S is weaker than pass, since west has shown 4@S with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||

nt|othered1: Yes, winning judgment by Cayne, in a position where Weinstein bid 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Heart pick will be crucial either finesse follows to make|pg||
nt|othered1: And south is essentially endplayed as declarer may need one more entry to dummy than he has available|pg||
