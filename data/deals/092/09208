nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: and the distractions many :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia, Markku.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any votes for 3 NT by S?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose Zmud with his 5 crd support had to bid 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes @S lead and continuation will force declarer to lose trump control|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: i think defence will prevail unless declarer can drop @CQ|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|othered1: Now Wiz is down, if NS get this right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A technical error by Seamon I think|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||

nt|garnetts: In isolation two finesses--but not this time --entries won't allow it |pg||
nt|viren169: still not out of the woods yet...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bets line is cask K@S A@C ruff one ruff a spades  then a club over ruff--with K@D restricted choice to drop the queen |pg||
pc|hK|nt|golfsquash: Declarer is still in control|pg||
nt|bobholl: calculated risk for game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|caitlin: with spades|pg||
nt|golfsquash: a spade before the trump?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No Board 18 shows result as -1, whereas it should be -5, John's estimate is correct|pg||
pc|h7|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to set up the clubs... but 2@H bid makes it likely that West has long clubs.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--but the main issue here will be edropping the stiff q@D--which after the over ruff with the K@D should happen|pg||

nt|viren169: sound openings is a good principle in 1st two positions.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: Anderson alerted 2C, don't know why|pg||
nt|viren169: could get into all sorts of problems now...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I  wouldn't play them--because it gives the oppo an extra string to their bow--you can bid the transfer suit for takeout and use dble to show a balanced hand--1NT a trick source--|pg||
nt|viren169: what about the advantages of using it... a lot of top players are using it now.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Serves NS right for not knowing their system--and you could argue that North has no reqason to bid 3@C--maybe 3@S |pg||
nt|viren169: best for North to pass before the red cards start appearing.|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view North must assume that South has a decent hand--in light of the pass with reasonable spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S checking opp CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: anyone agree with me I wouldnt dream of bidding on that W rubbish|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: good shot at trick 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: But North is simply bidding 3@C knowing that South might have misunderstood--this could be a director issue|pg||
nt|viren169: Game in spades is still unlikley opposite a decent hand, as South had passed 1@C.|pg||
