mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||

nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||

nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||

nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||

nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||

nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||

nt|othered1: I must leave for a bit.  Thanks all and bye!|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|xenya: well it makes now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||

nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||

nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|viren169: I think declarer played South for singleton honor or 2-2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|athene: it just means south can't play spades|pg||

nt|athene: but there are plenty of other things for the defence to play|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||

nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass of 2@d was the winner.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: 2@C was puppet stayman, so 2@D didn't deny a 4-card major, so east had to press on|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||

nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||

mb|2C|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||

nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead trump.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No problem|pg||

mb|4H|nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You win the second club, cash 1 high heart and play 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
mb|6C|nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c6|nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hedyg: E in CR bd 6@c over 2@H|pg||

nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no 20 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: (still)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3N or 4@S E/W way anyone?|pg||
nt|athene: now west will probably go 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: or, of course, 3nt :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||
nt|athene: most likely it will make four spades, two hearts, @CAK , @DA|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||
nt|athene: well, @CA lead beat 4@S as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: given the SOTM|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3N...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||
nt|cicus: no only 11 tricks without giving up a diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: reverse dummy plus squeeze against S dfoesn't works as there are no entries to the W hand|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not exactly a runaway match.|pg||
nt|viren169: any views about J2N?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was OK i think - west's hand was just too strong for a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: but of course we don't know exactly what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2NT was jacoby (3 @h were short but Soucasaux prefer to say was minimum)|pg||
nt|athene: yes ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: this auction's course will all depend on whether north finds a response to 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: good chance of  4@S here    would have to misguess both majors  to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: if E/W misguess both @h and @s (and this one they will) 4@s or @s is minus 1 otherwise...|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D rather tame   but west would be in at a higher level|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: another partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: W is a passed hand so surely can affort 3@d.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: last one. Thanks all. We will be back in about 15 min|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ady: but the non heart  lead  was surprising|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: This could go out with a bang.|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: may get N/S to bid 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: judging by board 10, it will stop a while after it should have done :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east, with 10 black cards, is entitled to hope for a fit somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north passed over 1@C??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but will be disappointed :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: 3 clubs now  should end the auction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: surely cant be thinking of bidding on   partner has shown some values in his void  and he has a light opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: but think 3 @c is the limit...|pg||
nt|ady: surely must be   otherwise Pinto cant compete    and his is not shy   |pg||
nt|viren169: diamonds lost now...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzkc: oops|pg||
nt|athene: but apart from only have 2-2 in his partner's suits, west's hand is actually quite suitable|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: Maybe Pessanha has lost his pass cards|pg||
nt|athene: *only having|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: And, in fact 6@ss can make.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Gave his pd a stiff @s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok. once again thx all. See u tomorrow at 15.15 london time|pg||
nt|athene: well, i know diamonds are a minor suit, but it's not actually illegal to bid those yet|pg||
nt|athene: soon it will be, no doubt|pg||
nt|athene: even 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: or 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - 7NT isn't making i don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: not yet... may be in the US!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|hK|nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
nt|athene: well, the opening lead solves one of declarer's problems|pg||
