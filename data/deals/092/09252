nt|ralfwil: bad defence! W has shown up with 8P|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South told North that.. |pg||
nt|werge: A very good 6 @c here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hello all. Let's hope we will see an interesting match. With these two teams being in it I have no doubt about it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all and welcome the the White House |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|april7: this time a bad partial contract in @H for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Here South needs a @D-ruff in dummy to make 4 @S - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need help here,  these are 4 players I do not know |pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5@c or even 6@c|pg||
nt|april7: they play precision?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzjy: yes they do|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|baldfriede: N/S may land too high here.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: a rather good 4 @S here |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|werge: But on a @D-lead, you go down, Best play must be taking the Ace, then @C Ace - and 3 riounds of @H...?!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yesterday you told about a very conventional system. I think this pair is NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes it is|pg||
nt|werge: - but not this time...|pg||
nt|werge: North mus be declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|werge: -did I say that?|pg||
nt|werge: For me, 3 NT is a normal bid with the East-hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: 2@s would classically show pretty much what North has got, so South can go to the three level with a nine-card fit |pg||
nt|baldfriede: But pulled in the reins just in time.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North has no real reason to go on, so they have judges well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek came close this year in the dutch "meesterklasse", loosing in the semi finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and he won the meesterklasse pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is impressive for U25 |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: South must shift to @H, when he gets the @C Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff a @D in his hand you mean|pg||
nt|tomi2: west has really 7 spades? thought this is a junior tournament :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|xenya: i dare to predict they will reach 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And I dare to predict, that West might lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a contract you wouldn't expect in a junior tournament|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: but could go down on @H swich after @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on now - is, that they are telling E/W what they have...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know what they told..  cant read what North wrote down..|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: 8 tricks, I regret|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|werge: If South bids a so-called Viod-wood, West might find the lead!|pg||
nt|werge: Void-wood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think North is relaying|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but a friendly one-level contract is fair for warm-up in this event|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: these hands are one of the problems with strong nt|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|werge: I would discard the @S 9 here|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|werge: Best card from South next seems to e te @H 7|pg||
nt|werge: be the|pg||
nt|april7: each @H is ok|pg||
nt|werge: With transfers yes - but the transfer occured too late...|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find q of @S doesnt he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can cross the hand out now |pg||
nt|werge: No he can cross-ruff, when he discards a @C from the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go again on perhaps being forced to play the @S right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS are perhaps slightly fortunate that any heart ruff comes with the ace of trumps |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|april7: 2 means can stand return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best percentage play is one of two finesses but with 2-1 in @c he can have a discard so there is a choise with a @d lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldfriede: Yes, agreed.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7 rounds of bidding and only 5@c!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ahalim: right, maybe they're not fully awake yet :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|tomi2: we have 6 rounds with 10 boards each today. we play a compleate round robin with 24 teams that is 23 rounds in the next 4 days|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that made it easy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there's a nice surprise for North|pg||

nt|werge: What a lucky 4 @H here|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough match,  only 1 imp the air so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you know any of the players Felix?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|400 volt: No, sorry :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a difficult lead, With a black lead 3@d is -1|pg||

mb|1N|nt|400 volt: maybe by seeing, but not more :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: gm all :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahalim: Hi Shirl|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@S unfortuntely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they should avoid 3N, but that won't be to hard..|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: hi Arifin:)  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Thomas|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Often defenders take the @D Ace, three @s-tricks - and finish with the 13th @S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: Here trick 11 comes from the weakest suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 8 tables..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4 @S was not the contract I expected :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: and ofcourse also 6 @H and 6  NT|pg||
nt|april7: doubleton K of @D|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 6 NT on at @c-lead - South is squeezed I´m sure, when West takes the 6th @H!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: scores at:  http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: My lead is @c10 from that suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: e/w will have to open the @D suit in time, @ST is dropping... ok not anymore|pg||
nt|chick: You can find all the information about the tournament on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl - with pictures of the vugraph tables!|pg||
mc|10|nt|werge: It seems to be the plys called - I just take my tricks|pg||

mb|1S|nt|werge: Slam???|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to get there |pg||
nt|sybarra: @C or nt?|pg||
nt|werge: - and guess the trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: ok no X|pg||
nt|400 volt: if the other table stays in 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 1 NT seems to be 3 down og a @H-lead|pg||
nt|werge: on a |pg||
nt|april7: another 6@S and 7 without a @H lead|pg||
nt|april7: sorry only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% slam, 12 tricks with @sK on side|pg||
nt|werge: A slam here - and E/W will have a giant-score|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess the clubs in either game |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: errr either slam |pg||
nt|sybarra: are we linked to other room? |pg||
nt|400 volt: something like  10 imps :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: but we'll only see the scores at the end of the session|pg||
nt|400 volt: they startet with the second last and last board of this table|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: 3 @C slamish |pg||
nt|tomi2: OR already finished 2 more boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: NS play precision but South didnt want to relay I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are gadgets, not sure I can explain accurately |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C, minor suit ask,  and 3 @H=4+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: exactly 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: otherwise 3@D, i have a 5(6) card minor|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 3@S was alerted as "to play" and not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: barrage like |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: other room has started with boards 19/20|pg||
nt|400 volt: we may see what the other room played in the first board here|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|werge: North´s jump must be due to the fact, that they play strong @C-system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: For standings:http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even a try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, it prevents south from showing his @D support. you can make 4@D|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzjy: http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||

nt|werge: Few loosers N/S - but not so many tricks either|pg||
nt|werge: But might give N/S 1 point|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  and of course 1 imp can be "killer"|pg||
nt|werge: Here it´s not about 1 point|pg||
nt|400 volt: but lost the plot later|pg||
nt|400 volt: 12 IMPs for the netherlands|pg||
nt|chick: a nice 3N here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning from Sweden|pg||
nt|werge: Morning "hinsidan"|pg||
nt|april7: if N doesn't bid after 1NT then W plays 1NT, but N could bid DONT and play perhaps 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a partscore in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S on?|pg||
nt|werge: It´s impossible to get less than 12 tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is fabulous venue btw |pg||
nt|sybarra: White House, in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|ahalim: ok they're still young and hopefully learn from their mistakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes, they are the unter 20 team, so they have 5 years or more as juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: U20's need to get back in the game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wessel, you need to shut dowm and reconnect to the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: or some other convention after NT|pg||
nt|xenya: questionable whether they will find the fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: will start next week |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @D from North, pls|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gerbrand, playing there now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they are playing at white house now|pg||
nt|400 volt: (4 @S X -4, as we might have expected)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @D might get E/W overboard|pg||
nt|meikever: next match on vugraph in 45 min is: Belgium - Netherlands Red U25 .. see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for the full playing schedule, articles and pictures|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: That West-hand is too strong to be a 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but difficult to find|pg||
nt|werge: So - 1430, next board|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is refurbished tennis facility (12+ courts) and a fabulous building, patio etc. ) perfect for the bridge tourney |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ok|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: will need Gerbrand to remind me of names,  but 2 gentlemen purchased the facility and tuned it into fine place it is (of course they are bridge players:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does W bid?  5 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East left to toilet..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be sick,  he has the good hand LOL|pg||
mb|d|nt|werge: Okay...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Ralf and Hans|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like 120|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy:  Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford,|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Gerbrand,  I just could not remember the names |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North telling SW, that East left|pg||
nt|werge: West can see his own @H-holding - so he knows, that Easts 4 @D is a big hand with self-made @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and does 5 @S say W has control of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tricky stuff |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think many of us "plain vanilla" types would bid 5 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: and Gerbrand, our operator|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: you are very aggressive Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does 5 !N ask for club control?|pg||
nt|werge: For Aces - 4 NT was not available|pg||
nt|sybarra: an told:   5@S good hand with spades, 5NT ace asking|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C sh be a 5-6 card suit - why not 3@C??|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we can probably refill our coffee's on this hand |pg||
nt|400 volt: why 3 @C? because you found your fit - I don't know what 2 @C after X is in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: "do we play TIC"",Tim asks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|werge: No - I just want to point out, that with so many intermediats + a good 5-card suit, you ar too strong|pg||
nt|werge: Service double - good for East to know...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  we have landed as they say |pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel U25 are title holders here and they are among the favorites in this event. Others will be Netherlands 1 (I think its red, so we will see them next match), France and Poland ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: imo|pg||
nt|400 volt: what is TIC?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: transfers in competition|pg||
nt|400 volt: ah :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Anyway - E/W landed fine|pg||
nt|april7: now NS missed 3@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: 1@D in third seat not unreasonable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|400 volt: obviously not :-)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Agreed.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to lead a heart, but nine tricks now |pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: well NS have 6 top tricks -- still a chance they will take them|pg||
nt|sybarra: take ace of @C,  and E claims,  (as long as no ruff)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: hey,  you are not that old Felix |pg||
nt|pelu: so they dont know the system??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: not a usual partnership no|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Tim Verbeek plays with danny Moolenaar, Stuurman is with Frank Visser|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: You mean 4 @S|pg||
nt|april7: on @S lead only 3|pg||
nt|werge: If you do´nt start with 3 x "S, 10 yricks are easy|pg||
nt|werge: 2 x @D|pg||
nt|april7: but they are experts and lead 3x@S|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Frank had job conflicts and could not play this event |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes, his new job started at.... march 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: take it or leave it offer|pg||
nt|sybarra: good timing to get a job,  but bad time for bridge events |pg||
pc|d2|nt|werge: 3 x @S|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Declarer will probably take them from the top.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|april7: but 3@D 1 down also ok|pg||

nt|sybarra: that might be one reason |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and they probably where out of inspiration|pg||
nt|tomi2: this board reminds me of a discussion we had in our team in beijing, does a passed hand have a GF-Fit raise available?|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of @Hs with that fiendly layout|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|400 volt: yes, 5 @H possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: best contract is pass now|pg||
nt|april7: what about  N? W is not afraid at all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: This should be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West: When I played 4crd M openings pd always has more fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: will they bid 4?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjy: 1N wasnt forcing but south bid 2@C anyway..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cue's start a force |pg||
nt|400 volt: in IMPs not impossible to bid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Or not after this multi opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there are two schools of thought about defending Multis - one, as here, is to wait until opener has defined and then double for take-out |pg||
nt|chick: EW could get to a very makeable 4@H, too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: I suppose it´s early in Holland....|pg||
nt|april7: what? S doesn't X???|pg||
nt|werge: Has´nt South paid his inscription!?!|pg||
nt|april7: no confidence in partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont you love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another is to double immediately with 13-16 or 20+ balancedish.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I see what you mean but he showed @h so 2@h had been Jacobyr without a @h control|pg||
nt|sybarra: very friendly layout,  can they make 4?  with the @D's not behaving well?|pg||
nt|400 volt: very passive by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: can't |pg||
nt|xenya: everything wrong for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East starts asking about the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: now "we" just have to make it |pg||
nt|tomi2: one teammate holding a very similar hand bid 2@S in this situation, that is normaly GF in their methods, intending to show a "verrry maximum hand" but to pass partners 3@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2NT would be invitational and require extras from partner for game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would have pushed |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahalim: and this is not so easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have no @S,  why not?|pg||
nt|pelu: he had placed a @H in the @D-suit :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|werge: Let´s be straight: When North doubles 4 @H, he can´t let the opponents play 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|april7: he new it before that EW will go to 4@S, and wanted S to double if possible|pg||
nt|werge: N/S can agree upon on single point: THEY BOTH HAD A CLEARCUT DOUBLE over 4 @S|pg||
nt|werge: But a bad game anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a very good bid  2@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: it certainly is an area that needs to be discussed |pg||
nt|tomi2: opener took this 2@S as realy gameforcing and bid 3@H with the intention to make a forcing bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: on this lead easier now|pg||
nt|sybarra: no has to play the @H right |pg||
nt|sybarra: (again)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Well predicted, Mike.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: The problem with passing initially on hands like the East one is that the bidding may be  uncomfortably high when it gets back to you|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|tomi2: i have sympathy for making the "GF-bid" "strongly invitational" in this sequence, but I think you must discuss this with your partner. but then again if you have not discussed you ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should avoid 3@H "i hope thats forcing" and simply bid game with passed partner|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|400 volt: even with a @D more instead of a @H, 3 @D after 2 @S pass pass looks ok, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|werge: 2 @C is a text-book bid with this hand - we cannot play 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can "we" handle all of this given @H start?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may go wrong here|pg||
nt|tomi2: Fisher tries to falsecard here, dont know if this is a good one|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|pelu: S cant be a junior|pg||
nt|400 volt: but a nice defense, probably for down 1|pg||
nt|pelu: candidate for the Senior-team?|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to your comment,  thinking about whether I would introduce jxxx at the 3 level,   still thinking...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: well if clubs run, there is some chance -- and it's a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: OK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: really making declarer work for this one and perhaps-1 now |pg||
nt|tomi2: imo @HJ increases the chances of a singleton king, because K5 and KJ are both same likely and you would always play the low one, but with J5 and in similar situatuions players tend ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to falsecard too often|pg||
nt|chick: I find its pretty rare for the multi opener to bid higher than 2N ... it's more of a problem in the 4th seat|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|pelu: no but for sure I would bid 3@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: (I was not for bidding 3 @D with J942, but for 3 @D if you have one @H less and one @D more)|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too !|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on the get go, |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: grrrrrrrrr  -2?|pg||
nt|tomi2: no luck for the schools team|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: in other words, before the opps can bid anything |pg||
nt|chick: at least when the hand belongs to the opps of the multi opener|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: great shape to the hand,  even if its not so many points|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: South is squeezed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: and declarer is squeezed!|pg||
nt|sybarra: there , another way to make this hand |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: oops, sorry  thought he made it |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: a rare bird|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|7|nt|mdgraham: love all is not an ideal vulnerability for saving - similar to game all|pg||
nt|chick: so a possible small gain for Norway in a close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Wessel just left.. has to play bridge |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our new operator is Tim Heeres, welcome to you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: director at the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: welcome Tim - any idea why?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: good luck!|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Undo, operator.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: How to avoid 450 here? Difficult|pg||
nt|werge: Another BIG hand - 6 @d|pg||
nt|werge: Agood and practical 6 @s - but nobody will bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like a Muiderberg bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes,  but that was the right reward for the bidding and declaring :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it went pass pass pass|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: I understand these players all know each other well, |pg||
nt|baldfriede: There was a time when "forcing pass openings" were very fashionable in Germany, exchanging the meanings of "pass" and 1@c..|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: the U20's may be a bit intimidated by the older guys |pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@H looks cold, only @S lead and @D back can make it difficult for declarer, but impossible for the defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky place for Ace of @D |pg||
nt|meikever: see pictures of this vugraph table on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=29&Itemid=57|pg||
nt|meikever: all information on http://www.jeugdbridge.nl ... results of the last round soon to come..|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: this is another point you need to discuss in case all bids are natural... 1@S forcing, 4sf nonforcing here...?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 1@C was 2+ but 1@H showed an unbalanced hand, operator?|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room already finished|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx Mieke |pg||
nt|400 volt: I have to leave - See u all and much fun watching vuegraph :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy to miss 4@s|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Many teams in the German premier league played it.|pg||
nt|chick: we saw it played by one pair this past weekend|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: thx Felix |pg||
pc|c8|nt|werge: This will be a long way to 450...|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|april7: 7 tricks only, but an odd hand to open 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@C are becoming popular - were this pair playing transfer respones to an opening pass?  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: i would be really surprised if they didn't bid this one, with S having a fit and all those controls|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: in my opinion N must bid 2@c to show a better hand than 1nt|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - the problem is NOY to bid 7...!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|werge: NOT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|xenya: good point|pg||
nt|werge: Everything under control|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He could have made a grand try by 5nt|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree -- it looks a bit lazy not to try to find out about the trump Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if partner has @dKQxxxx its a good 7@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think south wasnt sure about the 6@D|pg||
nt|xenya: and he might well have that|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - even wutout the @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: without|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzjy: Jan says after the 2 aces, my dad should be watching now, He plays like this :)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: depends on their system, but can be natural. What will be the worst rebid from S in N´s opinion?|pg||
nt|xenya: to be fair, N has to have 6 @Ds for the grand to be good -- not sure S knew he had 6|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: suspect the reverse shows a limited hand within a strong club framework|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: exactly what Verbeek notices|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: Stuurman: we're not playing pairs|pg||
nt|pelu: smart guy :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|tomi2: yeah, probably the TD came to the table and told them to be faster to avoid a penalty. then operator has no more chances to follow the game|pg||

nt|sybarra: rube?|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the 1NT - do u like to open 1NT with that hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Thats what Geens told Stuurman|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2 or 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Does´nt look like 9 easy tricks - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lose imps on this one also |pg||
mb|2S|nt|werge: CR: 3 @S from North - not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it's their partnership Style...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont mind the 1 nt bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: it describes the hand, |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or possibly not a strong club framework... |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 7 only, but on @D lead 8|pg||
nt|tomi2: 14 hcp, offshape, Tx in spades, thats a modern 1NT opener, worked out well :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and now big problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm  does E have  @H in with his @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2?|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: they will reach 3N here -- can it be made?|pg||

nt|sybarra: kids you are killing me  :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3nt does not make though|pg||
nt|chick: if they are playing Polish Club system, it's a sometimes-strong club framework :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: hard for W to pass|pg||

nt|sybarra: but in the other room, there was no @H overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yup|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East did well to make seven tricks next door|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: After 4 @D from East, the problem must be to avoid the grand slam|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: but W never showed a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West showed 3@S-4@H-1@D-5@C, minimum and 0 kc, he showed wrong|pg||
