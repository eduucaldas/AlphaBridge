mb|1D!|an|Precision Club- 11-15p, 1+!D|mb|p|nt|xenya: just in time, Gabor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the final (4 teams) 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: i think our operator is Krisztina|pg||
nt|cicus: szia Hedy, hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|pelu: X or bid 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!Cs and !Ds|mb|p|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4th suit - GF|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||
nt|santyclz: An ugly 1nt with @cqj tight and no spots.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if pd X 1NT - then X by u sh be penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: would be a bloodbath|pg||
nt|athene: pushy 2@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gad Chadha from England|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what east is planning to do if west unsportingly bids 2@D or 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he has a way to sign off in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 3nt i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision Club: 16+p, ANY|mb|1S!|an|!s+!D or !C+!H|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

nt|viren169: any views?|pg||

nt|athene: no-one was prepared to grit his teeth and pass with an opening bid|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|athene: if i held the south hand and partner opened a 15-17 nt i would bid 3nt and wish him lots of luck|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt|pg||

nt|athene: 2@D majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: less clear now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C!|an|!Cs and !Ds|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||

pc|dA|nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: @s I mean|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: although the 9@H is great card to have in that holding|pg||
nt|viren169: not a good switch|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: north's rebid says no psyche, even if we didn't have an accurate explanation given to us :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: will they fight on 5-level here?|pg||
nt|xenya: very likely|pg||
nt|viren169: tough 4@H for E/W to find|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|athene: 5@C for N-S if they do, possibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@D as fit-showing?|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: Szalay trying to slow down the bidding biut can't|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did you consider the reverse even borderline with that honor structure?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it wasn't completely bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a great hand on pds 1@h opening|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I prefer 3@H here|pg||
nt|viren169: by West|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the club void facing no strength |pg||
nt|viren169: all too late she cried!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead was required to set this|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't bother with 3@H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: silva is not happy with previous board|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make, i suppose, if declarer picked things right|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no wasted points in @c....|pg||
nt|athene: given time, declarer can set up the long spade for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: but he won't get time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||
nt|pelu: will or can :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: when after A@H and @H ruff he starts xruffing and W shows out on @D the srop of K@C will be clear|pg||

nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||

nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: 2@c is strong but not GF|pg||
nt|athene: but south might open 2@H and it might go P P P|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2@d = week in @h or @s|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: yes   4 heart tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: i dont think the majority of Italian players plays strong @c|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C rebid now |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cicus: 3@C is 5 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: N should pass, unhappily?|pg||
nt|cicus: that would be a violation of system|pg||
nt|xenya: or is it not allowed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: desperately looking for a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East should protect over weak 2@H more difficult over multi|pg||
nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||
nt|othered1: A relay system should handle this trivially in about 12 rounds of bidding|pg||
nt|santyclz: By next Tuesday.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||
nt|athene: passing the multi was also worth considering and might have worked out well|pg||
nt|santyclz: How about 3@h xx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: no, it is 5-5 GF|pg||
nt|pelu: the close match - same good - and bad - bids in both room|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||

nt|viren169: Interesting dbl by North!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is north thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that wld be lots of fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little care required but always 8  tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: good match, good bridge|pg||
nt|athene: boo|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|ady: south for the time being assumed a weak hand opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||

pc|s3|nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||

nt|viren169: Nicely done by declarer!|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt E-W here, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 1@H X Pass 1NT should end it, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|11-15p, 1+!D|nt|hedyg: N doubled in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they stopped in 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak, 6+!H|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... 1N-3N for me|pg||
nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|d!|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever south does, west will probably just bid the same 3nt he was going to anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||
nt|athene: so both pairs playing Capp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double by west?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: If South has hearts he can bid 3@H to avoid losing 5 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 3@c was minimum|pg||
nt|cicus: and he accepted...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he accepted his own invitation|pg||
nt|pelu: and when pd sh minimum with 3@C - where did he find values for game??|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinks he needs imps..|pg||
nt|viren169: duck a diamonds seems like a good play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, after this board|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|othered1: I must leave for a bit.  Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Thanks, bye|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, the hearts aren't quite so secure that you are happy about esoteric safety plays in diamonds|pg||
mb|d!|mb|4S|nt|xenya: well it makes now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||
nt|athene: assuming declarer plays three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: now @HQ is sure to score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm how do you beat it now?|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane would have beaten it easily|pg||
nt|cicus: (famous last words)|pg||
nt|cicus: of course he could not lead a diamond in front of the eyes of 1500 spectators :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Homannay knows Szalay..|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane @D i meant|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c4|nt|hedyg: now forcing declarer to play K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: now show a high @D as well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: the problem is that if his @H was single, why did he not X 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: what happened?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|athene: finesse @S10 and throw @SA on @D is a flashy sort of play|pg||

nt|fabsayc: cute|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: probably Pinto should have bid it...|pg||
nt|ady: I think east might have competed with 3@H    |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|viren169: I think declarer played South for singleton honor or 2-2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|nt|athene: it just means south can't play spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: but there are plenty of other things for the defence to play|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: now|pg||
nt|athene: right :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|viren169: noone has any spades to play!|pg||
nt|athene: south discards the @SJ as a safety play against accidentally pulling the wrong card later in the hand and giving declarer entry to dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|s9|nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass of 2@d was the winner.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C was puppet stayman, so 2@D didn't deny a 4-card major, so east had to press on|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: 4@H in other room so looks like flat|pg||
nt|athene: north can just show the four winners and speed things up :)|pg||

nt|cicus: they have checkback for majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: walsh type 1NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H or @s by E would show a distributional hand|pg||

nt|viren169: maybe 4@H is fine...|pg||
nt|athene: small spade lead is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Think will get a coffe ...|pg||
nt|athene: through the strong hands's fragment|pg||
nt|viren169: milk and sugar for me thks|pg||

nt|xenya: tough after 3@S|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have doubled but what t bid over 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: poor lead when holding most of the outstanding values!|pg||
nt|viren169: need to attack here...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @DK might make things a bit harder for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so this is a Morten's Fork coup|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|ady: still down 1    |pg||
nt|athene: it's just completely unnecessary as the @HA is right all along :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: yes it seems so|pg||
nt|ady: could not be closer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 to go?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but this seems like a pretty dull 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @c is inverted minors|pg||
nt|ady: placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: bingo|pg||
nt|viren169: redbl|pg||
nt|athene: probably 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: if west passed the double, then north might redouble yes|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||
nt|viren169: I think West will bid 2/3N|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oops, too slow.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: interesting rebid, 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: light, very light 2 @s by Pinto|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead trump.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No problem|pg||
nt|athene: well played Von hafe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: You win the second club, cash 1 high heart and play 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|s5|nt|ady: mayh go wrong|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||
nt|cicus: it all boils down to Gamax needing a big swing in the last board to save the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it is a swingy board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: If I were North I would hold my cards up!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: it will guess wrong due to the "s bid I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: north has to drop the @CA (the card he is known to hold) so that west doesn't know he can ruff another club with impunity|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they are on different sides of the cortine|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Don't ask the English cricketers to take the N-S seats|pg||

nt|Walddk2: cost even|pg||

nt|athene: errr not a word i have heard before :)|pg||
nt|athene: curtain? partition? screen?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your comments. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|athene: east has a solid double of 1@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: swingy hand indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is some decision at this point|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@C is easy as the cards lie|pg||

nt|athene: 3nt E-W here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well at the 3/4 mark it's till anyone's game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: E in CR bd 6@c over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jackpot|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no 20 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: (still)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|viren169: 3N or 4@S E/W way anyone?|pg||
nt|athene: now west will probably go 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: or, of course, 3nt :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||
nt|athene: most likely it will make four spades, two hearts, @CAK , @DA|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||
nt|athene: well, @CA lead beat 4@S as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: given the SOTM|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||
nt|cicus: no only 11 tricks without giving up a diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: reverse dummy plus squeeze against S dfoesn't works as there are no entries to the W hand|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ady: thx all|pg||

nt|athene: true, lead @DQ would have reaped its just reward :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east has a 12-count i suppose|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzkc: :)|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a 12-count your eyes light up over|pg||
nt|viren169: Does anyone know why it is best to open 1@C with 3-3 in the minors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Any theory experts out there?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: On board 15 e neglected to bid 2@s so of course led one and set 3nt.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT wsent down in other room on board 15  with that fortunate heart position|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Do they make 6 @d?|pg||

nt|athene: i suppose you just pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Easy for me, pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it would be harder if you had a bit more, in fact|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm a big believer in that.|pg||
nt|athene: then you might be worried about missing game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: most of the time there isn't much in it|pg||
nt|athene: but with that hand, pass is pretty much the only sensible option|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: pushy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C leaves a bit more room so logically you want to open more shapes with it|pg||
nt|athene: if you were really worried about partner being able to unravel your hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west will get excited now|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision Club- 16+p, ANY|nt|athene: if he learns his partner has a singleton heart he will certainly bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@S 1NT i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|viren169: not so each to bid... when he finds values in diamonds opposite void|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then 2@s.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ady: that might stop a heart lead which can beat w3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: worth another try...|pg||
nt|athene: well if 2nt was normal Jacoby then east should have rebid 3@H showing the singleton, but either they don't play that, or east preferred to lie just to show a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: they can make 4 @s...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: south's spade holding isn't ideal after the 1nt bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: it means spade finesses aren't working|pg||
nt|santyclz: No respect for the 1nt bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I prefer J2N to be used with balanced hands and splinter or show a DGR with West's hand|pg||
nt|viren169: via 2@C|pg||
mb|6S|nt|vugraphzkc: I think this is the natural spot...and will make with overtricks|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 5@C  but would only be likely to play there if n/s compet with hearts|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not exactly a runaway match.|pg||
nt|viren169: any views about J2N?|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was OK i think - west's hand was just too strong for a splinter|pg||
nt|athene: but of course we don't know exactly what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2NT was jacoby (3 @h were short but Soucasaux prefer to say was minimum)|pg||
nt|athene: yes ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this auction's course will all depend on whether north finds a response to 1@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: if E/W misguess both @h and @s (and this one they will) 4@s or @s is minus 1 otherwise...|pg||

nt|ady: missed some of last hand      got the club ruff for down 2   instead of the heart trick|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|athene: last board now|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: last one. Thanks all. We will be back in about 15 min|pg||
nt|athene: E-W will bid spades and N-S diamonds...hard to say where the music will stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: for the last segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: but the non heart  lead  was surprising|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: This could go out with a bang.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: may get N/S to bid 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: judging by board 10, it will stop a while after it should have done :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: east, with 10 black cards, is entitled to hope for a fit somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north passed over 1@C??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but will be disappointed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 clubs now  should end the auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: surely cant be thinking of bidding on   partner has shown some values in his void  and he has a light opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: but think 3 @c is the limit...|pg||
nt|ady: surely must be   otherwise Pinto cant compete    and his is not shy   |pg||
nt|viren169: diamonds lost now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: oops|pg||
nt|athene: but apart from only have 2-2 in his partner's suits, west's hand is actually quite suitable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: Maybe Pessanha has lost his pass cards|pg||
nt|athene: *only having|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: And, in fact 6@ss can make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Gave his pd a stiff @s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok. once again thx all. See u tomorrow at 15.15 london time|pg||
nt|athene: well, i know diamonds are a minor suit, but it's not actually illegal to bid those yet|pg||
nt|athene: soon it will be, no doubt|pg||
nt|athene: even 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: or 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - 7NT isn't making i don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not yet... may be in the US!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||

nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
nt|athene: well, the opening lead solves one of declarer's problems|pg||
