nt|ralfwil: bad defence! W has shown up with 8P|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South told North that.. |pg||
nt|werge: A very good 6 @c here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|april7: this time a bad partial contract in @H for NS|pg||
nt|werge: Here South needs a @D-ruff in dummy to make 4 @S - or?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5@c or even 6@c|pg||
nt|april7: they play precision?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks as the cards lie|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzjy: yes they do|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|werge: But on a @D-lead, you go down, Best play must be taking the Ace, then @C Ace - and 3 riounds of @H...?!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yesterday you told about a very conventional system. I think this pair is NS?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes it is|pg||
nt|werge: - but not this time...|pg||
nt|werge: North mus be declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|werge: -did I say that?|pg||
nt|werge: For me, 3 NT is a normal bid with the East-hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|april7: just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: South must shift to @H, when he gets the @C Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: ruff a @D in his hand you mean|pg||
nt|tomi2: west has really 7 spades? thought this is a junior tournament :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: i dare to predict they will reach 6@C|pg||
nt|werge: And I dare to predict, that West might lead the @S Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a contract you wouldn't expect in a junior tournament|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|nt|april7: but could go down on @H swich after @C Q|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on now - is, that they are telling E/W what they have...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know what they told..  cant read what North wrote down..|pg||
pc|s5|nt|werge: 8 tricks, I regret|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|werge: If South bids a so-called Viod-wood, West might find the lead!|pg||
nt|werge: Void-wood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think North is relaying|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but a friendly one-level contract is fair for warm-up in this event|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: these hands are one of the problems with strong nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|werge: I would discard the @S 9 here|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|werge: Best card from South next seems to e te @H 7|pg||
nt|werge: be the|pg||
nt|april7: each @H is ok|pg||
nt|werge: With transfers yes - but the transfer occured too late...|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find q of @S doesnt he?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can cross the hand out now |pg||
nt|werge: No he can cross-ruff, when he discards a @C from the South hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|april7: 2 means can stand return|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best percentage play is one of two finesses but with 2-1 in @c he can have a discard so there is a choise with a @d lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: 7 rounds of bidding and only 5@c!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahalim: right, maybe they're not fully awake yet :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|werge: They should have taken 5 runds - and bid 7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@C showed 6/5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 4@H was rkc, and then it ended|pg||
nt|xenya: well this doesn't look too convincing to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: west thought long and hard about his bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: first 4 play semifinals and finals friday. so its a long trip|pg||

nt|werge: This is a VERY good 7 @S|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S or 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: The slow @D 7 is Wests own fault - he ca take 2 minutes before taking the @C Ace!|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a push,  never need to apologize for that |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C= great hand or weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, East got a trump trick now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: when he played @D8|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: sometimes a natural system is easier....|pg||
nt|tomi2: I like to play weak jumps even in 4th seat, so 2@S would have been my call but if you play standard methods 2@S is stronger. with reopening you sometimes make opps bid a game that ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: they would not find else, so I have sympathy for his pass|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|werge: Godd bidding, both tables play the jump for pre-emptive|pg||
nt|sybarra: go for it Raymondt!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or should I say "vince")|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: SjoerT Brink always calls him Vinnie|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  but I am not so familiar with him to do that |pg||
nt|sybarra: is N thinking of bidding?  I doubt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: He is|pg||
nt|werge: Another to the toilet? We fall asleep|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North is thinking..|pg||
nt|werge: Thinking of whom?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: of 6@S?|pg||
nt|ahalim: The @S Jxx makes this a good 3NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: in this round all nations, who send 2 or more teams to this event play against each other, like this match, to avoid this pairings in the later rounds of the round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: must admit that 2@C would not be my rebid with souths hand. 3334 and some kind of semi stop in spades, thats a normal 1NT bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes then N has an easy raise to game|pg||
nt|tomi2: north might now misjudge his hand and go for some club contract expecting partner to be more unballanced and have no help in spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|werge: Good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: good point Hans,  what was her name again?|pg||
nt|werge: He better only think of 5 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: strong club fo;;owed by a few natural bids would have worked out fine there i think|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: will anyone of you try 3@h on E?|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests 2@S bid took one cuebid away for north so he has to decide the final contract now, he will be surprised but not unhappy with this dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: a "non cue" |pg||
nt|sybarra: or help request?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|werge: 500 in your hand(s)|pg||
nt|xenya: not me Ralph|pg||
nt|werge: Sporty guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: or often called "last train"  (unusual at the 5 level) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: think he wanted 6@S but was not sure..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North, ok back to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be "happy" to be in only 5 |pg||
nt|sybarra: is "back to 4 @S"  called a reverse??  (LOL)|pg||
nt|werge: reserve|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: what if South gets an entry to dummy, he might take the @D hook?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjy: hmm not after this lead ;)|pg||

mb|p|nt|werge: Often defenders take the @D Ace, three @s-tricks - and finish with the 13th @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|werge: Here trick 11 comes from the weakest suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 8 tables..|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse also 6 @H and 6  NT|pg||
nt|april7: doubleton K of @D|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy|pg||
nt|werge: 6 NT on at @c-lead - South is squeezed I´m sure, when West takes the 6th @H!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: scores at:  http://tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: My lead is @c10 from that suit|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be in tempo duck |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: need to get the @C suit goin I think |pg||
nt|tomi2: he could overtake the @H, esp. after @H9 was played by west|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: But South will lead the @H 10!|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room did bid 4@H on 5 -- bound to bring them lots of points |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: This is a imp pairs (butler) So the score on the left is not important|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: it costs only 3 imps|pg||
nt|april7: so whats the loss?|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that was better|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|tomi2: and then play spade towards dummy, then he can make 3 spade tricks |pg||

nt|tomi2: thx Meike|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: washout only 1 down|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are gadgets, not sure I can explain accurately |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C, minor suit ask,  and 3 @H=4+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: exactly 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: otherwise 3@D, i have a 5(6) card minor|pg||

nt|sybarra: barrage like |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: indeed|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|werge: North´s jump must be due to the fact, that they play strong @C-system|pg||

nt|ralfwil: not even a try?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: http://preview.tinyurl.com/bskg9e|pg||

nt|xenya: however S needed to find a few specific cards with N for the slam to be good, so his signoff looks quite reasonable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this round will make some change in the standing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I think a lot of people missed the 6@C, only saw 1 pair so far|pg||

nt|april7: helo everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|xenya: there we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Sorry we have the wrong set of boards moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Tom,  hence my question...what can pard have?|pg||
nt|tomi2: those scores are the ones you must avoid in team matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: NS play strong 1@C with canapé|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: its not easy to reach 4 @S, but we will see|pg||
nt|tomi2: even if this goes -1, you gain only 3 imps but it will cost you a lot of energy to defend such contracts|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe S thought declarer had Ax? |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: you always know, that every mistakes costs millions|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 1@s? |pg||
nt|april7: neg. or penalty?|pg||
nt|werge: A rather lucky 4 @H for a beginning|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Morning Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Hans, Vladimir, Ralf and Gerbrand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjy: neg. :)|pg||
nt|april7: thats what I meant|pg||
nt|werge: Neg - at that´s why you should PASS with that hand!|pg||
nt|werge: Mojn|pg||
nt|xenya: a very lucky 4@H for NS here, but i don't think they'll get that high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Roland, Hans and Ralph|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: ranking at : http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/USS_2_Page1.do?event=goToPage14&rndid=52208&verid=3&catid=|pg||
nt|sybarra: more likely (imo) that pard has Ax |pg||
pc|c2|nt|werge: I open every 5-5 in black with 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I would show @S+@C if possible in 1st bid...|pg||
nt|werge: - but this was not opening, I see...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I want to show my twosuiter as fast as possible and not in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|werge: 800 - and now you must fight hard to get 420|pg||
nt|april7: and wait for the <|pg||
nt|sybarra: how we doing now?  Rehi |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|april7: and wait for the X by E and pas!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: May be they play 2 @S as showing NO stopper in the suit|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like a misunderstanding concerning 3 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: We are up and live now..|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hoi Gerband|pg||
nt|werge: But 9 tricks without any problem|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, partner must have that ace, but still I think north should not double this holding no trump trick and only one ace|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|april7: hi Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe forced to play the hts correctly here |pg||

pc|hJ|nt|xenya: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now 11 tricks|pg||

pc|c9|nt|werge: But North shoul have taken the Jack of @D - to play @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushy X  |pg||
pc|d5|mc|12|nt|tomi2: he could find a bid on 2@S showing his minor holding, like 2NT would be in my methods (6 cards in opened suit, 4 in other minor)|pg||

nt|werge: Few loosers N/S - but not so many tricks either|pg||
nt|werge: But might give N/S 1 point|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  and of course 1 imp can be "killer"|pg||
nt|werge: Here it´s not about 1 point|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: good morning from Sweden|pg||
nt|werge: Morning "hinsidan"|pg||
nt|april7: if N doesn't bid after 1NT then W plays 1NT, but N could bid DONT and play perhaps 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a partscore in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @S on?|pg||
nt|werge: It´s impossible to get less than 12 tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is fabulous venue btw |pg||
nt|sybarra: White House, in Amsterdam |pg||
nt|ahalim: ok they're still young and hopefully learn from their mistakes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: yes, they are the unter 20 team, so they have 5 years or more as juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: U20's need to get back in the game here|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: or some other convention after NT|pg||
nt|xenya: questionable whether they will find the fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: will start next week |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @D from North, pls|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gerbrand, playing there now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they are playing at white house now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzjy: Hello all|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @D might get E/W overboard|pg||
nt|meikever: next match on vugraph in 45 min is: Belgium - Netherlands Red U25 .. see http://www.jeugdbridge.nl for the full playing schedule, articles and pictures|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: That West-hand is too strong to be a 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but difficult to find|pg||
nt|werge: So - 1430, next board|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is refurbished tennis facility (12+ courts) and a fabulous building, patio etc. ) perfect for the bridge tourney |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: will need Gerbrand to remind me of names,  but 2 gentlemen purchased the facility and tuned it into fine place it is (of course they are bridge players:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: what does W bid?  5 @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East left to toilet..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant be sick,  he has the good hand LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Okay...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning Ralf and Hans|pg||
nt|werge: Looks like 120|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy:  Max Abram and Herman Drenkelford,|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Gerbrand,  I just could not remember the names |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: North telling SW, that East left|pg||
nt|werge: West can see his own @H-holding - so he knows, that Easts 4 @D is a big hand with self-made @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and does 5 @S say W has control of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tricky stuff |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think many of us "plain vanilla" types would bid 5 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: and Gerbrand, our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: you are very aggressive Hans|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does 5 !N ask for club control?|pg||
nt|werge: For Aces - 4 NT was not available|pg||
nt|sybarra: an told:   5@S good hand with spades, 5NT ace asking|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: we can probably refill our coffee's on this hand |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|werge: No - I just want to point out, that with so many intermediats + a good 5-card suit, you ar too strong|pg||
nt|werge: Service double - good for East to know...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  we have landed as they say |pg||
nt|tomi2: Israel U25 are title holders here and they are among the favorites in this event. Others will be Netherlands 1 (I think its red, so we will see them next match), France and Poland ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: imo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Anyway - E/W landed fine|pg||
nt|april7: now NS missed 3@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|xenya: well NS have 6 top tricks -- still a chance they will take them|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|werge: You mean 4 @S|pg||
nt|april7: on @S lead only 3|pg||
nt|werge: If you do´nt start with 3 x "S, 10 yricks are easy|pg||

nt|sybarra: a chance for the U20's here |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: no Hans! they had only 2 @h and 2@s trisks|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: tricks....|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: but south said, you get 2 more..|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  not sure why it is called White House, perhaps a dutch friend can tell me |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Well it is a plain white building|pg||
nt|sybarra: that might be one reason |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: and they probably where out of inspiration|pg||
nt|tomi2: this board reminds me of a discussion we had in our team in beijing, does a passed hand have a GF-Fit raise available?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|april7: best contract is pass now|pg||
nt|april7: what about  N? W is not afraid at all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: This should be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West: When I played 4crd M openings pd always has more fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: 1N wasnt forcing but south bid 2@C anyway..|pg||
nt|sybarra: cue's start a force |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose it´s early in Holland....|pg||
nt|april7: what? S doesn't X???|pg||

nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont you love it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I see what you mean but he showed @h so 2@h had been Jacobyr without a @h control|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: can't |pg||
nt|xenya: everything wrong for NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: East starts asking about the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: now "we" just have to make it |pg||
nt|tomi2: one teammate holding a very similar hand bid 2@S in this situation, that is normaly GF in their methods, intending to show a "verrry maximum hand" but to pass partners 3@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: while 2NT would be invitational and require extras from partner for game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: and this is not so easy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|werge: Let´s be straight: When North doubles 4 @H, he can´t let the opponents play 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|april7: he new it before that EW will go to 4@S, and wanted S to double if possible|pg||
nt|werge: N/S can agree upon on single point: THEY BOTH HAD A CLEARCUT DOUBLE over 4 @S|pg||
nt|werge: But a bad game anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a very good bid  2@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: it certainly is an area that needs to be discussed |pg||
nt|tomi2: opener took this 2@S as realy gameforcing and bid 3@H with the intention to make a forcing bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: on this lead easier now|pg||
nt|sybarra: no has to play the @H right |pg||
nt|sybarra: (again)|pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|tomi2: i have sympathy for making the "GF-bid" "strongly invitational" in this sequence, but I think you must discuss this with your partner. but then again if you have not discussed you ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: should avoid 3@H "i hope thats forcing" and simply bid game with passed partner|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|werge: 2 @C is a text-book bid with this hand - we cannot play 1 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can "we" handle all of this given @H start?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may go wrong here|pg||
nt|tomi2: Fisher tries to falsecard here, dont know if this is a good one|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: well if clubs run, there is some chance -- and it's a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|werge: OK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: really making declarer work for this one and perhaps-1 now |pg||
nt|tomi2: imo @HJ increases the chances of a singleton king, because K5 and KJ are both same likely and you would always play the low one, but with J5 and in similar situatuions players tend ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: to falsecard too often|pg||

mb|1C|nt|tomi2: yeah, probably the TD came to the table and told them to be faster to avoid a penalty. then operator has no more chances to follow the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: some might bid 2 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: with E |pg||
mb|1D|mb|2H|nt|werge: We alle would bid 2 §h|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: maybe they play intermediate jumps this vul?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as pard knows you may have a dreg,  all is well |pg||
nt|sybarra: unfettered auction in the other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: no, it was west himself|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|april7: 2 or 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: Does´nt look like 9 easy tricks - or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lose imps on this one also |pg||
mb|4D|nt|werge: CR: 3 @S from North - not my cup of coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: it's their partnership Style...|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 7 only, but on @D lead 8|pg||
nt|tomi2: 14 hcp, offshape, Tx in spades, thats a modern 1NT opener, worked out well :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: they will reach 3N here -- can it be made?|pg||
nt|werge: West (also) holds Easts pass over 5 @C inviting|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, not so easy to see 11 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: kids you are killing me  :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: 3nt does not make though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: hard for W to pass|pg||
nt|werge: On the @d-lead, you make two @C-tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|april7: but not the worst idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: but in the other room, there was no @H overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yup|pg||
nt|tomi2: only needed: spade lead, no @H switch, spades 2-6 with @DK onsinde or with the 2 spades AND @HA|pg||
nt|davidb: N opened 1Nt in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i dont think south has any nails left after this match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: wrong prediction again|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|werge: Now they probably get a @S-lead instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: chewing on them?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yea|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: started with that @hk|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: didnt think S could pass,  bid=insurance|pg||
nt|werge: Merry Christmas now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: I dont know exactly why South knew that North has @D's too..|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened @D?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: May be they will rtop in 4 @d, friendly warned by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: South, sorry maybe, I have to much confidence in west maybe|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|april7: made in open, but I don't know how, must be a present by defence|pg||
nt|werge: Say you accept to loose 2 @C-tricks and the red Aces = 600 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: sorry, passing on 3@C was probably better West said|pg||
nt|april7: that is a way to make it|pg||
nt|werge: stop|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: at least he can not misguess @H here :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|werge: The spped proves, that East will make this...|pg||
nt|werge: speed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: Jan is trying to claim 1down|pg||
nt|werge: Somebody ought stop the board now...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: seems like that|pg||
mc|10|nt|xenya: the defence is easy :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: last brd|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx Wessel (our operator)  for a briliant job! |pg||
nt|tomi2: dont know the VP scale, but I guess this is a 25 start for Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Arifin and Tom, co commentators |pg||
mb|1C|nt|werge: 6 @H lay-down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|werge: 3 NT here - but in cloced everybody passed after East´s pre-empt|pg||
nt|ahalim: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back shortly for more bridge from the White House in Amsterdam |pg||
mb|1N|nt|werge: closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: they pass this preempt here too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: see you all soon|pg||
nt|tomi2: thx to our fast kibs! 25-4 it is|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and not way to come in, here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 min or so?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: will W cue?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *no way|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Now Big Brother is watching us... - welcome Wald|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he did!|pg||
nt|werge: Seems difficult - loosing 2 !- and 2 @h tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i think so yes... hope i can get coffee|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Mieke our terrific web-mistress |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: will reach 3NT but will probably go down because of no entry to the @h suit in W|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @c|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzjy: East is relaying,|pg||
nt|werge: There might be an entry, if you play a small @d first|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|werge: Strange result from OR!|pg||
nt|werge: We should be able to guess the bidding in OR: 1 @d - 1 H - @C -all pass|pg||
pc|h3|nt|werge: 2 @C|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|werge: Sorry, discard of one !-trick on @s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzjy: aah that seems more normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! and I cannor see why W didn´t bid 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: A little, yes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H actually the best contract,5@C difficult to play especialy on @S lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|werge: After 4 @D from East, the problem must be to avoid the grand slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: but W never showed a strong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: West showed 3@S-4@H-1@D-5@C, minimum and 0 kc, he showed wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjy: East asked only|pg||

nt|vugraphzjy: y|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: now @h 10 is a bad card for declarer|pg||
