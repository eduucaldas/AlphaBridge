nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||

nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||

nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||

nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||

nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||

nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||

mb|5S|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
mb|6H|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||

pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
