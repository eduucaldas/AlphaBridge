mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|brolucius: In a chapter entitled 'How to Survive a 4-1 Break'.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: No point in North bidding anything, it seems. Oh, he has bid. |pg||
nt|lestergold: a scramble now for damage limitation|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is not Stayman. He aims to redouble for take-out when (if) 2@C is doubled.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is a point in him bidding they may find a better spot or asis often the cvase get let iof hook when neither opp can sensibly double the suit contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: West knows he is facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: N-S have a choice of three (maginificent) 4-3 fits.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: with the 4/3 fits both facing thre three braks they my wriggle out of the big penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: and opts for the sure + score|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's 11-count is precisely the sort of hand that text books recommend you to downgrade. He should perhaps have passed 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Queens and jacks everywhere, no aces, and 4-3-3-3 shape. Yuk!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its only fifties and n/s will be relieved as no disaster|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: especially important as game not quite on form e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: England went negative on the E-W cards at the other table, so there will be some IMPs away.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: I think that W jusged well as he knew that when  N ran it may be tricky to double them|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: im not surprise david with a combined 24 points there are not hat many tricks availlablee|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: By Passing 2@C (accepting a collection of 50s), Carroll has placed his partner with a 11-13 hand, making game unlikely their way.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Not the most intriguing of spectacles, watching North struggle in 2@C. Let's hope for something more palatable on the next board.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|an| |nt|wilkinsona: but John Murdoch tried 2Dx here with less success|pg||

nt|brolucius: Now 12 tricks on top and various chances of a 13th.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not likely to be a swing here|pg||
mb|2C|an|g/f|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: No, but we can hope. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: like them bidding seven and finding the spad q|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you put your cursor on the Closed Room result you can see the other auction. It was the same, so far.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know whether my blood pressure could cope with that|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|an|rkc|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3NT (in the Closed Room) was not entirely obvious, since South holds some good cards. But Erichsen has bid the same.|pg||
nt|brolucius: auction is still exactly the same.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North now bid RKCB at the other table.|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: Norman loses patience :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT shows only 12-14. so he was unlikely to be able to discover that a grand was playable. The singleton in partner main suit did not help.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: but as David said, he had seen Espen only bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d8|pc|cK|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: espen bid nt twice then came to a little bit of life with the 4h cue bid confirming club support and the heart ace enuf for 6 but left 7 out of the question|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: East marked 12-14 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: 7NT 7@C |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good Scotty score from OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Heres the grand slam. Murdoch left the spade guess to last and knew the shape|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sommer: 2N is 10+ with 4c @H|pg||
nt|granguru: some played only 6@cs here...|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|mb|3C|nt|granguru: so this is a critical hand for the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S should be a @C transfer|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sommer: ..called Truscot|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3C shows fit, 3S nat|pg||
nt|granguru: S didnt super-accept|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed Patrick. Murdoch discovered that spades were 4-2 and played, with the odds, the hand with 4 for the queen|pg||
nt|granguru: so he did accept|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|granguru: 7 depends on @SQ|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Now 4H cue|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: setting suit with 4C allows Keycard|pg||
nt|granguru: there is also (not here) a chance for a @S-@D squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 could have been laydown. Give South @SQ instead of @HQ. Not so easy to find out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so both aces AND club queen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary knows it is at worst on the spade guess|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: should try for 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: correct, and it may be better than that. 7 is a fair shot|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|granguru: probably 5n would have found no K and the chance for the @SQ would have been reasonably high..|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru: making 7@C a very good bet|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: Yes, heaven knows why South chose to respond to 2NT on that hand.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is a transfer bid, over the double.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep just the aces for n/s thats all|pg||
