nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
mb|d|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||

mb|2D|an| |mb|2S|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||

nt|kareno: They need logs, not splinters :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@S is the play here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: the lack of aces in the west hand is the problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: It's easy to have a good time with a fifty IMP lead and only twenty boards to play :)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d7|nt|kareno: Yes, and?|pg||
nt|mariner1: run some @S and watch is wise|pg||
nt|janm: And when he cashes the diamond AK, the Q will drop|pg||
nt|kareno: And east will be squeezed even if he started with more clubs.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|pc|dJ|nt|janm: And he's going to play the diamond AK early, so he can keep his reputation as a fast player :)|pg||

nt|janm: A spectator points out that he can't actually play the diamonds first, because he needs the diamond K as a re-entry to take the club finesse if he ends up deciding to do that. So ...|pg||
nt|janm: now he'll play a diamond to hand and some more spades and the club finesse, except that when the @d Q drops he can claim instead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In that case the spade suit is lost|pg||

nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you lose spades when opener is 4-3 in the majors and responder not strong enough to bid again|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||

nt|janm: Now it might well not be a push|pg||

nt|mariner1: Z counting his points here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I actually won't run without a six-card suit.|pg||

nt|kareno: Starting well.  If the hearts break, they will break later also.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So declarer will play spades rather than go for the heart divide?|pg||
nt|davidstern: What five tricks could the defence get|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 1 diamond I should say|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer can get 1-3-3-2|pg||
nt|davidstern: =9|pg||
nt|janm: Even if he cashes 3 hearts to see what's happening, he'll be in dummy to lead a spade, and NS only have 4 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Not if declarer works on spades  and diamonds.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I can see that, but does declarer know that clubs are 4-4?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can play spades before testing hearts|pg||
