mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: 1@c is balanced, clubs or strong - on this hand it's strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 1@d is an artificial negative|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: After that the auction was just as if Balicki opened an 18-21 1NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||

nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||

nt|kareno: They need logs, not splinters :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@S is the play here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: the lack of aces in the west hand is the problem|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

mb|1C!|an|polish|nt|kareno: It's easy to have a good time with a fifty IMP lead and only twenty boards to play :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mariner1: Karen that is an interesting concept....... book? :)|pg||

nt|kareno: MY book that hasn't yet been written :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|janm: 4@c and 4@d are cue bids - I'd be really surprised if Z stopped short of slam|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: yes|pg||

pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and?|pg||
nt|mariner1: run some @S and watch is wise|pg||
nt|janm: And when he cashes the diamond AK, the Q will drop|pg||
nt|kareno: And east will be squeezed even if he started with more clubs.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm: And he's going to play the diamond AK early, so he can keep his reputation as a fast player :)|pg||

nt|kareno: Oops, where is dummy's fourth diamond?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|janm: A spectator points out that he can't actually play the diamonds first, because he needs the diamond K as a re-entry to take the club finesse if he ends up deciding to do that. So ...|pg||
nt|janm: now he'll play a diamond to hand and some more spades and the club finesse, except that when the @d Q drops he can claim instead|pg||
nt|mariner1: another splinter though|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: when the queen appeared adam put his head under and asked ohno "Queen?"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|kareno: Ahh, I see.  And oddly Friday the 13th comes on Friday this month.|pg||
nt|janm: Now it might well not be a push|pg||

nt|janm: West has a maximum, with cards together in spades and diamonds and they have a 4-4 spade fit, but E doesn't know that and probably is just as happy to be defending|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W need to not reveal their points.  They need declarer to take the heart finesse|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: I don't think many play it|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: in Hungary they do|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|mariner1: looking for  9 here........|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Don't much like their chances ,,, but the real question is whether they can avoid 2 down|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true Bill|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|janm: With the spades onside, why don't you like their chances?|pg||
nt|kareno: Starting well.  If the hearts break, they will break later also.|pg||
nt|davidstern: This will make surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So declarer will play spades rather than go for the heart divide?|pg||
nt|davidstern: What five tricks could the defence get|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 clubs, 1 heart, 1 spade, 1 club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1 diamond I should say|pg||
nt|davidstern: Declarer can get 1-3-3-2|pg||
nt|davidstern: =9|pg||
nt|janm: Even if he cashes 3 hearts to see what's happening, he'll be in dummy to lead a spade, and NS only have 4 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Not if declarer works on spades  and diamonds.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I can see that, but does declarer know that clubs are 4-4?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can play spades before testing hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Can play spades now if diamond is ducked and later again.|pg||
nt|davidstern: @C8 looks like second top perhaps|pg||
nt|davidstern: He isnt control and will know clubs break when they continue perhaps|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they lead second and fourth?|pg||
nt|janm: I think that NS lead 2nd and 4th, so the 8 probably does look like second from a bad suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he now knows where the @dA is at any rate|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|janm: Oh, we thought you'd gone out for coffee -not! :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||

nt|bjacobs: It does?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it scores 3@D :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: Spade now for the game.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: Well, he's got his entry back, and now comes the key point of the hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|davidstern: Now will go down as he has established the heart for north who has the @C10 entry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|janm: NS have kept communication in clubs, so if declarer does play hearts before spades, they'll be able to cash the heart and beat this|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: As I predicted, I might add|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope, not making.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Its all in the timing|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which suit to play first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, folks, who said he misplayed it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes he gave it a go|pg||
nt|kareno: Needed a spade sooner.  Hard to predict but hearts 3/3 less likely than spade onside I think.|pg||
nt|davidstern: He didnt want to play spades because he could lose 2 spades 2 clubs and diamond when hearts were breaking all along|pg||
nt|davidstern: Onside/pick|pg||
nt|janm: But he only went down 1, so our string of no pushes stays alive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And that's all that counts ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes another splinter|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|davidstern: I guess as someone points out hearts breaking 3-3 is 36 and spade guess/pick 50%|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|janm: Well, we have to have something to root for and I'm afraid a comeback from 55 down against this team is very much odds against|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, my point exactly.|pg||
nt|mariner1: to be honest I think I would have found another way to go down,,,,,, and I don't mean|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have made it either|pg||
nt|davidstern: So we are moving towards a technical error|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you are going to criticize the play, then I think South made a slight error by taking his club ace when he did|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Possibly Hedy, but there is a world outside Hungary :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol so i have heard|pg||

nt|athene: you cash a top diamond from dummy first and don't care about either 4-0 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: the claim was with|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting hand... invite or bid game over opening strong NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: that...|pg||
nt|viren169: any views?|pg||
nt|athene: lol east in the other room doubled :)|pg||
nt|athene: no-one was prepared to grit his teeth and pass with an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if i held the south hand and partner opened a 15-17 nt i would bid 3nt and wish him lots of luck|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2@d = majors|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: less clear now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room is playing this in 2@s by e.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome to Markku M. Mäkelä|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nt by south is unlikely to be a rousing success.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: @s I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: although the 9@H is great card to have in that holding|pg||
nt|viren169: not a good switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: u have 4 toptrick and need 6 tricks on cross-ruff - not a big problem|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|othered1: north's rebid says no psyche, even if we didn't have an accurate explanation given to us :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer cant be ducking with AKTx? Can (s)he|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: the diamond is far from obvious, but declarer can not be open in spades or wins first trick|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|janm: More likely than -2, that is. We certainly don't want him to break our string with -1|pg||

nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||

pc|h5|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead was required to set this|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't bother with 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: silva is not happy with previous board|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make, i suppose, if declarer picked things right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no wasted points in @c....|pg||
nt|athene: given time, declarer can set up the long spade for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: but he won't get time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||
nt|pelu: will or can :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: when after A@H and @H ruff he starts xruffing and W shows out on @D the srop of K@C will be clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: drop even|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzkc: re|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|athene: south won't imagine that declarer has only @CAxx|pg||
nt|santyclz: He would have 10 tricks, but ...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would be interesting - the trick is to draw trumps and keep control of clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i'm not sure if it would make in practice on a club lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|viren169: either reverse dummy by ruffing all 3 clubs or hooking the K@D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: board 9 was also flat|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: so two pushes at almost the same moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: What took you so long David?  :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: they may well lose imps on board 10|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: By the way, specs should read the bulletins from this event (edited by Mr Stern) - they are a lot of fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Could be a record streak.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|janm: Hard to stay out of 3NT on these EW hands.|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can assure that the fun is in the reading |pg||
nt|davidstern: If promises of hands were articles it would be 160 pages|pg||
nt|kareno: You can always pass 1@d, though almost nobody does these days.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/ to get started ...|pg||

nt|davidstern: Club spade and heart through and club continuation|pg||
nt|janm: Sorry - of course declarer can't really get a second heart even if the K is onside, since dummy is sadly entryless - a good reason to play hearts I guess|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||
nt|athene: east might lead the @DA though if north doesn't show the suit|pg||
nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|cicus: well, Winkler's plan of slowing it down hasn't quite come off|pg||
nt|viren169: and I can feel Lencastre smiling!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|athene: and ducks, giving declarer the @SQ for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|athene: hoping for miracle @HK coming down, then there's no need for the guess|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|cicus: the best method to slow down the bidding is perhaps: pass|pg||

nt|santyclz: No problem.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: over 1@H|pg||

nt|athene: north might double 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: it may have taken a bit longer in the play without the 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's the least unappealing option :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||

nt|viren169: North has bid 3@D over the multi in the open room|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hearts/ spades here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yellow card to Markku.  Only Canadians or people named Joey/Joe are authorized to use NEXT.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 4@H for n/s     |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps east should have worked out the danger - south is bidding with a fit and a huge diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: in which case he doesn't have so much defence|pg||
nt|athene: his partner clearly has very little for pass then 4@S then pass|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|viren169: 1st partscore of the match now?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I know but Joye not around|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it seems so|pg||
nt|santyclz: No x?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: with all Aces right NS can make 9 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|cicus: X=3-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@H better rebid than 2@C, wd|pg||
nt|athene: south must be wondering where the spades went|pg||
nt|athene: he will try 3@D perhaps|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: I like the raise of hearts   with KJ10|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@S is down on careful defence|pg||
nt|pelu: par-contract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 3@D wld get 3@S from north and 3nt from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|viren169: North is getting muscled out of the auction!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats a poor valuer double by west    should be happy if they go down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl was matchpoints|pg||
nt|viren169: competitive dble by North? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: north has done well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x was 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: now no need to be careful any more|pg||
nt|santyclz: "Bones" x?|pg||
nt|ady: at match points can be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I guess so... a plus is a plus!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: +200|pg||
pc|cK|nt|po-s: double was silly|pg||
nt|ady: if opps have bid too high  may get a decent score without  a double|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or very rewarding, never at imps|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades a good save if vulnerability reversed|pg||
nt|viren169: may escape for 1-off|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|pelu: the only trick witch could go away was @CK - so now down 1|pg||
nt|athene: three clubs, a spade and a diamond to lose|pg||
nt|viren169: easy for us as we can see all 4-hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: +200 i repeat|pg||
nt|athene: well cashing the @HA finds the second spade loser :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why -2 in CR?|pg||
nt|ady: game not reached in the other room    in which case the double is less costly|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: in CR it went down 2, probably a diamond was ruffed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really the bidding and lead indicated this layout likely|pg||
nt|viren169: I prefer declarer to exit a club each time...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: and say a little prayer and hope good things happen!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S and @s S ducked and he misguessed|pg||
nt|cicus: he lost 2 trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: same may happen here too|pg||
nt|athene: one possibility was to lead a diamond to the @D10 and hope to build a diamond trick eventually|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: win heart ten trick one and finesse the spade|pg||
nt|viren169: never give up... sometimes opps will present a trick or two!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: south has hope clubs behave|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|xenya: now?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl play N for K 6 stiff in @S - |pg||
nt|pelu: N is a passed hand, so he sh do right|pg||
nt|xenya: well N didn't open, so perhaps there is a clue -- not clear however|pg||
nt|cicus: doesn't know about @HQ|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can't be sure how @H honours are distributed|pg||
nt|pelu: but Ns overcall indicate @H-values :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd misguess if that is saying something|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good chance that N has doubleton @S|pg||
nt|xenya: can't N have Axxxx in @Hs and Kx in @S?|pg||
nt|cicus: however, I am warned that 2@H is probably not bid with only the empty ace|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|xenya: he could overcall on that NV i think|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|h7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|h6|mc|8|nt|athene: it's one of the laws of life:- when you bid cautiously, everything is as friendly as it could be|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|an|forcing to 2NT|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Little scope here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: On the contrary - just negative scope|pg||
nt|mariner1: too much optimism here though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So a fairly easy 3NT becomes a fairly impossible 4@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: Considering the false preference drawn out by west, I would think 2NT would be a better offer of game than 4@s.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: actually that explanation may have been for 2@c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or 3NT Karen|pg||

pc|s4|nt|davidstern: Another diamond will kill dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|davidstern: Had he diucked the spade|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, indeed.  If 2nt isn't forcing then 3nt seems right.|pg||
nt|kareno: Now north will get in and kill the diamonds.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might take some setting tricks first|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|kareno: Not with the heart return.|pg||
nt|davidstern: West knows East is 5-4 in the minors - this being the case why not simply bid 3NT himself - partner wont have 3 spades and is unlikely to be 0-4-5-4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|sJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|kareno: The deuce of diamonds is suit preference and south pays full attention.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|davidstern: East has a tough rebid when asked for a stopper|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, nothing wrong with 2@H, in case of 0-4-5-4.  But the 4@S bid was over-hasty|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno: Well, it is what I would call a tired bid and the players obviously ARE tired.|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think the 2@H on the off chance that partner is 0-4-5-4 is unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ok apparently it was down 3|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT would describe better than minimum values with concentration in the majors|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: not quite sure how but both pairs were adamant|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly, David.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And hope partner isn't void-AJxx-AJxxx-Qxxx?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I certainly accept you may miss a slam on the odd occasion that partner is 0-4-5-4 but is missing that better than what happened here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it was the 4@S that did him in - not the 2@H|pg||
nt|janm: Hi all, sorry to be late :). I see that Cayne is still trying to keep this match a little one-sided|pg||

nt|ady: double cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: fireworks expected|pg||
nt|athene: ah no|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: sry little break. we're back|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: its 20boards|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might bid 4@S over that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|viren169: great hand here...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S looks like 500 on diamond lead, ruff, heart back, another diamond ruffed with @SJ|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt for N-S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|cicus: with 5 weak hearts and 4 clubs they overcall 1NT  I think|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S will fail... due to lack of pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4 loser hand.  2@c by many.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C a make       5@H  a good sac  down 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 4@H may be down on say a trump lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|santyclz: Doesn't 6@c make?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think E/S will take the push to the 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south will definitely sac now|pg||
nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ady: will it go higher than the 5 level?|pg||
nt|athene: E-W aren't playing a strong club are they?|pg||
nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
mb|2H|an|Alerted|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence to hold up the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: then you have to commit yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east's 1@C is a bit strange|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@D with that shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 2@H in 1. round - in moders bridge u need to take space from opp|pg||
nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i see it is usual to open 1@d with 4-4 minors in Hungary|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||
nt|viren169: you dont open 5-5 in the minors even if you have a reverse!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: where is Roland?|pg||
nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||
nt|viren169: this could be a telephone number!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: as you see here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||
