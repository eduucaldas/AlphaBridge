mb|2C|nt|santyclz: 4@s theoretically much better.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: as a bid yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: easy @h game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|robinswr: especially when hearts are clearly the trump suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 6@H here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but n/s may barrage in @S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@S is not a cheap save - looks like -1400|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|chick: goulash is right, markku :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: before North bid rkc he had to go over the responses and think about the 5spade response|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||
