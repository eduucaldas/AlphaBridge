nt|daman: nice hand     big bidding test maybe?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A thin slam|pg||
nt|400 volt: I'm not sure if you shd bid it :-)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not by your standards, Roland|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: It's actually not that bad if played by North, but ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: this is too pedestrian for Roland    he needs complexity in his slams|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@H is probably stronger then 4 @H|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|daman: South will be playing it     probably on a @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will get a club lead, though, so I think it will roll in|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: principle of restricted choice position in hearts here|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mike will explain what RC is (I hope)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: Roman Catholic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All specs are not familiar with the term|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you play the @HA, West plays the jack. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: With QJ doubleton, he could play either the queen or the jack - he has a choice of which to play. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: PRC means that you should assume that West did not have a choice - he plpayed the jack because he had to. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: in other words, his choice is restricted. This means playing East for Qxx.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Great lead!|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|400 volt: she doesn't|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: it does occur to me to wonder, though, whether the 2@C response by a passed hand is simply a long suit or encouraging  |pg||

nt|henryb: then you can pass two hearts and bid game when you have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|daman: E is whipping 4@H in any event|pg||
nt|400 volt: partner needs e.g. @H AKQ and can have anything else and 4 @H is cold|pg||
nt|henryb: Not on this auction|pg||
nt|400 volt: 9 HCP of 16 which can be enough|pg||
nt|400 volt: of course @H AKQ would be best|pg||
nt|400 volt: but @H AKx and @C K make it very good, too|pg||
nt|400 volt: for me the south hand is everytime worth a GF|pg||

nt|400 volt: I asked my pd of 9-10 of 16 HCP i need... He has 6 more, even if he doesn't have one or two of the cards I need, he may have another one|pg||
