nt|marlowepi: welcome back all. scotland didn't get kilt in the first half, but they do trail by the narrowest of margins|pg||
nt|viren169: hi all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both teams still in contention|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Morning all|pg||
nt|viren169: partscore to start off with|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back|pg||
nt|mowen: hello Frances|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Reading England here|pg||
nt|mowen: hi all|pg||
nt|finch: Hi Steve|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Hi all|pg||
nt|finch: x was 7+ balanced|pg||
nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: That is Walsh not Walshe operator|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||

nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be a test run|pg||
nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s or 4@s opener?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: but will stay till then|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: convention cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
mc|10|nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||

nt|jcomyn: I did say might - but small might|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, a weak two in either major with no strong option|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barbyh: hello|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a) why not PLAY for stiff queen of hearts? not unlikely, and how can low be better?   b) when in doubt, run the long suit       c) when NOT in doubt, run the long suit|pg||

nt|jallerton: I expect Scotland played better!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: To make 6@s on previous board is completely DD|pg||
nt|mowen: 9 tricks? or 10?|pg||
nt|finch: They play this as fairly constructive, but this is still top of the range|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an understatement|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that was Ireland's worst ever result since we returned to the Camrose|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: North-South are playing 4-card majors and a weak notrump|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure what South was planning... but it has turned a plus score to a minus!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||
nt|lestergold: at t5his vulernability i would have ventured 2c by south|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jferg: they were very unlucky in our trials finishing third 1 vp behind second|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: together with a club and two spads unless the defence carve up|pg||
nt|jallerton: possible endplay vs N|pg||
nt|lestergold: three qs equally 6 questionable points not really enuf for game opposite a strong nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: small club from dummy, what can North do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to duck but may well not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mm wont do his confidence much good|pg||
nt|ciaran: 6D makes here on the lucky spade position |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 1@h or prefer 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy: not neg|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no marshall, still making 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: in fact with all th heart tricks, the spade position in unnecessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does S do now|pg||
nt|sharkirl: looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1NT for me - God deals you 17 to bid 1NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: that solves that good old Black|pg||
nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
nt|ciaran: I slightly pefer 1H since you can still get to NT whereas a heart fit might be lost|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 1D opening makes me feel a bit ill|pg||
nt|jallerton: A very good 17-count of course. |pg||
nt|ianrei: i prefer 1H - now they also play 2C|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lotta action for a deal that might have gone 1@h all pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: looks like declarer will get the trumps right and come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agree|pg||
nt|viren169: via 5@S + 4@C + 1@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: line taken should be high @C, AK@S |pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure Brunner will be itching to play a @D as soon as she gets in.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a no prob 4s here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|cindy: if W had raised clubs, N could make resp dbl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-wind now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 5S re-bubbled|pg||
nt|james_h: odd double considering he is on lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance here|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek thinks oh No!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: now W is on the horns|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Easier to play in 3NT if you overcall 1NT though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|james_h: no|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mayors: They have to lead spade to beat it, otherwise with @D guess makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: unlilely that partner has a diamond stop|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||
nt|ciaran: selway now wishing he had doubled! will soon be glad he did not!|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - every option has flaws..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of bidding on that lot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||
nt|jcomyn: question is would Carroll have x 1NT|pg||
nt|ciaran: I expect he would, but Garvey would pull to 2D|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, 2@C was normal stayman.  The system changes completely when responder is a passed hand.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: Spade goes on long @c with them 3-3|pg||
nt|jallerton: another heart; will declarer finesse?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Reissmann from England|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|mayors: I think he'll get @d right on the lead  as well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ciaran: club leads hold 5SXX to 11 tricks and I think he'd be leading them|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prbly @D to K now?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|james_h: just trying to set the scene|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkirl: nope  lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i tyhink there is a play for an overtrick after all if declarer elminates the reds tghen plays a club to the J east will be endplayed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
nt|viren169: caught West napping!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barbyh: who knew clubs cd be so premptive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is there a 6th trick?|pg||
nt|jallerton: No|pg||
nt|ciaran: Though a minute ago, I didn't think there was a 5th trick either|pg||
nt|jallerton: EBU gained by bidding the thin game on board 1.  Ireland played in 3@s =|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mayors: although when it comes to the guess he won't know clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|finch: well, he'll know that West didn't lead a club away from the king, how does that tell him that we would lead a diamond from the queen?|pg||
nt|finch: as you say, if West plays a diamond now he may finesse as that will generate a spade discard from table if the queen is right|pg||
nt|mowen: tough choice for west now|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe just return a club|pg||
nt|mowen: a diamond is much more likely to be from Ace than Queen|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|viren169: easy come... easy go!|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond discard was reverse count in diamonds, I believe, or possibly suit preference|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes agree Steve.  I think he's going to make from here|pg||
nt|mowen: a good result if he does|pg||
nt|finch: counting his entries, he should win the spade in the dummy|pg||
nt|mowen: play the king to keep ace as an entry|pg||
nt|finch: if he wins in hand East can duck the second club, win the third and stick declarer in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mayors: The lead deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  |pg||
nt|mowen: is a spade obvious?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|nt|paulg: the other perennial question is whether to overcall or double with 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mowen: and which one?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|finch: I don't mind a club that much (which would not be successful) but I hate the trump lead|pg||
nt|mayors: low or J I don't mind that much|pg||
nt|finch: Jon Cooke may have decided to take the diamond finesse instead by winning hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: hes got enuf trumps to do it entry wise too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barbyh: when your sp suit is q 5th and you hts much better Im for dbling|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|finch: a spade back still beats it at this point|pg||
mc|7|nt|mayors: Surely he's going to play a spade now|pg||
nt|finch: no|pg||
nt|mayors: he knows partner has @c ace|pg||
nt|finch: By the way, either Vugraph has crashed, or Robson is still thinking in 6@S on board 18|pg||
nt|mayors: I think cooke is going to finesse here|pg||
nt|mowen: will he believe he has AQ?|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite difficult to work out what West's hand might be, as this defence is very strange|pg||
nt|finch: he probably 'ought' to finesse, as that is what he had decided to play for originally|pg||

nt|james_h: If you open your windows in Dublin, you should hear Terry quite clearly|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as u say same 10 tricks with some fancy footwork in between|pg||
nt|finch: Jon is going to be very cross about this hand afterwards... even though he took a sensible line|pg||
nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is tough, can not stayman and show diamonds unless playing 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
pc|c3|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
pc|c8|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ciaran: Declarer has done very well to get trumps right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkirl: and vul v non-vul, why stick ur neck out?|pg||
nt|viren169: +80 is likley to create a small swing with only 7 tricks available.|pg||
nt|jallerton: S knows N has 2 spades, but does he know about the ace?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: and east has set up the ninth trick but what could he do|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianrei: strange anti percentage play in H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: even then i would overcall rather than double. but i would overcall the four-card suit instead of the five:   xxxxx  AKQx  xx Ax|pg||
nt|paulg: a slightly soft defence, but only overtricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|finch: either the lead works well or you've let the contract through... I think the former happens more often than the latter|pg||
nt|mowen: I am in the minority in avoiding leading from kings against suits|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ciaran: no, but as declarer has four of them, he will score his K regardless, so switching wins when N has the A|pg||

mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||

nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||

nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|ianrei: should make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing that so far in thios set of deals the score is 1-to-1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sJ|nt|ciaran: The @DQ at trick one was revealing too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: true enough, but 1H could lose spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 40 imps could have changed hands|pg||
nt|cindy: marshall quit reading my mind|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm 23-6 good start for holders|pg||
nt|viren169: any ideas what that showed?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ciaran: I think declarer needs to take teh ruffing finesse in spades to make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg: Murdoch goes for the only chance by rising with the @cQ, but it will probably cost another undertrick|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quality of @H suit probably stopped a 4@H response|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: not to worry, shortcircuit after 12 seconds|pg||

nt|sharkirl: prefer 3@S now from N|pg||
nt|viren169: some form of ghestem|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|ianrei: 11 easy trcks in H|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H shows 5=4=3=1 max|pg||
nt|finch: he could have bid 3@S 5-5 max, but this way he shows the diamonds as well|pg||
nt|petepunt: can they avoide 6@S now|pg||
nt|finch: well, Blackwood will avoid 6@S if nothing else will|pg||

nt|petepunt: b;wood in what suit|pg||

mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: pass terry|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very tough to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit passive by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: garvey deciding whether to show the void or not (and if so, how to)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|finch: West will do well to find the ace of diamonds lead, but we don't know yet who will be declarer|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, but would E bid 4H with:   Jxxxx  x   Qxx  KQxx ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: even with 30 points the 4-4 fit is better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|finch: 4NT two key cards without the queen of spades|pg||

nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Isn't the standard defense to this type of three suited opener "double and lead trump"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: auction on 8: 1@s - 2@d - 2N - P - 4@c - P - 4@h - P - 4@s - end|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||

nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||

pc|dA|nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||

nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jallerton: in fact the hearts are blocked so probably OK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|c3|nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||

nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||

mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
pc|c8|nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||

nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
mb|p!|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||

pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ciaran: Usually don't show voids in partner's first is suit thoug, so may expect void in a minor?|pg||

pc|h9|nt|viren169: N/S played well for most part... but lost it on the last few boards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the mathematics of the situation favor a penalty double with the E hand, but clearly the mathesonics do|pg||

nt|ady: had north opened 1@D and south responded 1@H   might haved got over the top  though North only worth a raise to 3@H|pg||

nt|paulg: broadcast|pg||
nt|paulg: Also all of my fellow commentators and all the kibitzers who have helped|pg||
nt|paulg: Next segment starts at 2155 GMT, or in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when the double you in 1nt, run (Martin's law)|pg||
nt|cindy: who is Martin ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the immigration officer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mart's in-law?|pg||
nt|cindy: oh its you    you said it like it was someone else|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another big chance|pg||
nt|james_h: Its a great debut for Terry and Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: This looks about a 50/50 slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes DK and SA out|pg||
nt|viren169: last one now...|pg||
nt|finch: This is the last board.  Thank you to the vugraph operator, and my excellent co-commentators Steve Ray, Graham Osborne & Peter Goodman.|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks also to the English Bridge Union and Bridge Great Britain for organising the broadcast.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: i play weak no trump sometimes|pg||
nt|jferg: do you have a rescue agreed when x|pg||
nt|finch: Finally thanks to BBO and a special thank you to Roland Wald for all his hard work. We return to the Camrose at 10 am GMT tomorrow morning.|pg||
nt|finch: The Welsh got off to a good lead of a diamond from the North hand at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: a chance for Wales here as 41H looks makeable|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor fr  N/S looks makeable|pg||
nt|finch: looks very hard to beat when played by the long hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
nt|ianrei: tough decision for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Cooke and Garvey muddling the auction on not many values|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@H looks like a good raise to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: west hand improved now|pg||
nt|mowen: but what to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
pc|h5|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
nt|finch: decalrer must feel in a lot of trouble, but he can't really go off with South having everything|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: byeee|pg||
nt|finch: oops.... all Cooke has to do is win and play another club|pg||
nt|finch: looks like West didn't count his tricks properly, he's trying to get out for one off|pg||
nt|petepunt: blocking @H complicated things|pg||
nt|mowen: key moment|pg||
nt|mowen: it could be right to win and play K@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: trump back would have sunk the ship|pg||
nt|cindy: thx all|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
mc|9|nt|mowen: to kill the @Hs|pg||
pg||
