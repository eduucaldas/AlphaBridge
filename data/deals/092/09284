nt|dburn: and that would not be such a bad idea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is probably thinking, it's a good thing we have a 32 vp lead|pg||
nt|xenya: which is impregnable|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   he should know 6S isnt good spot|pg||
nt|cindy: 6N looks right with the source of tricks he is holding|pg||
nt|dburn: he cannot be sure, of course, that his partner does not have @cA rather than @dA|pg||
