nt|sharkey: see they're down quite a bit on the list - the field here, however, is awfully tough|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Declarer needs to finesse to ensure no entry to South for a heart through|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: easy 6@H here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but n/s may barrage in @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: previous hand easier if S leads low @D - then he can cash 2nd @D trick after ruff - makes it easier for pd|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|chick: goulash is right, markku :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|me argent: brave bid by south|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes there is much to be said for using kickback Blackwood when the trump suit is a minor or @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: before North bid rkc he had to go over the responses and think about the 5spade response|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may end up in6@C.. which also makes|pg||

nt|othered1: gotta get to game at least, so anything short of 4 doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: May also be worried about slam knowing short hearts opposite|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: 1 @H or 2@H with the east hand ?|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: 4@S is a slim if any hope|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think the 3@S suggests he has help in clubs|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||

nt|othered1: @C and a game try, I'd guess.  But west has relatively minimal @C and a dead (f0r thyem) minimum hand, so I'm surprised he would encourage at all|pg||
