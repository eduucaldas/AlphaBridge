nt|ady: 2nd dbl agressive by west|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West seems to have expressed all his values by his first double....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Comepeting for two spots at the Europeans in Romania this sumnmer. Thomas Bessis - Frederic Volcker are exempts (pre-selected)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: 3 diamonds may well make if n/s dont start with ace and another club|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East squirming uncomfortably, but 3@D is not too bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Oh - I thought that would be 2 places to play. 'Nobody' plays 2N as natural these days!|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Best not to cash @HQ - defence might make 6 tricks by winning @DA and switching to clubs|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Worried @DA was offside all the time and he might make no more tricks|pg||

nt|wwalter: good was not in red :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|danilo1: eventual overbid by West or East may be dangerous ... slam may be tried by partner than|pg||

nt|lestergold: true!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tweety1: 16 seems ok for a srtong 1 @c?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Landry thinking about 4NT at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He may fear that they don't have enough against 4@SX|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting deductive possibilty for East: partner has either 7 spades or a 2-suiter. If they bid 4NT it is probably a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And the only chance would be that the 2nd suit was hearts. Ergo, lead @HA|pg||

nt|tweety1: which cannot be bid|pg||

nt|danilo1: what should be 3@C by South? |pg||
nt|ppilot: now popov as i know him will try 3 nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 diamond means pass or corect|pg||

nt|ppilot: limit 3 diamonds and ready for more at clubs|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has heard the slam try and has 3 bullets!|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @d or 4@h ?|pg||

nt|danilo1: 4@C by South is much better bid than 3@S ... he is limited in precision, and hand is very good, esp. since 1S should be 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: wonder how much time this will last ? no duplication at all and still many stones to be made|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mmmakela: good lead director bid, needs to duck 1st|pg||
