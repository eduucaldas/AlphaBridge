mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|paulhac: Interesting choice of X|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: equal level conversion (bid @D over @C shwing no extras) is the rationale|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show how wrong double is if you don't play ELC|pg||

nt|othered1: Equal level conversion -- you may double off-shape, if you don't raise the level of the bid.  Here, you can convert 2@C to 2@D without raising the level and you've had the benefit ...|pg||
