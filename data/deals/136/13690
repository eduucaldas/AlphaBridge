nt|bucheister: thank you Nick|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nickf: I think there was a score correction from the previous set, still a good lead to the juniors|pg||
nt|nickf: we'll see when the official score is posted on score site http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/2010/final/anotfin.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bucheister: A very artifical system employed by Klinger and Edgtton; many transfers|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d multi - don't know if they could have anything other than a weak 2M and DBL is almost certainly "pass or correct" - wanting to play 2@sx if opener has spades, but to compete to ...|pg||
nt|janm: 3@h if he has hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: 1D showed hearts and 2S is a heart raise|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably RDBL showed a good hand (he certainly has that :)), and 3@h confirms that DBL was pass or correct, since he wouldn't bid 3@h otherwise. |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|bucheister: Sorry it is not Klinger but Gosney|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|janm: Klinger sensibly decides neither to DBL or bid more at nobody vul - I guess he's seen his partner's weak 2 bids before|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nickf: not a great start for the Howard team in set 2 - I am backing this to make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bucheister: Your are right; I had the wrong hand and player; interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: my fault had players in wrong seats|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: I have always been told not to pass with AK of trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger: "could be a challenge"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: NS will take 3 tricks, either quickly or eventually, for a very flat first board to the set (unless someone foolishly saves in 5@h in the other room)|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Jan|pg||
nt|janm: Hi Nick, thanks for inviting all of us to Australia|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi nick, specs :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: I have been told that takeout doubles should be taken out|pg||

nt|janm: Hi Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: the "kiddies" are having the better of this final so far|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janm: I was wondering whether Klinger-Mullamphy might use 2@s for a 2-suiter, but apparently this isn't a "weak" hand for them|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|itinerant: Justin Howard is 20 yrs old, Michael Whibley (ex NZ) 22yrs|pg||
nt|janm: That's great!!|pg||
nt|itinerant: In the other room Nabil Edgtton is 18 yrs old this saturday, and Paul Gosney is 24|pg||
nt|itinerant: correction, Paul Gosney is 25 yrs old|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|janm: North has very good holdings in both of West's suits and might decide to try for a penalty here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: It's certainly great to see 4 players who are still eligible to compete in the Juniors doing so well. Will we be seeing them in Philadelphia in October?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|itinerant: the four of them, along with Nabil's older brother Adam (19 yrs) and Andy Hung (22 yrs) are off the world youth Champs in Philidelphia later this year|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: I'd have thought Mullamphy was in a forcing situation here but apparently ot|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mullamphy has probably shown an invitational hand with five spades now|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Roland, hi specs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The question is whether he is worth it opposite 12-14|pg||
nt|itinerant: hi nick :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janm: or not rather|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|bucheister: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Ed and John|pg||
nt|nickf: Juniors looking shaky already this set|pg||
pc|d3|nt|itinerant: one would suspect a few imps will be coming back Klinger's way when board 15 is scored with the open room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|bucheister: Many play that a 2D response shows a minimum and denies 3S or 4H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|itinerant: one of australia's top pairs (sartaj hans - tony nunn) play almost NO forcing passes!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|vugrapha2: lost the play sorry|pg||

nt|janm: I do have some feeling that if he wasn't going to double 3@h, he shouldn't have doubled 3@d, but maybe that's also hindsight|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger has a plane to catch...SOON|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: this will be fast and furious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: Can NS make 5H here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|itinerant: it will be hard for mullamphy to stay out of game with that shape|pg||
nt|itinerant: especially since his partner is credited with the phrase "six-five, come alive!"|pg||
nt|nickf: that's what a reputation does to you|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem that the diamond losers can be held to 1|pg||
nt|janm: Wonder what methods Mullamphy has available here - must have had something other than 2@s or the 2@s would have been a little more prompt|pg||
nt|itinerant: if there's a gadget for it, Ron and Matt probably use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: EW don't really have enough to push them, especially since they don't know about the club fit|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|itinerant: tell me, Jan, would you use 2NT in Mullamphy's seat as natural?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bucheister: 2nt id probably good/bad 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West bid 4@D?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: OK|pg||
nt|itinerant: now he's shown a bad hand with diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: this looks like 690|pg||
nt|janm: This DBL is a little pushy - surely he didn't have anything in reserve for his 1@s bid vul vs not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: I think this is an auction that screams for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's like  1@S  1NT  ;  2@D   pass|pg||
nt|itinerant: likely that dummy will be ruffing hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: edgtton asking about 'attitude leads'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bucheister: strongly agee; diamond lead|pg||
nt|itinerant: just in time to take the contract -1|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|itinerant: oops|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|itinerant: 4C, fit-showing, from East might have led to a better result for EW but it's hard to say the E hand is worth it|pg||
nt|janm: No, I think 2NT should be some sort of raise, as is 2@s and perhaps also the 4m bids|pg||
nt|itinerant: The @sQJ look like tram tickets on defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and signals|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Sandra Landy of England had a Bols Tip in the 80's. Whenever the auction suggests a trump lead, you should lead one regardless of your holding, even from Kx. The trick will come ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back with interest |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|c8|nt|itinerant: mullamphy recognised the trump control issue and witheld from ruffing a second heart - the only play to make after the diamond duck was, in fact, hearts 33|pg||
nt|janm: I thought that showing 3 spades and some values was about all E was worth - with only 3 spades, he can't really want to force to the 4 level can he?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and discards|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|itinerant: klinger doing a good job of stripping this hand|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SJT98HKQT842D2CJ4,SHJ6DAQT7654CKQ62,S76432H93D98CT875,SAKQ5HA75DKJ3CA93|sv|n|nt|itinerant: had he ruffed one heart, ruffed a spade to hand, ruffed a heart and ruffed back to hand, he would have only 2 trumps left - same as east|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|itinerant: though he took whibley's double at it's word and played him for the other diamond honour|pg||
mb|3S!|an|minors|nt|janm: He was concerned (rightly of course) with making sure he didn't go down, must have seen some danger we missed|pg||
nt|janm: It must have been hard to believe that Whibley doubled on what he had|pg||
nt|itinerant: i think he was just looking for KQx of diamonds in the West hand after the double... and fair enough too|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: You're surely right|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|itinerant: heading for 3nt|pg||
nt|itinerant: not an easy contract with these breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Now there's a 1@s overcall - with Klinger's hand you might DBL if the opponents got to the 4-level :)|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|bucheister: interesting bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|an|exclusion|nt|itinerant: good decision from Whibley|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: ... makes up for the last hand|pg||
mb|6D|nt|itinerant: given 3C was forcing, Mull' could be certain he would get a chance to double at a higher level.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|itinerant: there's an inference here for declarer: Mullamphy must  have diamonds also|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1SJHJ9842DAQ9842C6,SAKQHT653DJ6CQ932,S93HKQ7DT753CAJT4,ST876542HADKCK875|sv|e|nt|bucheister: so maybe the double should not have been made on that hand|pg||
nt|itinerant: perhaps|pg||
nt|itinerant: ok, so he did draw th elast trump, but lightening quick so it escaped the vugraph operator|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|itinerant: a common agreement is that double of a freely bid 3NT by the player sitting over the dummy would ask for dummy's 1st bid suit - that might have been a more profitable punt from ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: North on the previous hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|janm: 2@d alerted, which sounds as if 2@c was Puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: yeah, they play a variation of Keri|pg||
nt|itinerant: 5 card major stayman, in other words|pg||
nt|janm: Some play that 2@d in response to Puppet Stayman shows no 4 or 5 card Major, apparently they just deny 5, but that was all Klinger cared about|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: another lovely puzzle for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|janm: Clubs like well, but both pointed suits are badly placed - still, exactly 9 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|itinerant: new players sometimes hear that it's right with this club suit to cash the A or K first, in case of stiff Q offside|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: With plenty of tricks in the side suit, the 5-1 trump break won't bother him|pg||
pc|h2|nt|itinerant: but taking a first round finesse will collect Qxxx onside, 4 times as likely as stiff Q offside!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bucheister: good spots|pg||
nt|janm: But of course 4 to the Q onside is more likely than stiff Q offside :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||

nt|janm: I think it would be 4 times as likely if there were only 5 missing clubs - it's even more here with 6 - there is only 1 stiff Q, but 10 small doubletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: note that if you had 3 clubs opposite the AKJTx you could catch a stiff queen and Qxxx by cashing the A or king first|pg||
mb|1N|nt|itinerant: board 15 was imps in to Klinger as predicted and we now have a 23imp difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|itinerant: but with only 2 little clubs opposite the 5 card suit, it's either or|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Can they get to 5@D I wonder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trciky to get to 5D|pg||
nt|itinerant: yeah, well noted|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: evenm 6 on if Ds break|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Would you pass 1@s doubled with Klinger's hand at this vulnerability?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: excellent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H the key call|pg||
nt|itinerant: difficult for mullamphy to pass with this moster but he's shown his values already|pg||
nt|itinerant: interesting that klinger didn't go for the blood by passing - even at this vul - i guess he didn't llike his pips|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|itinerant: with a singleton somewhere i would pass - the pips look like ruffs rather than natural trump ytricks|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if he's right - probably can only beat it 1|pg||
nt|janm: Assuming he makes 3NT of course :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|itinerant: klinger has a choice - finesse CQ or SQ for 11 tricks - both work|pg||
pc|hA|mc|10|nt|marlowepi: not sure it is that hard to pass with only doubleton D. with a lot of diamonds to queen & a card klinger would have bid long ago|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|itinerant: Howard proving it's not ALWAYS right to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|janm: Your right, "hindsight" dbles are great!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W should not have taken E exit card away|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: i wonder how many different 6-10 raises ron has available ;)|pg||
nt|janm: Probably Klinger has options of what to show with this hand - wonder what they are|pg||
nt|janm: sound 3-card raise?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|itinerant: this is a common situation: 1 minor (with 18-19 bal)  pass   3 minor (pre-emptive ) pass   'what do i do now?'|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what sort of preempticwe raise is that exactly?|pg||
nt|itinerant: It's great to chat about this  with your pard if you agree to play pre-emptive raises|pg||
pc|c6|nt|itinerant: 1D shows 4|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT vulnerable? No fear|pg||
nt|itinerant: interesting  choice of actions from Whibley - pass on the first round, show both minors o nthe second|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S!|an|=5!ss|nt|marlowepi: it requires discussion and methods, but the situation when pd opens in 4th swat, especially at favorable, is not like other conditions. alternative agreements would be optimal, but ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is work|pg||
nt|itinerant: what's your bid with these south cards, jan?|pg||
mb|2D|an|?|mb|d|nt|itinerant: indeed, 4th seat opening makes the previous hand another story altogether|pg||
nt|janm: It looks as if West in the Open Room had about the same information as Howard here on board 4; whether Howard's decision was better or luckier I don't know|pg||
nt|janm: I agree with DBL - I like to show my 4 card major and don't really think it's good enough for 3@c|pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: dbl=@S raise and 3@S I guess = cue|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: Gadget goes Australian. i saw that movie in my adolescence|pg||
nt|itinerant: that way when it goes 1S (p) 1N (p) 3x   ... responder knows what kind of hand opener has|pg||
nt|itinerant: heheh|pg||
nt|janm: Although I'd probably bid 3@c without 4 hearts; but then I'd have another club|pg||
nt|itinerant: howard making another wise decistion - 3S would have led to a bloodbath and now NS find themselves in a no-play 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|itinerant: we're a little slow down under|pg||
nt|itinerant: so now klinger's shown 5 spades, 4 hearts, GF, tolerance for 3NT|pg||

nt|itinerant: maybe the bloodbath would have been better ?|pg||
nt|janm: 3@s looks a little rich to me with 4333 and the K of the suit bid on his left|pg||
nt|janm: You're right about 3NT, but I'll bet Mullamphy is feeling less than hopeful at the moment|pg||
nt|itinerant: yes, it certainly would have occurred to justin in his teens, but now that is nearing the nursing home at 20yrs old...|pg||
nt|janm: At equal vul, surely it's more sensible to hope that partner's 2@s has already done the damage and not stick your neck out|pg||
nt|itinerant: mullamphy desperately searching for a line that gives better than 26% chance of success!|pg||
nt|janm: 26%? Where did that extra 1% come from? :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|kiwibridge: exciting bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: spec points out that klinger may have been better to redouble his vulnerable opponents|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "correct on the hand as it happens" does not = wise. if forces are not respected, partnerships rot|pg||
mb|r|nt|itinerant: well, once one of the hooks works (50%), the other guy's 1% more likely to hold the other card|pg||
nt|janm: When in doubt, play your long suit, but it's hardly likely that they'll pitch anything useful|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: this on elooks like a pass out:)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|itinerant: i can only see 8 tricks in 3NT - 2 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 heart and 2 clubs (previous hand)|pg||
nt|itinerant: if one tries to set up hearts, the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: I'm not sure about the timing, but you may well be right. I was thinking maybe they couldn't get the 3rd spade set up in time|pg||
nt|itinerant: whibley and howard certainly have gadgets here - if they didn't what's your rebid wit hthe east cards, jan?|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: I don;t know who is thinking I'm on the other side of the screen|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|itinerant: will gosney bounce to 6D over south's 5H???|pg||
nt|itinerant: no strong club, so 2C says jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: he may be tempted to double 5D from north|pg||

nt|marlowepi: W may bid 5D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or not|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: whibley was thinking, i think|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|itinerant: yeah - hard for East to bid again if he feels his double of 5D did the trick|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|poohbear: or THAT|pg||
nt|poohbear: Edgtton thinking partner has defense|pg||
nt|janm: Surely was Whibley, and presumably 2@h is some sort of good 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|itinerant: trump lead will make this difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not a fan of 4S. if the suit were hearts, maybe. with spades and a good hand, often better to mosey your way up there|pg||
nt|itinerant: very disappointing result for EW|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: plus slam can be on eevcn facing a PH|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: seeing as the first club will be played from west hand, it's too late for the defence|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|janm: Now he can get 1 club ruff and lose to the A and K - you're right a trump lead would have made it harder (maybe impossible?)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|itinerant: some specs are sure the 4S bid did thte damage - i'm not so sure - i think West's double of 5H is insane|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think Edgtton didnt think enough about the issue . partner preempted and dbled to show a good hand BUT it is still a preempt based on playing strength so he might have considered ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: bidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if u bid 4S, it is preictable opps will bid 5H. now it MIGHT be OK to bid 6D, but wouldnt u rather get yr suits in at a lower level and let partner have a say? partner usually ...|pg||

nt|itinerant: heh|pg||
nt|itinerant: alternatively, because he has a club to lead from dummy, he can always lead it, losing only 3 club tricks due to the short club honour onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: fair point then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like the preempt|pg||
nt|poohbear: now we get to see what Klinger thinks of his partner's fav 1st seat preempt|pg||
nt|bucheister: why double 5D; it might go all pass; unlikely but partner will never play you for 7-5|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, the ruff was what let him make 5|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@d is quite conservative but devaluing the @c king|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S might well have bid 5C.....fair chance it will make & if opss bid 5D you can live with it|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the score is 137-68 in the other room, we have lost comparison here, looks like the Youth by a landslide|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am guessing E did not see the 4C bid & thought W jumped to 4D. of course even then 5D is dubious|pg||
nt|itinerant: The point often missed about opening 4S in third chair with extreme shape is that the opps get one guess (as do you - downside) and if they guess wrong, it's the 5 level and that ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: costs greatly  - I've seen many 1100 phantom style in that position|pg||
nt|poohbear: usually not when klinger bids|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2@ds weak multi I presume . less than 8 points|pg||
nt|itinerant: yuck|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mullamphy shouldnt pass|pg||
nt|itinerant: klinger has an ace more than he might for this action|pg||
nt|poohbear: but odds of getting to the cold grand are highly diminished|pg||
nt|poohbear: agree|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed mullamphy shouldn't pass - but how to agree trumps and blackwood from here.... ?|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you have a subminimal hand then certainly open a good four card major; if you have a constructive hand you open a five card major.  The system is the 2/1 played by most of the ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: good players in the USA.|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps he should have passed the TO of 2@h for penalties :P|pg||
nt|itinerant: that was surely the right thing, barry|pg||
nt|poohbear: matt should bid 4@c here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Problem playing against multi is that there is no convenient Q bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: I think blackwood from the south hand is not outrageous now|pg||
nt|itinerant: the chances of being off SAK are not high|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h might be the right view . Besides 4NT sounds Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger counts only 12 cards in his hand, finds one under the bidding tray|pg||
nt|itinerant: yep, good point |pg||
nt|itinerant: for anyone unfamiliar with bridge finals - the trailing side my concede the match if they feel there's no chance for victory. it's not considered bad form|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes 4N would not be BW unless that agreem,ent is in place|pg||
mb|6H|nt|janm: Again fairly similar auctions in both rooms. |pg||
nt|itinerant: only inspired play or unispired defence will bring this home...|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: or a lead...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: believe it or not folks, 750 for 5HX was a push!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a weak 2@D opening upset the bidding other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: But who knows? 4@h could sound natural too|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger "oh, not again"|pg||
pc|d7|nt|itinerant: loll|pg||
nt|itinerant: will howard have the nerve to run the C7 next time dummy's in?|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead from North - usually I like to lead my 5 card suit against 3NT, but when it's dummy's first suit I'm not sure. |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|itinerant: he has 200 points for honours|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: In the other room West dbled the 4NT overcall so he could have easily passed 5@h  to partner on board 24|pg||
nt|bucheister: Very tenative by NS; N started with a cue bid and S had 16 hcp and a good suit; |pg||
nt|itinerant: what time are we back for the next set, nick?|pg||
nt|nickf: checking|pg||
nt|nickf: in 25 mins, 15min earlier than advertised|pg||
nt|bucheister: thank you operator for a great job and to my four card major friends|pg||
nt|itinerant: thanks all|pg||
nt|itinerant: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: keeping this table until the opne table finishes|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: score corrected in open room, closing this table now|pg||
nt|itinerant: a low diamond exit will help north's cause somewhat|pg||
nt|itinerant: ducked... low spade to the K and ace, spade return?... ducked??....|pg||
nt|itinerant: it's all rather complex|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe it's right just to punt (return a heart) with North - everything else looks as if it might give something away (of course we can see a diamond won't, but it looks as if it ...|pg||
nt|janm: will)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|itinerant: C7?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: down again and a rousing victory it seems for the Howard team|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Gary and all.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|janm: Both sides have the same idea - let's put the other side in and see if they can give me a trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thx Jordan and Justin and every one|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s9|mc|11|nt|jcwla: Congrats to the winners and for now, so long.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Australia is very strong at the youth level these days|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: we'll stay open here until the open room finishes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I did have to laugh at seeing Michael Whibley's state as FOREIGN (NZ) as he is now a member of the Australian Youth Team for the PABF this month|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Congratulations Team Howard, thanks all for watching and commentating|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx again all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: closing this table now, cya next year :)|pg||
