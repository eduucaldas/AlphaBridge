nt|mr murray: 8 loser hand.  expects a lot from partner|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must have taken the pass card by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|nt|cuttysark: North has only 1 ace. His spades are good, but he should nonetheless pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What makes him think that partner has a singleton club for a start|pg||

nt|pelu: 3 eller 4@s fra Syd (efter 1@d)|pg||
nt|pelu: pass fra Bilde??|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: I saw there's a Keflavik Savings Bank team ... I hope our Icelandic friends don't take this badly but ... is that the last operating bank in Iceland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So we show one of the two matches, and definitely GT vs Verðbréf  in the last round|pg||
nt|athene: clear double with south rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like it on this hand 3-2-2-6 is not a good shape|pg||
nt|pelu: standard for EW :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would need play, with QJ@D and holding JT9x@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Nice 2@H by Jón|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has directed the killing lead against 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D did not even promise diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: south is max and may uopgrade bwecause of the dim bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should be wary of the heart position|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S   but even vul against not n/s have a save in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bids what she thinks she can make|pg||
nt|roswolf: east believes her anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if the majors were exchanged, you might perhaps bid 1@S over 1@H with the south hand|pg||
nt|athene: but when opps have spades, all the other suits are equal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club and club ruff also ok   can only get 1 discard|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I was surprised that there was even one left :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, it looks normal to bid with that north hand over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: surprised at North's lack of action|pg||
nt|roswolf: not an adequate return for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D can contain 0 diamonds, 4405 shape|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C was a good save.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, back to bridge|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps she's worried that 5@D would show more, at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: may but should make.|pg||
nt|asig: If the defence setup a club trick and declarer misguesse diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|benjent: That's a seriously gutsy 5@h bid. Not much shape, various loose honours. Holy phantom sacrifice Batman!|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: As it happens, it's a phantom save|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3n is lets face it a bridge players bid- win some lose some|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|pelu: not the best contract for EW - 3@c easy win - but when u open 4 card @h then u normal rebid 2@H and not 3@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If not wrong, 4@S a par contract on this hand.|pg||
nt|asig: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Can play small @C after @HA and can make.|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|mr murray: any of three spade cards to save the overtrick|pg||

nt|roswolf: north should raise the ante high|pg||
nt|pelu: that maded life easy for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D will pose a real problem for e/w|pg||

mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|benjent: North elected not to look for a major fit. I agree with that approach with his bland 4333.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup which would be wrong on the hand|pg||
nt|asig: 1@c 16+ or 15 bal|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for NS, but they may bid higher and @DQ lead is a dnger to 6@S by NS.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Best line, Jon?|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult, perhaps three hearts to see if that suit breaks, then a club and the dia finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The line in 7@S after @CA lead must be to cash @SA and play another. When spades are 4-1, you need 7 heart tricks and you will get them|pg||
nt|mr murray: this auction gets them nowhere|pg||
nt|pelu: so NS has to go to 6@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Nej|pg||

pc|dA|nt|pelu: men jeg ville heller ikke gå efter game i Nord|pg||
nt|ftpe: Alene i/z og en passet makker|pg||

nt|benjent: then play a @c up|pg||
nt|ady: may end up in 4@S    can make  needs a heart lead to hold to 10 tricks  otherwise an elimination and end play will get an overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Me too, but as we see it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after the @HK lead declarer will lose two hearts and the trump|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when hearts come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if it gets tyhem to 6@h which it has it will earn a bushell load of imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 14|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 ned|pg||
nt|ftpe: Nords 4 hj er meget vild, især når makker viser minimum|pg||
nt|jron: Colours (zonestillinger) are for children!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: if you get a club lead in 7 spades    right to cash ace and king of hearts   and with the good news will make|pg||
nt|mr murray: they went down in 7 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumn led to winning 14 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumbled into it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how declarer went down, David|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well have punted it for all the info they exchanges|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that dummy was already down to three trumps after the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't enjoy the heart suit if you play it the way you suggest|pg||
nt|lestergold: was natural to play for 3/2 spade break and esnure hearts ame in very unlucky|pg||
nt|mr murray: with heart queen dbltn  7 spades must make|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubole dummy yes but single dummy declarer must weight odds of bad trump break against odds of heart q dropping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once you cash @HA you are down|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced leave opps to make the last guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: also 10 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: why wrong to bid 6@d - 6@c is cold|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: or heart, ruff, trump ace|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjent: This way, he at least retains a @d finesse against East as his residual chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice duck by Ragnar|pg||
nt|lestergold: and heart q dropping is less likely |pg||
nt|mr murray: when u find out spades 4-1 u close you draw trumps,close your eyes and your prayers are answered|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible declarer might sneak 11 tricks through, winning this and leading a small spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: getting two rounds drawn fast and depriving north of her ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: but of course east doesn't know where the @SA is|pg||
nt|ady: on haqnd 2  in OR north did bid 5@D  after 1@S double 4@S  and got 6 imps as e/w went to 5@S  for 300|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: even 6@h will win - spechts tell me :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well true but i am not sure it is clear to sac - but on insurance principles it is a lesser risk perhaps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: It may present an overtrick, but he is trying to beat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraph815: sorry, I lost it|pg||
nt|athene: south now knows her partner hs a heart ruff coming, so probably won't duck a small spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: np, assume 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|pelu: så nu tjener han måske 1 imp - 150/170|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||

nt|mr murray: spade ace spade to queen. find out 4-1 . then spade to jack diamond to ace draw last trump and get lucky heart position|pg||
nt|pelu: so par-contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS MAY BE FEISTY|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 HP i ØV - men lang vej til 9 stik i 3ut|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes   spade play first is right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: rotten pre-empt vul imo|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 5@D reasonable contracts for EW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: I thonk so|pg||
mb|1H|nt|benjent: I think EW can make 4@s here, but you have to play double-dummy to get home|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H can be defeated  with a heart ruff   but likely e/w will go to 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: sorry club ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: no topcard in suit and 7 losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w going over the top!?|pg||
nt|ftpe: ja, mon dog ikke de stopper inden?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|asig: 5 @c is a good save against 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The key is to play a @c to the K, then duck a @c. Later, you can play a @c towards the J. The point is you only get to ruff 2 things in dummy, so you need actual @c tricks to make ...|pg||
nt|benjent: your contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west has a fair bit of defence|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts can be down 1   and 4 spades down 1|pg||
nt|athene: she might not sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 10 tricks, if declare can untangle the hearts|pg||

pc|s5|nt|roswolf: this will appear precarious|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes-5@D choice of contract-same tricks.|pg||
nt|asig: (QJ and finesse the 8)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|benjent: This lead actually gives small hope ... if you can just guess which @c honour is onside|pg||
nt|ady: this looks automatic down 1|pg||
nt|ady: soade lead and club return|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead, club switch looks pretty reasonable, yes|pg||
nt|pelu: but 800 against 4@s and 1100 against 5@c|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: men de ved ikke at de har 25 HP - hvis Vest åbner med 1ut (15-17) vil man ofte komme i 3ut|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ady: east was able to make her bid at the 3 level  so could leave the decision to partner|pg||

nt|Walddk2: How disciplined is Sigurbjörn?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: imo 6@S better than 6@H, do you agree or we see 4 only.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ftpe: Troede syd havde luft til en dobling|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: It demands a pass, really|pg||
nt|benjent: It's funny to Australian eyes to see "Grant Thornton" as an Icelandic team. I know them as a mid-sized accounting firm mostly in English-speaking countries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well done|pg||
nt|jbgood: thx kibs, a transfer to 2@c..|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still, it looks nice:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double?|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know 2@D?|pg||
nt|ady: ok thx|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is minimum shapely in standard methods|pg||
nt|athene: south does have a fairly suitable hand facing @D-@S 2-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: especially with finesses likely to work|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, she does have a 7-loser hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: I think you find GT in most countries in western Europe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Accounting, yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: this seems optimistic|pg||

nt|jbgood: he would only get one ruff anyhow|pg||
nt|ady: £@H  poor cjoise   nothing to spare|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H|pg||
nt|asig: But 6@S is played from wrong side|pg||
pc|s5|nt|asig: Thus making 6@h the best contract|pg||
nt|ftpe: han passede første gang|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: easy 12 tricks with spades 3-3, diamonds coming in, and the club right|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant cost to play the 10 can it?|pg||
nt|pelu: the ladies missed the slam om Board 6 - but the got the contract in 5@H - so 6500 against 500 is a win - operation failed but the paient full alive :):)|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|benjent: I must confess, I'm surprised that TWO pairs in the world believe that 1NT was the right bid with that 8-bagger @c suit on board 8|pg||
