nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: it won't be a big surprise for me to watch aggsressive bidding & carding|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|h7|mc|10|nt|daman: North does not have a lot of options|pg||

nt|gracelin: a great result for Lavazza in close room, NS stole the contract from EW wh can make 5C and maybe 4S.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: yes, W was a bit too passive there|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|gracelin: people would laugh at south's Vul. 1D overcall in the past but now it seems standard.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|xenya: when he failed to get in over S's 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: agree with Vlad, west too passive in CR|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: decarer is warned by the 4-1 trump break last hand.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: with all cards in view, this is an easy make, but declarer doesn't have that advantage|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: no doubt he places S with more honour cards than he actually has |pg||
nt|gracelin: seems a good start to make the contract|pg||
nt|shevek: all he needs now is the @c finesse|pg||
nt|gracelin: as said, that would give south very little for his Vul. 1D overcall|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will declarer know that south is out of Heart with the HJ lead ?|pg||
nt|gracelin: if so he can play SA and spade safely.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and make 4S with both black K's wrong, and trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/main.html  for standings after round 2. You have to navigate a little and it's all in Italian|pg||
nt|shevek: hard to tell, Cima would have led the J from JTx|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: Sementa asked Masoero if 2@H is forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: Masoero answered 1@S would be forcing, 2@h is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lavazza 48 - Angelini 41 - Fornaciari 40|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Round-robin among 10 teams|pg||

nt|xenya: hello magnus|pg||
