nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sybarra: 5 @D makes n/s  can they get there |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: ok which is more likely ....  @HQxx offside, or 5-0 spade split?  |pg||
nt|peachy: I think Souths multiple shortnesses indicate hearts shuld be trump to avoid taps, but we'll see|pg||
nt|friggi: my bet is 6S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 5?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 nt? |pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: looks like spades, so far:)|pg||
nt|friggi: agree.)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some chance they will bid 7@S.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probable|pg||
nt|friggi: .............grrrrrrrr that is hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: probably 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: now all depends on the lead |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|djneill: South has just 10 HCP, but two interesting trick sources - a 4-4 @s fit, or else the long @d, worth an invite if 12-14|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: big mistake to take the first @S, but he is lucky now... :)|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: he can cause lots of problems for both opps playing lots of @D's |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: and for the operator as well... :)|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: you only need one club ruff as cards lie. anyway 2 trumps will show N what he must playt for|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i thnk he should have played ace of spades and a spade to hand. if they are 4-1, he needs the whole heart suit. if they weer 32, he can ruff up the hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill: East should probably double rather than bid 2@d, in my eyes|pg||

nt|sybarra: not my favorite pattern for 1 nt,   (5422)  but another rebid problem with out it |pg||

pc|h2|pc|d2|nt|djneill: North has 2@d, 1@h, 1@c losers, so needs to play the @c for just 1 loser to make this - one thing that helps is that E-W might break @c or @h after cashing the 2nd @d|pg||

pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: necessary if N had AQT of Ds|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: and this is a winning position also|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill: East's 4@c bypassed 3@s, so East does not have a @s control - so when West cue-bids 4@d, that implies no worry about 2 fast @s losers|pg||

nt|sybarra: great job Steffan,  thx @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to specs for joining us |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you too shirley :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: it should have been better of course, had N-S found the @d slam - maybe South's choice of 3@h rebid was off the mark - 3@d would have gotten the only real suits in play (@h was ...|pg||
nt|djneill: impossible)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d!|nt|sybarra: back in about 1/2 hour per my schedule |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: so everyone played a diamond partial. how odd, considering the number of times that commentators have noted the rarity of partscores in thios event (and country). one might have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that at least one pair would bid 3N with 26HCP & all suits multiple stopped. live & learn|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: pretty brave vul X with 12 HCP |pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: suit not good enough for 3H|pg||
nt|djneill: North removes to 2@c to accentuate the distribution, rather than pass and bid 2@c later - does not really want to penalize with such long @c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: pass not on the menu|pg||
nt|chick: pass looks right to me, after a 11-15 opening, and forcing your side to the 3 level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: canadian spec notes that the first speech ever given in the Icelandic Parliament in 930 is still on record: "How the hell did we miss England by this much??"|pg||

pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: you have 6 LTC and support for all suits and a pure hand for offense. if you pass E may raise to 4S on air and there you are cold fior 620 but you have to let them play 4S|pg||
