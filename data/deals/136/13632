mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: hmmmm what now?|pg||

nt|hedyg: welcome David|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, welcome back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ciao a tutti, bienvenuti|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
nt|daman: All of these players have names that would look good on a bottle of Italian wine|pg||
nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|daman: the systems are skewed at times so we will have to guess on occasion|pg||
nt|daman: so    if NS play a weak NT   that's what they will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: tah dH|pg||
nt|daman: dah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza way ahead of the field at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
nt|daman: obviously not a transfer|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
nt|daman: South will continue to compete over 2@H|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably will finish here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam woyuld be too much of an adventire|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a little danger now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: West luckily has an out|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Lorenzo LAURIA http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4849 top 5 ranking in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough|pg||
mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: Hi guys gl, Sergio BIANCHI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6328 and Ezio FORNACIARI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3599|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: it won't be a big surprise for me to watch aggsressive bidding & carding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Hi Geoff and Roland 4|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||
nt|daman: @D 10   suit preference for @Ss|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Hi all and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: hello welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is a match from round 7 of 9 - 16 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The player names will change shortly we think|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players are understandably a little bit late, because they were allowed only two hours for their lunch.|pg||
nt|athene: Hi good afternoon everyone...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Commentators in this room are Bill Frisby and Giorgio Mauri|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: the auction looks complicated here but it's just lots of fairly simple little things strung together|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: Two hours may seem a lot, but not when you divide by the number of courses.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: NS we always going to make 3@D     so they need to beat this 2 to get a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jtr: I heard about 3m showing both minors recently but this is the first time i have seen it used|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H looks like Kokish so forces 2@S, then 2NT is strong balanced|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: North does not have a lot of options|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the classification is LAVAZZA 130 ANGELINI 127|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the seven round|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|daman: still not home|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: then transfer to spades, super-accept, and so on|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: North had a very suitable hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: safety play for stiff king @D was laying down the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: If South's @sK was in @ds then slam is lay down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked by several specs how old Benito Garozzo is. He was born in 1927, so he is either 82 or 83|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after will be the last (8Â°)|pg||
mc|13|nt|bridge_one: LAAZZA TEAM: DUBOIN SEMENTA, BOCCHI MADALA, FERRARO LAVAZZA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 2@H as Kokish avoids the awkward 2@C - 2@D - 3NT start, where there is little room to investigate trump fits.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 82 I am told|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ANGELINI TEAM: LAURIA ANGELINI, VERSACE GIUBILO, FANTONI NUNES|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: he endplayed West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that I know of|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he is regarded as a native Italian as far as bridge in Italy is concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: ok ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: see 1@s with 8HCP|pg||
nt|daman: if my Mom had the North hand   we would be in 6@Ds|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: Il buon giorno si vede dal mattino (the good day can be seen from the morning)  1 supposedly good for NS pair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N normal contract, not much words needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||
nt|athene: Lauria-Versace play a relatively (for this level) natural system|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, less boring now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: North is going to drive them to some slam|pg||
nt|daman: guaranteed|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 2NT with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|jtr: Polish type @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The super-accept was needed, to prompt South into being interested in a slam on that moderate hand (on the last board).|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome aboard buddy|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S   is not on my radar|pg||
nt|bridge_one: D'AVOSSA INTONTI are new players, strong - Intonti is from Rome, D'Avossa played also in Lavazza team for many years|pg||
nt|athene: NS tend to just bid their suits in general|pg||
nt|athene: they do bid them at a higher level than many people, of course|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|jtr: Why 1@d then?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D was some bid on this collection|pg||
nt|athene: but then they make more tricks than most people|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play 2/1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D a semi-psyche if you like. He is NV vs V|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: age hasnt dulled his bridge awareness|pg||
nt|jtr: This is rather horrid for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: He will think the @dK is offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: might try to use the hearts via a double finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||
nt|daman: he will take hois 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: of course north felt there was too much danger his side was getting stolen from|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|daman: that's the sound on BBO when you claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a push for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Win @cA and a low @d looks sensible|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: both slams make but diamonds safer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|daman: I guess he could bid 5@H asking for a @C control|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike  and thanks for joining|pg||
nt|daman: or Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike, good to see you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening from rainy London|pg||
nt|daman: what should he do if he bids 4NT and partner shows 2 with the Queen?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: ah   my other option   asks for a @C control|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|daman: now   South should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: They are tecnically very good - so Angelini choose to play with best formation LAURIA VERSACE|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: Not what North had in mind |pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: something went wron|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: the dreaded fake reverse by North got them in hot water|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: not once did North show @H support|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|daman: and the got away with it     a @S lead would have been embarrassing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you wonder if 1@H-2@D-2@h-3@D is forcing |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: I guess N was a good hand for Fit Jump if such on card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: Declarer surprised by that @dJ:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To my mind, Benito Garozzo is the greatest player the world has ever seen. It's unlikely that that the future will produce another player as perfect as he was, and to a large ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: extent still is. In many respects. What a treat it is to watch the legend in action|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @S9 back tells North that he should hold up the @SA to preserve communications.|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk4: Standings after 4 rounds: 1. Lavazza 89 - 2. Angelini 81 - 3. Fornaciari 70   among 10 teams|pg||
nt|bridge_one: In open ROOM they are FANTONI NUNES vs ATTANASIO FALLA (from sicily) a old strong pair|pg||

nt|hedyg: @c lead in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: was played by E|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table N/S took the risk of advancing in hearts, which might have pushed E/W into the making spade slam.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12-14|nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!H|nt|cpt_hook: it the sicilians had this hand , an other 6 !!!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: At other table, South's raise to 4@H stopped West from making the same bid - to show an excellent spade raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N had bid 3@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: As always, of course, you can see the auction from the other table by putting your cursor over the Closed Room result.|pg||
nt|hedyg: W had opened a precision 2@c there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2@H system on?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: The deals have been great so far. Long may that continue! |pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: Nunes thinks 2@h means no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West does have the chance to show a great hand for spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H could be 0 hcps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Whether or not they had a misunderstanding, it is fair enough to stop in 4@S because the slam is a poor one.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although it is better than the previous grand, as a kibitzer points out!|pg||
nt|cpt_hook: 5 h seems a good save , but they are afraid to drive to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table North showed greater playing strength with his 3@H overcall, so it was clearer to move to 5@H (although still a bit risky).|pg||
nt|hedyg: he moved to 5@H himself|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Are we safe at this level giving pd 7 or so?" - no.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, ypu suspect Fantoni-Nunes will find 6@D or 6@H at the other table |pg||
nt|jtr: And may still be when you finish:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sabbatini team is in 3th position - probably the more strong formation after ANGELINI and LAVAZZA|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: but JTxx sets|pg||
nt|daman: well    they have other issues as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, got out cheaply for 5.|pg||
nt|peachy: both pairs play weak NT, apparently. Haven't located a conv card though|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club suit lies luckily for E/W, so 5+5+1+1 is possible for them in spades.|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W have 12 tricks in @s with the fortunate @c position, but it is not possible to bid it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: @S Ace    @C Queen|pg||
nt|daman: undo|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: or does that really show the majors lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weak nt (10-12) in action - fave vuln|pg||
nt|jtr: Tempted by 3@c maybe?|pg||
nt|henryb:  in my opinion|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H from West to show a great spade fit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: Nelle botti piccine ci sta il vino buono, well good things come in small packages|pg||
nt|athene: now we find out if NS know their methods :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Drury|pg||
nt|jtr: North i mean|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 just on the @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, South beat him to it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H from South performed the useful function of preventing west bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S forcing, so 4@H need|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sorry. I am in the wrong room. Must depart for elsewhere.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Bye David !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Lauria will pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he don't know (having void in @S) the reason of 4@H by Versace|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|chick: X is very likely a support double, showing 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria make this decision frequently . normally he guess !|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S from West I assume...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Hi Cornelia, welcome|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: then they defeat the contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - science is being used|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 5@H was 2 down, so 5@S is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@s is potentially three down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
nt|daman: now  it will make10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @d ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: if you assume diamonds are 5-2, vacant places suggests the heart finesse the other way?|pg||
nt|daman: fortune favors the bold|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: if the hand was all about the club suit, this is a position where south should play the @CK first round if east leads low|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: !4 ? :)|pg||

nt|athene: the double locates the @SA|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h I mean|pg||
nt|athene: then east has the option of playing for singleton @CK, and finesse the @C9 to pick up north's @C10xx|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: now N will be lucky because the long diamonds with the long trumps|pg||
nt|athene: @C10xxx|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: maybe, however QT9x also possible <my review, my opinion> just a1 HCP difference|pg||

nt|hedyg: 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: that system is played a lot in France too|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very sensible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so when you transfer with 5 M and a very weak hand you must play game when there is NO fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i personally prefer to play the opposite|pg||
nt|hedyg: stop low without fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but unusual to want to sign off in 3@S or 3@H facing a 2NT bid. The counterbalancing advantages make it worthwhile.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a matter of agreement mainly|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is important for a serious partnership to have more agreements than disagreements.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: weaker players (such as myself on occasion) would hasten to support|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h transfer, 3N apparently denying three card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@d and 4@H cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: The idea is you just give up on being able to stop in 3 of a major when opener has only a doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: not sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S i think a proposal|pg||
nt|athene: it makes game and slam auctions much easier|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, probably they use different gadgets (like 4@S immediatly over 4@C) - so 4@S probably cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is wrong, because of responder has, say, @sJ10xxx and a yarborough otherwise, 3@s will usually be a better contract that 2N|pg||
nt|drewsky: EW are the ten of @C away from being a decent slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 3N will be dreadful|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt depending on agreement is turbo or rkbw @C|pg||
nt|athene: yes, certainly it doesn't work when responder is very weak, but playing imps especially, people are prepared to give up on that to bid the strong hands better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: turbo is out, but many pair use turbo with @C suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea was first popularised in france?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Henry Bethe |pg||
nt|henryb:  I know this may be supposed to be Italian commentary, but would you prefer English to none?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will speak english for now (since my italian is horrible) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at bidding not sure what 2 @D was |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H was definitely a bit wet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about that....North might have shown some semblace of spade support at some stage|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|jtr: The lead was helpful but he would have made the hand anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: reason : if underlead by Q just shake his hand, opening leader didn't, then that's most probably a try to subterfuge for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I will have to figure out the bidding along with the rest of you.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know they have special system but ..... |pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand 1@d-1@s. beyond that I have no idea|pg||
nt|daman: I would play on @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: especially when opps are in the middle of an artificial sequence (i assume 1@D was some sort of relay)|pg||
nt|athene: you can really give them problems if you pre-empt before they actually get around to bidding their suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam there|pg||
nt|drewsky: It is useful to firm agreements after 4@C, for example, my partner and I play 4@D agrees clubs and 4@H agrees spades, etc|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  You lose a lot of imps by getting overboard on partscore hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Drew, it is usefull to have the agreements in this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: I am not sure exactly how good 6@C is here - you don't mind stopping out of it, certainly|pg||
nt|henryb:  Too good for Roland who likes slams around 12%, but otherwise pretty bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was more easy to make, but in bridge need to use the bid to know the possibility to play a slam, so 5@C i think is a right contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in theory that was west's fault|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: I would suspect it is around the 50% mark|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: If the @SK is on you will generally make and if it isn't you generally won't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: INTONTI is precise in cards playing|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is much too high. you need a favorable spade lie and not two club losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so probably his line will be the best|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: sooner or later he is going to have to play @Hs|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: I can even understand 2 @C,  but startin at 2 @D I am lost |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as we surmised, Fantone-Nunes found 6@D on board 2.|pg||
nt|daman: yes     to lose 2 :)|pg||
nt|peachy: an honorable loss:)|pg||

nt|henryb:  win the @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  cash the @cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  cash three rounds of @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is agustin madala from argentina |pg||
nt|henryb:  and exit with the @sJ|pg||
nt|athene: you'd be unlucky to lose two clubs - sometimes you might lose no clubs, so make even with the @SK wrong|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: (orginially)   |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: is there another option other than playing a @H?      |pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: the return @C to leave the ruff in @S is good, but @D are good |pg||

nt|sybarra: bridge pro might last longer |pg||
nt|sybarra: less injuries |pg||
nt|athene: but as a practical measure, when you have that east hand and partner opens, and opps are bidding hearts, you are asking an awful lot of partner if you get cute with control bids|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Jim|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|daman: both pairs play weak NT|pg||

mb|2C|nt|athene: there is a case for responding 2@C on hands like this South|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Olson|pg||
nt|athene: rather than the "obvious" 1@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play a natural bridge with many (a lot!) of conventions|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bid slam, or blackwood, or something that makes west's life a bit easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we talking about a hand only 4 losers after west opened?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Forcing pd to bypass 5@S to either control bid at 6 level or blast slam -- I'm with you, it was time to get realistic..|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what's the problem finding slam ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes and the small doubletons weren't even in opps' suit, which might give you some pause|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D  majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Should be able to avoid the @s guess here one way or another|pg||
nt|roswolf: the double by west was radical in my young days|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: or so it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome to Joe Shair |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think even east would ask 4N over 2@h could stop in 5 <worst scenario>|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@C|pg||
nt|olson: yes  clubs break  3/3  so he has  2 discards|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bal 15 count - heresy in the 1960's|pg||
nt|jtr: But will probably get a @d lead anyway|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
nt|olson: or they fail to lead clubs and  hand makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|daman: Italians cuebid  A  k  or singleton normally|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if weak nt, pretty frisky slam try by south|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl means interesting hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heart values were obv w opps, so even 11 easy to visualize|pg||
nt|daman: I suppose he might find the perfect hand 1 out of 1000 times|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S giving void/sgl|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: off 4 tricks on power|pg||
nt|daman: 5 tricks on ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whew, you had me worried there for a moment...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: It seems to be universal in italy to play a lot of doubles just to show a good hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: this will bring them to a grinding halt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Fortunately for them. 5 should make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very diffused the use of Dbl to give interesting hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk4: Unusual to double with 3-3 in the majors, but I think it's better than 1NT for two reasons. Partner is a passed hand, and Axx not the greatest holding for NT. Even if you disagree, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's hard to argue with the maestro's decisions; he has played a little before|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Nice little @S Q-J.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt was probably better by east to offer the choice of games|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he found a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: so i suppose if north had bid 3@H over 2@S that would have shown long hearts but minimum hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C means both controls (@D is obliged to go up 4@H)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D in North means Q or doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: the idea behind this bidding strategy is, if you have weak distributional hands you need to show your shape right away|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thik they don't use turbo - |pg||
nt|athene: with some strength you can slow the auction down, or try to slow it down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 4@h 5@C means almost 2 key cards and a hand with it is possible to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but not depending of key cards !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D by Lauria means that need anything more to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this way to bid need to have a great evaluation of hands by both palyers|pg||
mb|6H|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 5 is in jeopardy, but the 3c bid should help with the h guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: as I predicted    a @D lead on Board 3 would have beat 3NT    Fantoni led it in the OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually no real guess, since takes h out|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they lead a @S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: quite an effective lead though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: well always winner QTx/Ax , K with declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H is the card that is usefull to bid six|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say declarer guessed well @c position, still 2 losers |pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: Lanzarotti&Buratti once a very strong pairs, seems their ban lifted, however they didn't stop to register festivals as a pro pair|pg||
nt|daman: since North did not open a weak 2/multi    he is stuck|pg||
nt|daman: does 3@S show a @H tolerance?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple sequence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: they built up a system aptly named "nightmare"|pg||
nt|daman: all his partner did was overcall   and now they are commited beyond 3@H    which could be a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he has a collection shouts speak now or remain silence at all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does this pair play Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not opposite a passed hand anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bocchi thinking of stepping in?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D = balanced hand (or natural) dpending on sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s means balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: do we think EW stole them blind?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: i guess Massimo would try for a slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be. And double would be music to Madala's ears|pg||
nt|athene: EW do seem to always bid the next step up when they have a good hand, so it's some sort of relay system of doom|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C i suppose strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, no fear EW|pg||
nt|daman: bold as brass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: still a hope maybe Vittorio pulls |pg||
nt|daman: such a weird hand|pg||
nt|athene: lauria will fall asleep unless east bids diamonds, in which case he might double for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: nice lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems @sK lead would work well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala almost has best hand at the table |pg||
nt|santyclz: Too rich for my blood.  2@ds seems about right.|pg||
nt|olson: needed spade ace  to beat this one  , always hard to know  |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  what's this almost bit white woman? :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he knows he will be the opening leader|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  both 6@s and 6@c will make with the favorable breaks, but 3N is much more likely|pg||
nt|athene: probably 11 tricks here, courtesy of 3-3 clubs and the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: on balance    this is the best lead   because S bid 4@D|pg||
nt|daman: they have no tricks on the side other than trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but you know @sK already hooked, so why not @h A with p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case you score 3 trumps and hope a trick on an side suit|pg||
nt|daman: it's hard to decide if that is enough     you need 4 tricks to beat it|pg||
nt|daman: the peril is if North had AQJxxx       but then he would have opened|pg||
nt|daman: looks like THE LAW plays a role on this one|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: when your stiff @sK obviously hooked @h lead really passive, best to look for a ruff|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hedyg: too good for 2NT opening?|pg||
nt|hedyg: then opening would be 20-21 and this 22 +|pg||
nt|brolucius: A popular method over 2NT (or 2@C-2@D-2NT) is to use simple transfers at the three-level and two-below transfers at the four-level when you have a six-card suit and slam interest. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case 4@D would show six spades and slam interest.|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt from north now shows his hand perfectly well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess responsive double also an option|pg||
nt|athene: doubling when you can make a descriptive bid is a bit cruel to poor partner|pg||

nt|daman: is this really the Italian Team Championships?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: very nice guess with a fine reasoning|pg||
nt|athene: eight tricks are easy, assuming you find the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: the question is how to make nine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say as N you doubled, in case EW buys 1N that's Xmas for your side, if not still you can afford to buy it at 2 level in unbid suits|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really have a suit they can attack so maybe you just plod away with the diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you are 6421 |pg||
nt|daman: 2@S    -300   cost Angelini  9 IMPs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h4|nt|daman: very tough now      North has the spots in @Hs to staunch the threat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however @sA wrong placed|pg||
nt|daman: and Qxx in @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot continue @Cs for profit|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot play @Hs|pg||
nt|daman: and @Ss gives the contract|pg||
nt|daman: he is skewered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sKj at table prospects are not bright for East|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would balance Shirley. Especially at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Table feel I suppose|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: the defence can't organise to set up two clubs AND a diamon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|athene: either dummy's third club will go on a diamond, or maybe the diamond will go on declarer's long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: depending what suit west leads here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the defence don't have the communication to make the thirty @c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: now it is safe for Northe to play a @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: placed @c9 to his partner|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: duck a @C?|pg||
nt|olson: he  is probably unhappy with dummy   until he sees the majors  split and the club offside  :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can play A in @c @c but after no possibility to make the 3th @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play also @C and @c - @d Ace, @C ruff, @S @S and Q in @h to last @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  And how does declarer make this after a @c return?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not losing the @D|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting on @C return|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can *duck* it but of course he looks silly if it's east who has the third club|pg||
nt|henryb:  he wins the club and?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C return @c again...|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, no, duck is bad :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 entry in the dummy to discard a loser @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the best line of play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing small @d from dummy after the return @c is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has two entries to hand to use the long club|pg||
nt|henryb:  actually, the strongest defense is a @h back|pg||
nt|athene: west can only knock one of them out (@HQ or @DA) when he wins the @C10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @d and @H beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so @H return seam the best defence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy after @h by East|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so on a heart lead, does declarer have to find the club duck to endplay east?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays two clubs, W wins and plays a @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after @H return to win need to play small @C !!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays a low @d E wins and plays a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very interesting hand !|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can find this play of low club, playing east for the bare @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: he has to think what it means that east is worrying so hard now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: 1@h was transfer to spades, pass interesting|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: and another @c also|pg||

nt|santyclz: But what can you expect from an almost bit white woman?|pg||

nt|drewsky: Declarer should duck this trick|pg||

nt|jtr: If he can avoid it|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe double by North?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|daman: super weak NT|pg||
nt|daman: 10-12?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tiny miny|pg||

nt|olson: he does have 3  nines  :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: 3@S was not my choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and a funny superaccept, as i thought they will nicely land to 4@s, however @d lead will hurt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @c by south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, would 2NT be clubs and diamonds or simply natural? |pg||

nt|roswolf: south might raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: what are they trying to accomplish/|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: specs suggest 2 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Di Lauria forced Angelini to play 7, as declarer he did his hard homework|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i suspect they are trying to make surprises for us|pg||
nt|daman: 2 after this|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are all wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with one of my pards 2NT there would be 6@C4@d  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = @H suit probably|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: and we still have 3 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: can't really hurt to bid 3D on the way, assuming 3D is forcing for them|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good time to play 2s over 2h as a one round force|pg||
nt|peachy: This is no way to catch up, from behind|pg||
nt|olson: 120  prob  losing 4d and a club|pg||
nt|jtr: This will be ok i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D9 is a big card|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: this bidding is like a Tuesday at the club|pg||

nt|daman: hard to understand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

nt|daman: that is an undo|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am lost|pg||
nt|sybarra: but you need that agreement for sure|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ritong: madala knows at that point that @cs are not 3/3|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|olson: w could be  3334  here  |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: since west has 3 @ds and no 4M|pg||
nt|jtr: Now the @d is  8|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead looks natural if the double was lead-directing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Always a pleasure when your hand matches your agreements.|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partners are grateful when my hands are remotely similar to what my bids show.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 2NT unlikely to be required as a natural bid, so it made a sort of sense to attach a meaning to it. May not be the best one, of course|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|daman: cash|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|nt|daman: 2NT =  @S raise|pg||

nt|ritong: north overcalls|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|daman: South should bid 3@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: likely 3 nt  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7@s+2 aces+@cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dd solution|pg||
nt|athene: this must have good chances|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: in practice one may pull AK|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might be able to ruff one heart, throw one on @DA, one on @CQ and so just lose @CAK, @SQ?|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s now and will West double again?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt by north means long @c (can't have a bal 18/19, he would open 2@D)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D now by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Presume 1@H was a xfer to @SS.|pg||
nt|ritong: probably|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine so|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the first @H bid =spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: and now showing @H's |pg||
nt|olson: I would think he doubles 2 @S|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not need much to have a playable game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass is a option - i would choose to play in suit with void @C|pg||
nt|athene: an ugly spot but at least they aren't in 3 (as north might have been tempted to bid)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: this contract is not in jeopardy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now asking if they can play 3 nt |pg||
nt|olson: not  often I get a great  20 count with  nice pattern |pg||
nt|jtr: Some would use 2NT by East|pg||
nt|jtr: As 2 places to play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: as 4@d denied club stopper 4@s normal contract|pg||
nt|athene: hard to reach hand for the club up|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff is ok i guess|pg||
nt|athene: the mistake is to throw the club on this - you need that club loser to set up your tenth winner (@CQ)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: AKA Scramble|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d was ON here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: the other line is to throw the club and ruff two hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer doesnt have a whole lot to think about here|pg||
nt|olson: 2n by east is best to show  playable in 2 suits  or  lebensohl  showing  extreme  weakness|pg||
nt|roswolf: strange choice by east surely either 2nt - a sort of scramble was better here|pg||
nt|ritong: the maestro might express some disapproval about 3@c|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: it seems a concensus exists|pg||
nt|olson: w could be  1354 and this  works ,  but  game in H  only needs 10 tricks ,  and E was hoping  to  find a spot  undoubled|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Gulbis against Nadal at Rome now - very great game !|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c is no certainty|pg||
nt|olson: yes,  2n should not  be natural     scramble  is  common  treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice @sK by Madala|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: mind you|pg||
nt|daman: this might be one way he can make it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|jtr: Now dummy can be shortened|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: buckle up|pg||
nt|daman: he MUST hook the @H if they win Ace and another|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1set 5/4 Nadal that now go to service|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: a bit harsh to lose to the stiff ten :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||
nt|athene: usually you expect that if you get overruffed it will be from the trump trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they are working for a trick |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h J and claim|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: now @D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the initial return @D by Intonti was a perfect timing|pg||
