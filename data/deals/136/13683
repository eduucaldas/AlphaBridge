nt|nickf: looks like NS can eventually build a diamond for the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|nigel: With 8 tricks we will see if Brown can conjure up a ninth|pg||
nt|nickf: maybe he doesnt have the spots for a diamond trick so it could be hard work|pg||
nt|nigel: Endplay the Gosney|pg||
nt|nickf: East will have to keep all his hearts|pg||

nt|andy_h: Funny hand previous board. I think in order to beat the contract, East might need to discard the @HQ on his first opportunity of a club (after declarer finishes cashing a spade) so ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it prevents declarer in ducking the heart to West (danger hand)|pg||

nt|nickf: I think the team names are reversed. The Howard team are EW|pg||
nt|nigel: Assume double shows a single suited hand|pg||

nt|andy_h: E-W's leading style is 3/5 and after diagnosing that the diamonds are 3-6, and East holding 4-2-6-x, East has now a maximum of one club|pg||
