nt|bucheister: thank you Nick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: Hi all|pg||
mb|d|an|pass-or-correct|nt|nickf: I think there was a score correction from the previous set, still a good lead to the juniors|pg||
nt|nickf: we'll see when the official score is posted on score site http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/2010/final/anotfin.htm|pg||
mb|r|mb|3H|nt|bucheister: A very artifical system employed by Klinger and Edgtton; many transfers|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d multi - don't know if they could have anything other than a weak 2M and DBL is almost certainly "pass or correct" - wanting to play 2@sx if opener has spades, but to compete to ...|pg||
nt|janm: 3@h if he has hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bucheister: 1D showed hearts and 2S is a heart raise|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably RDBL showed a good hand (he certainly has that :)), and 3@h confirms that DBL was pass or correct, since he wouldn't bid 3@h otherwise. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bucheister: Sorry it is not Klinger but Gosney|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|janm: Klinger sensibly decides neither to DBL or bid more at nobody vul - I guess he's seen his partner's weak 2 bids before|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nickf: not a great start for the Howard team in set 2 - I am backing this to make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bucheister: Your are right; I had the wrong hand and player; interesting|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

nt|janm: NS will take 3 tricks, either quickly or eventually, for a very flat first board to the set (unless someone foolishly saves in 5@h in the other room)|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Jan|pg||
nt|janm: Hi Nick, thanks for inviting all of us to Australia|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi nick, specs :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: I have been told that takeout doubles should be taken out|pg||

nt|janm: Hi Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: the "kiddies" are having the better of this final so far|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: I was wondering whether Klinger-Mullamphy might use 2@s for a 2-suiter, but apparently this isn't a "weak" hand for them|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|itinerant: Justin Howard is 20 yrs old, Michael Whibley (ex NZ) 22yrs|pg||
nt|janm: That's great!!|pg||
nt|itinerant: In the other room Nabil Edgtton is 18 yrs old this saturday, and Paul Gosney is 24|pg||
nt|itinerant: correction, Paul Gosney is 25 yrs old|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|janm: North has very good holdings in both of West's suits and might decide to try for a penalty here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: It's certainly great to see 4 players who are still eligible to compete in the Juniors doing so well. Will we be seeing them in Philadelphia in October?|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: the four of them, along with Nabil's older brother Adam (19 yrs) and Andy Hung (22 yrs) are off the world youth Champs in Philidelphia later this year|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janm: I'd have thought Mullamphy was in a forcing situation here but apparently ot|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Mullamphy has probably shown an invitational hand with five spades now|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Roland, hi specs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The question is whether he is worth it opposite 12-14|pg||
nt|itinerant: hi nick :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|janm: or not rather|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|bucheister: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|itinerant: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Ed and John|pg||
nt|nickf: Juniors looking shaky already this set|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|itinerant: one would suspect a few imps will be coming back Klinger's way when board 15 is scored with the open room|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|nt|bucheister: Many play that a 2D response shows a minimum and denies 3S or 4H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|itinerant: one of australia's top pairs (sartaj hans - tony nunn) play almost NO forcing passes!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|itinerant: I think they make exceptions when they have made GF raises|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: I think this N-S pair plays 2-way checkback where 2@C is a puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|itinerant: Mullamphy and Klinger use "two way checkback"|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|itinerant: voila|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|janm: 3 hearts and a club, for making exactly - wise of Mullamphy not to double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hT|nt|itinerant: so, in this instance, Mullamphy has shown and invitaional hand wih 5 spades|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bucheister: What does a direct bid of another suit show?|pg||
nt|janm: No, I take that back, NS still have some diamonds to take, since Whibley can't get to the dummy to use the high spade and can no longer ruff diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Natural, weak|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H for instance would have shown 5-4, NF|pg||
nt|itinerant: the only possible way for this contract to go down, i think would be if Klinger plays on clubs for trick number 9 and Edgtton has the chutzpah to play the T|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D is the artificial game-force|pg||
pc|c4|nt|itinerant: klinger may then hope he has begun with JTxx and therefore may duck hte club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|itinerant: oh|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|nt|itinerant: that won't help as gosney would then be endplayed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: So now I can decide that Mullamphy should have doubled :).|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: So if you have an invitational hand with 5-4 in the majors, you go through 2@C (opener must bid 2@D) before you bid 2@H|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|itinerant: post mortem doubles are great, aren't they?|pg||

nt|janm: I do have some feeling that if he wasn't going to double 3@h, he shouldn't have doubled 3@d, but maybe that's also hindsight|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|itinerant: Can NS make 5H here?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|an|exactly 3 !ss?|nt|itinerant: it will be hard for mullamphy to stay out of game with that shape|pg||
nt|itinerant: especially since his partner is credited with the phrase "six-five, come alive!"|pg||
nt|nickf: that's what a reputation does to you|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem that the diamond losers can be held to 1|pg||
nt|janm: Wonder what methods Mullamphy has available here - must have had something other than 2@s or the 2@s would have been a little more prompt|pg||
nt|itinerant: if there's a gadget for it, Ron and Matt probably use it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|janm: EW don't really have enough to push them, especially since they don't know about the club fit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|itinerant: tell me, Jan, would you use 2NT in Mullamphy's seat as natural?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bucheister: 2nt id probably good/bad 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West bid 4@D?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: OK|pg||
nt|itinerant: now he's shown a bad hand with diamonds |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|itinerant: this looks like 690|pg||
nt|janm: This DBL is a little pushy - surely he didn't have anything in reserve for his 1@s bid vul vs not|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: I think this is an auction that screams for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's like  1@S  1NT  ;  2@D   pass|pg||
nt|itinerant: likely that dummy will be ruffing hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bucheister: strongly agee; diamond lead|pg||
nt|itinerant: just in time to take the contract -1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|itinerant: oops|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|itinerant: 4C, fit-showing, from East might have led to a better result for EW but it's hard to say the E hand is worth it|pg||
nt|janm: No, I think 2NT should be some sort of raise, as is 2@s and perhaps also the 4m bids|pg||
nt|itinerant: The @sQJ look like tram tickets on defence|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Sandra Landy of England had a Bols Tip in the 80's. Whenever the auction suggests a trump lead, you should lead one regardless of your holding, even from Kx. The trick will come ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back with interest |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|itinerant: mullamphy recognised the trump control issue and witheld from ruffing a second heart - the only play to make after the diamond duck was, in fact, hearts 33|pg||
nt|janm: I thought that showing 3 spades and some values was about all E was worth - with only 3 spades, he can't really want to force to the 4 level can he?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|hT|nt|itinerant: klinger doing a good job of stripping this hand|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|janm: I wonder if there was some sort of misunderstanding someplace|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: though he took whibley's double at it's word and played him for the other diamond honour|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janm: He was concerned (rightly of course) with making sure he didn't go down, must have seen some danger we missed|pg||
nt|janm: It must have been hard to believe that Whibley doubled on what he had|pg||
nt|itinerant: i think he was just looking for KQx of diamonds in the West hand after the double... and fair enough too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: You're surely right|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|itinerant: heading for 3nt|pg||
nt|itinerant: not an easy contract with these breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Now there's a 1@s overcall - with Klinger's hand you might DBL if the opponents got to the 4-level :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bucheister: interesting bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: good decision from Whibley|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: ... makes up for the last hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|itinerant: given 3C was forcing, Mull' could be certain he would get a chance to double at a higher level.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|itinerant: there's an inference here for declarer: Mullamphy must  have diamonds also|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|janm: Sounds as if EW play this sort of immediate position DBL as asking partner to decide between defending and playing - I still don't think he had it on the last hand, but it makes a ...|pg||
nt|janm: little more sense|pg||
nt|itinerant: declarer can get a count on this hand by ruffing a diamond or two - then the club finesse becomes a matter of counting to 13|pg||
nt|frankaus:  areturned making kiss |pg||
nt|itinerant: ah|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|itinerant: if strong enough to take the axe to 3C during a Game-forcing auction - why did he not bid at his first chance? ... only reason... diamond length|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|itinerant: .... come to think of it... xx KQxxx x QJTxx might take a stab at 3C and also pass over 2D|pg||
nt|bucheister: In my opinion the double just shows I want a club lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|itinerant: is this the double described by some as "i'd like to bid but you choose, partner"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|itinerant: or, rather, i'd like to double but you choose|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, South will be counted out for 5251, so declarer can play K of clubs in case the stiff is the Q and then a club to the ten to make this|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|itinerant: very dangerous to double with 3 or 4 club tricks and nothing else in a gameforce auction - the rest of the auction usually goes XX all pass|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe it's "I have decent values for my previous bidding, you decide"?|pg||
nt|frankaus: transfer X - i X  -  u get the blame if u make the wrong choice :)|pg||

pc|cT|nt|frankaus: ooopssss|pg||
nt|janm: Taking a moment to make sure he has the count right|pg||
nt|itinerant: too much counting perhaps|pg||
nt|janm: Always a good idea to double check before you make a committal play|pg||
nt|janm: Now he can claim|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sems he made i musta got something wrong|pg||
mc|11|nt|itinerant: had that taken place here - the score would be 840 or 1040 to east west - and in this case, North really has a hand!|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: With plenty of tricks in the side suit, the 5-1 trump break won't bother him|pg||

nt|janm: I think it would be 4 times as likely if there were only 5 missing clubs - it's even more here with 6 - there is only 1 stiff Q, but 10 small doubletons|pg||
mb|1S|nt|itinerant: note that if you had 3 clubs opposite the AKJTx you could catch a stiff queen and Qxxx by cashing the A or king first|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: board 15 was imps in to Klinger as predicted and we now have a 23imp difference|pg||

nt|itinerant: difficult for mullamphy to pass with this moster but he's shown his values already|pg||

nt|janm: sound 3-card raise?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|itinerant: this is a common situation: 1 minor (with 18-19 bal)  pass   3 minor (pre-emptive ) pass   'what do i do now?'|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what sort of preempticwe raise is that exactly?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is work|pg||
nt|itinerant: what's your bid with these south cards, jan?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|itinerant: indeed, 4th seat opening makes the previous hand another story altogether|pg||
nt|janm: It looks as if West in the Open Room had about the same information as Howard here on board 4; whether Howard's decision was better or luckier I don't know|pg||

nt|itinerant: heheh|pg||
nt|janm: Although I'd probably bid 3@c without 4 hearts; but then I'd have another club|pg||
nt|itinerant: howard making another wise decistion - 3S would have led to a bloodbath and now NS find themselves in a no-play 3NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|itinerant: we're a little slow down under|pg||
nt|itinerant: so now klinger's shown 5 spades, 4 hearts, GF, tolerance for 3NT|pg||

nt|itinerant: mullamphy toying with the moysian fit at the mo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF?|pg||
nt|itinerant: and pretty wise decision|pg||
nt|itinerant: two minor suit hooks, 4 hearts and a spade = 9|pg||
nt|itinerant: maybe the bloodbath would have been better ?|pg||
nt|janm: 3@s looks a little rich to me with 4333 and the K of the suit bid on his left|pg||
nt|janm: You're right about 3NT, but I'll bet Mullamphy is feeling less than hopeful at the moment|pg||
nt|itinerant: yes, it certainly would have occurred to justin in his teens, but now that is nearing the nursing home at 20yrs old...|pg||
nt|janm: At equal vul, surely it's more sensible to hope that partner's 2@s has already done the damage and not stick your neck out|pg||
nt|itinerant: mullamphy desperately searching for a line that gives better than 26% chance of success!|pg||
nt|janm: 26%? Where did that extra 1% come from? :)|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|itinerant: spec points out that klinger may have been better to redouble his vulnerable opponents|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "correct on the hand as it happens" does not = wise. if forces are not respected, partnerships rot|pg||
pc|hT|nt|itinerant: well, once one of the hooks works (50%), the other guy's 1% more likely to hold the other card|pg||
nt|janm: When in doubt, play your long suit, but it's hardly likely that they'll pitch anything useful|pg||
pc|d7|nt|itinerant: these guys won't rot :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|d2|nt|itinerant: it'd be 24% if both hooks were going in the same direction|pg||
nt|janm: Are you sure? When one of them has 6 spades? (or maybe 5, but still more than his partner)|pg||
nt|itinerant: pardon me, the other guy's 2% more likely....|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|itinerant: i can only see 8 tricks in 3NT - 2 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 heart and 2 clubs (previous hand)|pg||
nt|itinerant: if one tries to set up hearts, the defence has 5 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: I'm not sure about the timing, but you may well be right. I was thinking maybe they couldn't get the 3rd spade set up in time|pg||
nt|itinerant: whibley and howard certainly have gadgets here - if they didn't what's your rebid wit hthe east cards, jan?|pg||

nt|itinerant: well, i suggested they had gadgets|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: whibley was thinking, i think|pg||

nt|janm: Surely was Whibley, and presumably 2@h is some sort of good 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|itinerant: trump lead will make this difficult|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: i am not a fan of 4S. if the suit were hearts, maybe. with spades and a good hand, often better to mosey your way up there|pg||

nt|itinerant: some specs are sure the 4S bid did thte damage - i'm not so sure - i think West's double of 5H is insane|pg||

nt|itinerant: heh|pg||
nt|itinerant: alternatively, because he has a club to lead from dummy, he can always lead it, losing only 3 club tricks due to the short club honour onside|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|itinerant: fair point then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like the preempt|pg||
nt|poohbear: now we get to see what Klinger thinks of his partner's fav 1st seat preempt|pg||
nt|bucheister: why double 5D; it might go all pass; unlikely but partner will never play you for 7-5|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, the ruff was what let him make 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|poohbear: 4@d is quite conservative but devaluing the @c king|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Again, it's surely WHibley who's thinking|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: i am guessing E did not see the 4C bid & thought W jumped to 4D. of course even then 5D is dubious|pg||
nt|itinerant: The point often missed about opening 4S in third chair with extreme shape is that the opps get one guess (as do you - downside) and if they guess wrong, it's the 5 level and that ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: costs greatly  - I've seen many 1100 phantom style in that position|pg||

nt|itinerant: oddly it was east who pre-empted on this board in the other room|pg||
nt|bucheister: With all due respect to all; if you play 5 card majors then you must open 1C; just has to do with the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: things change in 3rd seat|pg||

nt|itinerant: indeed mullamphy shouldn't pass - but how to agree trumps and blackwood from here.... ?|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you have a subminimal hand then certainly open a good four card major; if you have a constructive hand you open a five card major.  The system is the 2/1 played by most of the ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: good players in the USA.|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps he should have passed the TO of 2@h for penalties :P|pg||
nt|itinerant: that was surely the right thing, barry|pg||
nt|poohbear: matt should bid 4@c here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|poohbear: Problem playing against multi is that there is no convenient Q bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: I think blackwood from the south hand is not outrageous now|pg||
nt|itinerant: the chances of being off SAK are not high|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h might be the right view . Besides 4NT sounds Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger counts only 12 cards in his hand, finds one under the bidding tray|pg||
nt|itinerant: yep, good point |pg||
nt|itinerant: for anyone unfamiliar with bridge finals - the trailing side my concede the match if they feel there's no chance for victory. it's not considered bad form|pg||

nt|janm: I enjoyed it too :)|pg||
nt|janm: What's your "magic number" for withdrawing? I always wonder about that. |pg||
nt|janm: Should we think in terms of IMPs per board? Or something else? Here, Klinger would need to GAIN more in the last segment than they've scored in the first 3, but a few lucky boards ...|pg||
nt|janm: could certainly turn things around|pg||
nt|nickf: OR has finished now, we'll find out soon|pg||
nt|itinerant: do you know the margin before the final set of the famous nickell team recovery a few years back, Jan?|pg||
nt|janm: Both of these teams are 4-handed, so there's some fatigue factor, but they are only playing 48 boards a day|pg||
nt|nickf: about 73 / 16|pg||
nt|itinerant: wow|pg||
nt|itinerant: well they certainly recovered more than they scored...|pg||
nt|janm: I think that one was over 70, but I don't remember the exact number (I know I got criticized for not showing it on Vugraph :-))|pg||
nt|itinerant: certainly would have made exciting viewing|pg||
nt|janm: And of course that's another thing that probably goes into the decision - the Nickell front 4 are very volatile, so their number is going to be higher than a team that plays more ...|pg||
nt|janm: down the middle|pg||
nt|itinerant: yeah - certainly i liked the discussion of "swing theory" in one of the write ups of that match. I believe the players tried only marginally off-center actions EARLY in an auction, ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: rather than making swing decisions at the 5 level|pg||
nt|itinerant: one kib suggests the Klinger team's decision may hinge on whether ron has lots of column material already from this match|pg||
nt|itinerant: cynical kibs :)|pg||
