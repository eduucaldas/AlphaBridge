nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||

nt|djneill: the @d lead was reasonable, even if led something else, the @d switch would be hard to avoid - the dummy was so weak in @d it seems unlikely West would have both the @dA and @dQ ...|pg||

pc|dA|nt|djneill: East should probably double rather than bid 2@d, in my eyes|pg||
nt|djneill: West's 3@d was preemptive - with an invite raise West would cue-bid 2@s instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: not my favorite pattern for 1 nt,   (5422)  but another rebid problem with out it |pg||

nt|djneill: 4@d, 4@c, 2 Aces at least, all South has to do is hold up a few spades to cut communication between the E-W hands, so might just make 9 tricks |pg||

pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: suit not good enough for 3H|pg||
nt|djneill: North removes to 2@c to accentuate the distribution, rather than pass and bid 2@c later - does not really want to penalize with such long @c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: pass not on the menu|pg||
nt|chick: pass looks right to me, after a 11-15 opening, and forcing your side to the 3 level|pg||
