nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, welcome back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ciao a tutti, bienvenuti|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
nt|daman: All of these players have names that would look good on a bottle of Italian wine|pg||
nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|daman: the systems are skewed at times so we will have to guess on occasion|pg||
nt|daman: so    if NS play a weak NT   that's what they will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: tah dH|pg||
nt|daman: dah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza way ahead of the field at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|flash: 16-board matches|pg||
mb|1C|nt|flash: probably in range for 1NT??   (all help welcome with systems  :))|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
nt|daman: obviously not a transfer|pg||
nt|flash: nope - 1@C it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
nt|daman: South will continue to compete over 2@H|pg||
nt|flash: with that hand, Duboin might well have been in the auction, irrespective of the opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Hi all|pg||
nt|flash: evening and welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably will finish here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: or is it kalispera in Greek?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam woyuld be too much of an adventire|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a little danger now|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Kalispera|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: West luckily has an out|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that 2NT was a game try of some ilk|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Lorenzo LAURIA http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4849 top 5 ranking in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Hi guys gl, Sergio BIANCHI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6328 and Ezio FORNACIARI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3599|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Valerio GIUBILO http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=739 and Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|flash: and that 3@D and 3@H show values in the suit bid|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes im up to it i thnk, only problem would be if they do something which conflicts time wis|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: it won't be a big surprise for me to watch aggsressive bidding & carding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
nt|fskoul:  For sure, but I think Sementa will just bid 3@S now. 4 would be too much with a bare King and 3 small trumps only|pg||
nt|fskoul:  No|pg||
nt|flash: but the lack of a 2nd dummy entry makes this too high|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fskoul:  For a NV game it asks quite a lot of things|pg||
nt|flash: the strain of Commentator's Curse, currently making the rounds, is particularly virulent  :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: Hi Geoff and Roland 4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||
nt|daman: @D 10   suit preference for @Ss|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|wygbe1: though its only 9 am here|pg||
nt|flash: yes, declarer could ruff out the @DQ and use a @C ruff to get back to dummy, but he can't pull trumps and do that before the defense establishes its @H trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk5: Hi all and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: hello welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is a match from round 7 of 9 - 16 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The player names will change shortly we think|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players are understandably a little bit late, because they were allowed only two hours for their lunch.|pg||
nt|athene: Hi good afternoon everyone...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Commentators in this room are Bill Frisby and Giorgio Mauri|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the auction looks complicated here but it's just lots of fairly simple little things strung together|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now declarer is doomed|pg||
nt|flash: and the hand without the trump honors gets to ruff the 4th round of @Ds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: Two hours may seem a lot, but not when you divide by the number of courses.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: NS we always going to make 3@D     so they need to beat this 2 to get a push|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: I heard about 3m showing both minors recently but this is the first time i have seen it used|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 2@H looks like Kokish so forces 2@S, then 2NT is strong balanced|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: North does not have a lot of options|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: the classification is LAVAZZA 130 ANGELINI 127|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: this is the seven round|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: still not home|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: then transfer to spades, super-accept, and so on|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|flash: a slight chance is better than abject surrender, but...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|hedyg: played by W in CR on a Q@H lead made the defense easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: i do like playing 2 @c as a natural bid, especially vs 2+ @c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mildredb: Meckwell play 2@D is MQB over @C & @D open so they can bid 2@C naturally over 1C|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mildredb: so many players are now playing 1C = 2+|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes so do i in modified Ghestem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|hedyg: this looks like -2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: but maybe only -1 if they dont cash the A@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 4@H was -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: S did bid a natural 2@c in CR|pg||
nt|mildredb: I think being able to bid 2@C natually is superior -|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|hedyg: here Bocchi bid 2@H opposite a passed pd thinking he could not hang him|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder what 2NT would have shown|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson, Icelandic team champion last week and member of the Icelandic open team for the European Championships next month|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||

mc|7|nt|hedyg: what ever for?|pg||

nt|daman: maybe he dropped the @D Jack|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Luigi REIFF http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20864|pg||
nt|athene: very boring 4@H+1 here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4@H just making|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2A+tr K|pg||
nt|daman: ca make a grand slam in @Hs if they bid it|pg||
nt|daman: can*|pg||
nt|jtr: Has he moved back to Italy?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 82 I am told|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ANGELINI TEAM: LAURIA ANGELINI, VERSACE GIUBILO, FANTONI NUNES|pg||
nt|fskoul:  I don't think Giorgino ruffed the 4th diamond|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: he endplayed West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that I know of|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he is regarded as a native Italian as far as bridge in Italy is concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: ok ty|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: see 1@s with 8HCP|pg||
nt|daman: if my Mom had the North hand   we would be in 6@Ds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Il buon giorno si vede dal mattino (the good day can be seen from the morning)  1 supposedly good for NS pair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N normal contract, not much words needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||
nt|athene: Lauria-Versace play a relatively (for this level) natural system|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, less boring now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: North is going to drive them to some slam|pg||
nt|daman: guaranteed|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 2NT with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|jtr: Polish type @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The super-accept was needed, to prompt South into being interested in a slam on that moderate hand (on the last board).|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: welcome aboard buddy|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S   is not on my radar|pg||
nt|bridge_one: D'AVOSSA INTONTI are new players, strong - Intonti is from Rome, D'Avossa played also in Lavazza team for many years|pg||
nt|athene: NS tend to just bid their suits in general|pg||
nt|athene: they do bid them at a higher level than many people, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|jtr: Why 1@d then?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D was some bid on this collection|pg||
nt|athene: but then they make more tricks than most people|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play 2/1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D a semi-psyche if you like. He is NV vs V|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: age hasnt dulled his bridge awareness|pg||
nt|jtr: This is rather horrid for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: He will think the @dK is offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: might try to use the hearts via a double finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
nt|flash: the agreement to use 2@C as natural over a possibly natural 1@C opener is quite rare|pg||
nt|fskoul:  4@H is a makeable contract|pg||
nt|flash: this can be beaten, given the position in the trump suit|pg||
nt|fskoul:  true, but the @D lead is far from ovious|pg||
pc|sA|nt|flash: i'm reminded that Ghestem is likely to be in use, leaving 2@C as natural here  :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||
nt|daman: he will take hois 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: of course north felt there was too much danger his side was getting stolen from|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|daman: that's the sound on BBO when you claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a push for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Win @cA and a low @d looks sensible|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: both slams make but diamonds safer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|daman: I guess he could bid 5@H asking for a @C control|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike  and thanks for joining|pg||
nt|daman: or Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike, good to see you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening from rainy London|pg||
nt|daman: what should he do if he bids 4NT and partner shows 2 with the Queen?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: ah   my other option   asks for a @C control|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: now   South should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: They are tecnically very good - so Angelini choose to play with best formation LAURIA VERSACE|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
nt|flash: now the @D shift may be all that's left?  but, no...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Now it will all depend on D' Avossa finding his way with the @C suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: Not what North had in mind |pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: something went wron|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|daman: the dreaded fake reverse by North got them in hot water|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: not once did North show @H support|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: and the got away with it     a @S lead would have been embarrassing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you wonder if 1@H-2@D-2@h-3@D is forcing |pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: I guess N was a good hand for Fit Jump if such on card|pg||
nt|flash: for North American players, Ghestem is a series of calls to show specific 2-suited holdings|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Declarer surprised by that @dJ:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To my mind, Benito Garozzo is the greatest player the world has ever seen. It's unlikely that that the future will produce another player as perfect as he was, and to a large ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: extent still is. In many respects. What a treat it is to watch the legend in action|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: The @S9 back tells North that he should hold up the @SA to preserve communications.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Standings after 4 rounds: 1. Lavazza 89 - 2. Angelini 81 - 3. Fornaciari 70   among 10 teams|pg||
nt|bridge_one: In open ROOM they are FANTONI NUNES vs ATTANASIO FALLA (from sicily) a old strong pair|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: why not 1@H   2@D   2@H   3@H?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: I like that too Geroge|pg||
nt|daman: another option|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: the object of the game of bridge is to find your fit|pg||
nt|daman: quickly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Somewhat difficult for East to find a spade lead....|pg||
nt|daman: yes :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so.... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: he was one of my heroes when i started to play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|flash: the attack on the @D suit earlier was needed to remove dummy's entry to the long @Cs, but....|pg||
mc|9|nt|flash: but the opening bid suggested the @C finesse...|pg||
pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: duck this?|pg||
nt|hedyg: in E i mean|pg||
nt|bessi2: on that lead the contract just got a little interesting|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: W with a very weak hand is trying to lead into partners suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: I was thinking he'd lead @DJ|pg||
nt|bessi2: duboin playing 2@s from the west seat in the closed room|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinking pd is long where he is short|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. i dislike that lead.. pd is perhaps most likely to have a long suit in hearts but is very dangerous to lead 10x|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: many prefer to lead from 3 cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... a spade lead or diamond lead look very attractive to me|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think the 3 cards suit is superior due to the 2 honors - pard needs less to have the suit run if he has length|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs to disc K@d|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: very tough|pg||
nt|mildredb: east may very well get himself endplayed|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you are going to bare K@d might as well disc it|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably should have said 'will'|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Are we safe at this level giving pd 7 or so?" - no.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, ypu suspect Fantoni-Nunes will find 6@D or 6@H at the other table |pg||
nt|jtr: And may still be when you finish:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: interesting slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sabbatini team is in 3th position - probably the more strong formation after ANGELINI and LAVAZZA|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but JTxx sets|pg||
nt|daman: well    they have other issues as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, got out cheaply for 5.|pg||
nt|peachy: both pairs play weak NT, apparently. Haven't located a conv card though|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club suit lies luckily for E/W, so 5+5+1+1 is possible for them in spades.|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W have 12 tricks in @s with the fortunate @c position, but it is not possible to bid it|pg||
nt|flash: 5 IMPs to Sabbatini on Board 17 - the optimistic game was avoided|pg||
nt|fskoul:  If D'Avossa believed the early play, he could see that East had shown 4 @S and 3@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: @S Ace    @C Queen|pg||
nt|daman: undo|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and the 2 of @D return could guide him to the conclusion that @C are 3-3|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: or does that really show the majors lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weak nt (10-12) in action - fave vuln|pg||
nt|jtr: Tempted by 3@c maybe?|pg||
nt|henryb:  in my opinion|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H from West to show a great spade fit.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: Nelle botti piccine ci sta il vino buono, well good things come in small packages|pg||
nt|athene: now we find out if NS know their methods :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Drury|pg||
nt|jtr: North i mean|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 just on the @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, South beat him to it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H from South performed the useful function of preventing west bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S forcing, so 4@H need|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sorry. I am in the wrong room. Must depart for elsewhere.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Bye David !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Lauria will pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he don't know (having void in @S) the reason of 4@H by Versace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: X is very likely a support double, showing 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria make this decision frequently . normally he guess !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a error |pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, either the double was penalties, in which case north should pass, or it wasn't, in which case lauria shouldn't double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C shows shortage i assume|pg||
nt|flash: i'd've thought that Sementa wouldn't sit for 2@C; he won't sit for 2@CX|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S from West I assume...|pg||
mb|r|nt|peachy: North has a normal diamond lead, IMO|pg||

nt|harmon: I though Sabbatini was playing in quail hollow golf tourney:)|pg||
nt|flash: asking West to bid the nearest thing he holds to a 2nd suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|chick: Hi Mike and Hamdi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Cornelia, welcome|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont know what 3NT means other than it isnt natural:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has supported hearts already and is effectively cuebidding|pg||
nt|jtr: It seems 300 specs have an idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt be suprised by a 6@H punt now |pg||
nt|jtr: @s value makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Daniela|pg||

nt|daman: a@D lead would have been something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norberto Bocchi interview at http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/2010%e2%80%99s-europeans-norberto-bocchi-talks-about.html|pg||
nt|daman: longest suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for your suggestions sorry i cannt type out thanks 300 times|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin bypasses 2@D, since that was South's opening call|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
nt|fskoul:  No double no trouble, as they say. |pg||
nt|flash: we've seen already that South is a 'thoughtful' player; here, he really has nowhere to go|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: then they defeat the contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - science is being used|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|po-s: winning bridge...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H was 2 down, so 5@S is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@s is potentially three down|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps North, holding Kxx of @Ss was supposed to X this??|pg||
nt|flash: the defense for down 2 is virtually impossible - low @C now for a @H shift|pg||
nt|fskoul:  These 3 card double are always difficult in teams|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
nt|daman: now  it will make10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @d ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if you assume diamonds are 5-2, vacant places suggests the heart finesse the other way?|pg||
nt|daman: fortune favors the bold|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: if the hand was all about the club suit, this is a position where south should play the @CK first round if east leads low|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: !4 ? :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: @h4..lol|pg||
nt|athene: but there are transportation issues|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still hard work, @s guess in next row|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|flash: low @D for partner to ruff, suggesting a @C return|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: the double locates the @SA|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h I mean|pg||
nt|athene: then east has the option of playing for singleton @CK, and finesse the @C9 to pick up north's @C10xx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: now N will be lucky because the long diamonds with the long trumps|pg||
nt|athene: @C10xxx|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin pitches a @H on this and gets out for down 1|pg||
nt|fskoul:  this is premature, since Duboin can discard his @H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: maybe, however QT9x also possible <my review, my opinion> just a1 HCP difference|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ace and a jack and a ten and a long suit - more likely to sit.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: Sbargia gained 10 IMPS on Board 17    3NT was defeated in the OR|pg||
nt|flash: now, a @H return would actually allow this to make...   trump seems best?  (@C also works)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  I think that even with a @S declarer loses trump control|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: loser on loser was a good idea|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 3 down with @D lead - but not easy to make|pg||

pc|hA|nt|henryb:  well, no, because there no late entries to West|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||

nt|flash: 1@H it is...|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: a slam on this one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: now a pedestrian 3NT or 4@S for NS|pg||

mb|2H|nt|chick: wow, I've never been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if they can get there after the opening bid|pg||
nt|daman: North should at least make a try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N can easy dictate|pg||
nt|daman: maybe South should have bid 2@D and then 4@S    unless that shows a different hand|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i guess north would read well and pull|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South will probably win the king and switch to a low heart|pg||
nt|athene: It's becoming increasingly popular to play 2nt - 3red - 3major shows support|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: both vul, any attempt by NS pair could be dicey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nasty guess|pg||
nt|peachy: North chose to show his 15-17.  |pg||
nt|daman: I would too|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ssh off record - play the King :-p|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@H what I would want my opps to do with N.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Is South related to Benito Bianchi, Blue Team regular in the 1970's? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Garozzo is East at the othe table |pg||
nt|chick: he's still not home, with every finesse off, should go down at least 2|pg||
nt|fskoul:  I believe 1NT has some "not natural" meaning, implying @H fit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: weaker players (such as myself on occasion) would hasten to support|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h transfer, 3N apparently denying three card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@d and 4@H cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: The idea is you just give up on being able to stop in 3 of a major when opener has only a doubleton|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa might've committed a Law-of-Total-Tricks raise to 3@H; it's surprising to see Duboin do it?|pg||
nt|flash: that would certainly fit with the auction, Fotis|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: not sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S i think a proposal|pg||
nt|athene: it makes game and slam auctions much easier|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, probably they use different gadgets (like 4@S immediatly over 4@C) - so 4@S probably cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is wrong, because of responder has, say, @sJ10xxx and a yarborough otherwise, 3@s will usually be a better contract that 2N|pg||
nt|drewsky: EW are the ten of @C away from being a decent slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 3N will be dreadful|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt depending on agreement is turbo or rkbw @C|pg||
nt|athene: yes, certainly it doesn't work when responder is very weak, but playing imps especially, people are prepared to give up on that to bid the strong hands better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: turbo is out, but many pair use turbo with @C suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea was first popularised in france?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Henry Bethe |pg||
nt|henryb:  I know this may be supposed to be Italian commentary, but would you prefer English to none?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will speak english for now (since my italian is horrible) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at bidding not sure what 2 @D was |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H was definitely a bit wet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about that....North might have shown some semblace of spade support at some stage|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|jtr: The lead was helpful but he would have made the hand anyway|pg||
nt|flash: several reasonable lines to get to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: reason : if underlead by Q just shake his hand, opening leader didn't, then that's most probably a try to subterfuge for you|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  I will have to figure out the bidding along with the rest of you.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know they have special system but ..... |pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand 1@d-1@s. beyond that I have no idea|pg||
nt|daman: I would play on @Ds|pg||
nt|flash: the location of the @SJ is favorable for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: especially when opps are in the middle of an artificial sequence (i assume 1@D was some sort of relay)|pg||
nt|athene: you can really give them problems if you pre-empt before they actually get around to bidding their suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam there|pg||
nt|drewsky: It is useful to firm agreements after 4@C, for example, my partner and I play 4@D agrees clubs and 4@H agrees spades, etc|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  You lose a lot of imps by getting overboard on partscore hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Drew, it is usefull to have the agreements in this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: I am not sure exactly how good 6@C is here - you don't mind stopping out of it, certainly|pg||
nt|henryb:  Too good for Roland who likes slams around 12%, but otherwise pretty bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was more easy to make, but in bridge need to use the bid to know the possibility to play a slam, so 5@C i think is a right contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in theory that was west's fault|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: I would suspect it is around the 50% mark|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: If the @SK is on you will generally make and if it isn't you generally won't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: INTONTI is precise in cards playing|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is much too high. you need a favorable spade lie and not two club losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so probably his line will be the best|pg||

nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think even east would ask 4N over 2@h could stop in 5 <worst scenario>|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@C|pg||
nt|olson: yes  clubs break  3/3  so he has  2 discards|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bal 15 count - heresy in the 1960's|pg||
nt|jtr: But will probably get a @d lead anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
nt|olson: or they fail to lead clubs and  hand makes|pg||
nt|fskoul:  2@C is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand and the decision to bid 1NT, rather than wait for a reopening X is reminiscent of a Spingold disaster last year...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  true|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|daman: Italians cuebid  A  k  or singleton normally|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if weak nt, pretty frisky slam try by south|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl means interesting hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heart values were obv w opps, so even 11 easy to visualize|pg||
nt|daman: I suppose he might find the perfect hand 1 out of 1000 times|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S giving void/sgl|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: off 4 tricks on power|pg||
nt|daman: 5 tricks on ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whew, you had me worried there for a moment...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: It seems to be universal in italy to play a lot of doubles just to show a good hand|pg||
nt|flash: this looks like a good hand to use for stretching, refilling cup/glass, etc...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  this lead will not be very unpleasant for Sementa.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: this will bring them to a grinding halt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: Fortunately for them. 5 should make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very diffused the use of Dbl to give interesting hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unusual to double with 3-3 in the majors, but I think it's better than 1NT for two reasons. Partner is a passed hand, and Axx not the greatest holding for NT. Even if you disagree, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's hard to argue with the maestro's decisions; he has played a little before|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Nice little @S Q-J.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt was probably better by east to offer the choice of games|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he found a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: so i suppose if north had bid 3@H over 2@S that would have shown long hearts but minimum hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C means both controls (@D is obliged to go up 4@H)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D in North means Q or doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: the idea behind this bidding strategy is, if you have weak distributional hands you need to show your shape right away|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thik they don't use turbo - |pg||
nt|athene: with some strength you can slow the auction down, or try to slow it down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 4@h 5@C means almost 2 key cards and a hand with it is possible to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but not depending of key cards !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D by Lauria means that need anything more to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this way to bid need to have a great evaluation of hands by both palyers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 5 is in jeopardy, but the 3c bid should help with the h guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: as I predicted    a @D lead on Board 3 would have beat 3NT    Fantoni led it in the OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually no real guess, since takes h out|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: they lead a @S here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: quite an effective lead though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: well always winner QTx/Ax , K with declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H is the card that is usefull to bid six|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: say declarer guessed well @c position, still 2 losers |pg||
nt|jcwla: I hope not.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you can see how is the way to evaluate the hand: step by step|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: 2NT by North was quite aggressive|pg||
nt|daman: yes Jim  5 is perfectly safe|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer can have a sigh of relief, makes now regardless of how hearts are|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @cQ onside, declarer should make at least 3@h|pg||
nt|flash: 3@C made N-S on Board 20; 6 IMPs to Lavazza|pg||
mc|11|nt|h_karluk: @h finesse fails, prospects bleak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still down|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem odd, but what other explanation is there for 4@S?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not exist a different way to establish the full in the minors suit|pg||
nt|fskoul:  there are certainly some points of the play that required a fast claim|pg||
pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: why didn't he open 1@D?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: preparing his hand for 3NT?|pg||
nt|bessi2: they probably open 1c with bal hands  1d maybe unbal/semibal|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|nt|bessi2: that's how me and my partner play 1c1d openings.. ripped from Italy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told many Italians play 1@d= 5 + cards or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: they play 1@d 4+ cards according to their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so maybe just being clever|pg||
mb|4D|nt|po-s: he wouldn´t let me go - breakfast was boiled water with some boullion - and Jan dancing cosack dances|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|hedyg: N seems to have shown some majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: but did S really overcall with just QJ@D?|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer trying to figure out what was going on in the bidding.. ns seemed to be bidding a lot for their combined values|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to figure it out, he must have 1 major and 3 @ds and 4@cs so doubleton in the other major|pg||
nt|hedyg: which major he has is a guess with 7-7 cards|pg||

nt|daman: seems like a normal result|pg||
nt|athene: i think  i have good chances to make 3nt as south no matter who has what|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well @DK more interesting than @HA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also true Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: The hands in this event have NOT been dull.|pg||
nt|daman: East will open 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Another slam swing on 19|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Slam failed in the other room on 19, so 13 more IMPs to Fornaciari|pg||
nt|athene: cash a top trump from hand first of course, to pick up 4-0 break either side|pg||
nt|bridge_one: xxxx in @S over the sgl is wonderfull for Versace !|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: now a goulash|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: i guess 5@d very hard to land but they may try|pg||
nt|daman: would we overcall 1NT with the South hand?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|athene: hand 18 was a 2@H opener|pg||
nt|athene: but this is 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i really don't understand these EW methods :)|pg||
nt|athene: some people might go 4NT with south|pg||
nt|olson: 5 @c best here|pg||
nt|olson: but 3n always wins |pg||
nt|jtr: Garozzo prefers to show his @ss rather than Michaels|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this might have been exciting but looks a straightforward game now|pg||
nt|jtr: Facing a passed hand it makes sense|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S is clearly better than 2@C (Michaels)|pg||
nt|olson: he may treat it like 5 4  and really wants spades  led  versus NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the vul is not conducive to adventures|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: un|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would rather bid 2Nt than 2@C   gets it off my chest|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get the reasoning behind pass of South|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that N-S didn't cash their @Ds, so they disappeared on declarer's @Hs - only way i can come close to that many tricks   :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: I wonder if N will double for t/o?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unlucky 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2N as you said would be a "nice" decision|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: Bocchi interested in a slam maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means strong bal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise 2@s (i suppose)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: defenders trump spots are quite strong|pg||
nt|daman: I'm not sure I would pass 2@C with the East hand|pg||
nt|olson: 2 losing spades may slow him down  and 2n rebid may be a minimum |pg||
nt|jtr: Madala interested in signing off asap:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however seems losers are 2@s and a @c with a working @d hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case East endplayed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or just play straightforward|pg||
nt|fskoul:  6@C could have a play with a different layout, but here there are too many obstacles|pg||
nt|flash: from West's perspective, the question is how many of East's values are 'wasted' in @Ds|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  2@h looks excessive to me, but ...|pg||
nt|olson: is 4c  rkc ?|pg||
nt|olson: prob  not|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C forcing (of course) and means or stong hand or problem in a red suit to play NT|pg||
nt|flash: as Fotis noted, the trump split and the location of the @HK would have doomed 6@Cs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: the bidding is a bit bizarre really|pg||
nt|daman: West led 7th from his longest and strongest|pg||
nt|daman: transportation could be a big issue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: problems|pg||
nt|daman: On Board 19     6 @H was -1   so 14 IMPs to Sabbatini|pg||
nt|h_karluk: besides timing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hold up twice is normal|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like asking how good pards hand is?|pg||
nt|sybarra: make a guess Henry how many pages their system notes are?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I agree, but people are raising after x'ing far lighter than they did a few years ago.|pg||
nt|henryb:  well sure, Shirley, but even 2@s would be forward going|pg||
nt|henryb:  350|pg||
nt|flash: (although North wouldn't have had a comfortable lead??)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now the @H lead makes life much more confortable for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d (instead 3NT) giving a not strong control in @H|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: given layout i think there's a need to hook @c J, but who knows, you know 3/3 break 35/.6 %|pg||
nt|daman: it would be hard to play West for 7 @Hs AND 4 @Cs imo|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid with the North hand   lots of intermediates and a good hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt seam not natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C i think not drury (or reverse)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a highlight reel set for N so far.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3Nt by Versace have a means different from natural bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: he is stuck in the mud insofar as communoication between both hands is concerned|pg||
nt|sybarra: but then they make their living this way |pg||
nt|athene: they have bid and made two horrible games and now play a good game in a partscore |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, I must run - thanks Roland, Hamdi, Bill, and all specs.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Italian open team for the European Championships in Belgium next month: Lauria-Versace, Duboin-Sementa (playing in the other room) and Bocchi-Madala. No room for Fantoni-Nunes. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Some controversy in Italy over that decision|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|olson: good stop |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|flash: South's lack of an entry probably got him away from a @D lead; on this layout, the issue was only one of overtricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|jtr: How was it decided Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: By Mrs Lavazza|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jtr: I see:)|pg||
nt|olson: the "golden rule"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: you let the opps push you around and you will not be successful|pg||
nt|peachy: what would be your bid, 2H maybe?|pg||
nt|daman: let's see what fantoni does|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: he can never guess West is void in @S     East did not rebid his 6 bagger over 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s discards was not a good idea|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: the diamond position is as good as it can be |pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  claiming 110|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|flash: no 2nd chance to lead @Ds through!!    :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: I think West now shows up with 4 @Cs    does he have the Jack?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still @cJ hook a must and hard to crack|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: he pitched a @C on the @S|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||

nt|daman: no   double in the passout|pg||

nt|peachy: yes, thats more like it. I misunderstood|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in case @c Q guess to correct direction there 4@h |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chick: transfer opening bids?  :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing like opening 1@D to pick off the opposition's 6-6 fit |pg||
nt|daman: 1NT by South      maybe they open 15 - 17 in first red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: both pairs were playing weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: 2@s shows heart support with a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h seems fine for NS|pg||
nt|chick: EW have a reasonable sacrifice in diamonds, but apparently they aren't going to find it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is why you should be able to bid 2@D natural against Precision players|pg||
nt|athene: interesting north doesn't overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 and an exotic flower|pg||
nt|daman: well   he has 15|pg||
nt|peachy: unless variable range, looks like it George|pg||
nt|daman: that's what I thought|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry specs, I don't have conv card to load|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if 15 is top of range, i wonder why n would act over 1nt|pg||
nt|daman: it has to be if North bid 2@C to invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: 5@dx-2 would be excellent in MPs|pg||
nt|daman: I think it has to be 15-17 in forst seat red Jim|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see, ok that makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s is a make with @s3-2 and both black suits behaving|pg||
nt|athene: lots of hundreds for NS here|pg||
nt|athene: they could have made 4@H with good guessing|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks are on in NT with Kx doubleton in @C also with @d 5/0|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S depending on style|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use 3@H giving the value|pg||
nt|athene: east obviously following some sort of relay sequence here - maybe 3@D asking for shape and 3@S the singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, if they don't bid game, you don't have to sacrifice|pg||
nt|daman: reached the normal contract the hard way|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of pressure on your judgement on auctions such as this|pg||
nt|daman: he will pick up the @C suit for one loser on this auction as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and it was different than last year|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now Board 22 gets even more interesting, we must see if Sabbatini will avoid the slam |pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  about 17%|pg||
nt|henryb:  does not have much choice in the play|pg||
nt|olson: it is a strong team , I think their record would get them a spot,  but you probably leave off this NS pair  because of less experience  |pg||
nt|jtr: If Garozzo had not bid it would have been tough|pg||
nt|olson: any of the 4 pairs  surely deserving|pg||
nt|athene: but it does look odd for east to bid anything other than 3nt over 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here anticipate a controls bec choose to play @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @d obv artificial forcing, 3@h stop, hard to reach game, normal result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pity there isn't a 0@D card in the bidding box - South could have opened that|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this will cause some difficulty   but he will still make|pg||
nt|santyclz: Both of the partners seem to have taken normal actions however.  They are both near the bottom of their ranges but the vulnerability favors agression.|pg||
nt|daman: East must be gagging|pg||

nt|athene: a nice no-loser club suit|pg||

nt|jtr: Fantunes have been a little off-form lately maybe but i would still rate them as worthy of inclusion|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, and it became more difficult to select the team after Madala is now eligible to play for Italy. He is from Argentina originally|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Luxury problems they have|pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i wish england was so blessed|pg||
nt|jtr: I am told that there was a possibility of Bocchi changing alegience|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|jtr: ailegiance sorry|pg||
nt|olson: try again :)|pg||
nt|olson: we know what you mean |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Use a different word I suggest|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nationality?|pg||
nt|jtr: allegiance lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: english with german overtones|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not convinced the @C lead is reasonable here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Changing his nominated country|pg||
pc|c8|nt|flash: perhaps trying to find partner's entry for a @C through was indicated|pg||
nt|flash: (easy for us to see that would've worked)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: he just wants to find the best line to make three club tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|daman: probably -300 from thin air|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n must have thought this is good contract for him, why double and let them have a chance to get somewhere makeable?|pg||
nt|daman: I agree|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: he suspected partner had heart length and would not complete in balance (if they played in H)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: declarer didn't have any reason to refuse @c hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just gifted a trick|pg||
nt|daman: Sbargia did not bid the @S game on 21  5 IMPs to them|pg||
nt|athene: well, this will work|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make 4 tricks in @c !|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: I am guessing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: type: 3@H=0/1 @h, 3@S=0/1@S, 3NT=5422, 4@c+ with 5+5+ in the minors|pg||
nt|fskoul:  D' Avossa was perhaps afraid his diamond holding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: an uncertain result|pg||
nt|flash: but the relatively normal @D play leads to down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: on balance    NS might have ended up in a Major partscore lol|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: seeing @cQ at table with AJx was wrong to pull A|pg||
nt|athene: north needs to be 100% sure his partner has the @CK to lead a little one there|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like a good day for you to go to the track, Henry.|pg||
nt|athene: seems strange not to finesse the @C9 there|pg||
nt|athene: completely safe isn't it? and why would north play the @CK there from @CK10x?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the J@C is reverentia for Lauria :)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and also was unwilling to try leading from J9@S|pg||
nt|flash: you haven't ruled out a @H lead (yet), Fotis   :)|pg||

nt|mildredb: yes!  when I hold them :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think it is going to be very difficult to take 11 tricks as they did in the CR|pg||
nt|mildredb: @H2 led in CR|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 2@H was led and small @s from dummy|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: he had lots of timing there|pg||
nt|po-s: it might not make|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|h_karluk: more counting - a must !|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is any signalling system yet invented that assures partner with 100% certainty you have a particular card :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: might have got uppercut for spade ten|pg||
nt|daman: I would not bid 2@S red ever|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i totally agree, daman|pg||
nt|daman: must be testosterone    or maybe  red wine|pg||
nt|daman: or both|pg||
nt|wygbe1: plus a vicodin chaser|pg||
nt|jtr: He had not played for Italy during 2 years so could change|pg||
nt|olson: Did Bocchi play for Spain  in recent years ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is a test of sorts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Norberto Bocchi has been living in Barcelona for some now. He has a Spanish wife and they have two daughters|pg||
nt|athene: true, if you do pick up the falsecard you get serious bragging rights, but still, seems odd :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: nine tops in 3NT for EW here, may be awkward to reach |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @c|pg||
nt|daman: washed down with a double rum and coke|pg||
nt|Walddk5: *some time|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He never played for Spain, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|daman: South will compete for sure|pg||
nt|fskoul:  no I haven't. But AQxxx with no spot is a very good alternative to the xx in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: Lanzarotti&Buratti once a very strong pairs, seems their ban lifted, however they didn't stop to register festivals as a pro pair|pg||
nt|daman: since North did not open a weak 2/multi    he is stuck|pg||
nt|daman: does 3@S show a @H tolerance?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple sequence|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: they built up a system aptly named "nightmare"|pg||
nt|daman: all his partner did was overcall   and now they are commited beyond 3@H    which could be a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he has a collection shouts speak now or remain silence at all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does this pair play Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not opposite a passed hand anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bocchi thinking of stepping in?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D = balanced hand (or natural) dpending on sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s means balanced hand|pg||
nt|flash: (hint - if you tend to always lead 4th from your longest and strongest, partner will seldom be able to gripe too loudly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: do we think EW stole them blind?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: i guess Massimo would try for a slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be. And double would be music to Madala's ears|pg||
nt|athene: EW do seem to always bid the next step up when they have a good hand, so it's some sort of relay system of doom|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C i suppose strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: yes, no fear EW|pg||
nt|daman: bold as brass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: still a hope maybe Vittorio pulls |pg||
nt|daman: such a weird hand|pg||
nt|athene: lauria will fall asleep unless east bids diamonds, in which case he might double for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: nice lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems @sK lead would work well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala almost has best hand at the table |pg||
nt|santyclz: Too rich for my blood.  2@ds seems about right.|pg||
nt|olson: needed spade ace  to beat this one  , always hard to know  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  what's this almost bit white woman? :)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Now if anyone knows the Sementa-Duboin system he can help us a bit|pg||
nt|flash: they haven't talked me out of leading the @HQ here...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: 2@C appears to be any game force (2 of a red suit requires 5-card length)|pg||
nt|flash: that's 5th, not 4th...   but gripe away   :)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  the @H2 is quite imaginative, but unsuccesful|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: he knows he will be the opening leader|pg||
pc|h7|nt|flash: 2@S the default call after the 2@C response; 2NT natural; 3@D expressing concern about that suit...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  both 6@s and 6@c will make with the favorable breaks, but 3N is much more likely|pg||
nt|athene: probably 11 tricks here, courtesy of 3-3 clubs and the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|fskoul:  probably 3@H must have shown @H length, so Intonti thought it better to try finding Hx @H in his partner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: on balance    this is the best lead   because S bid 4@D|pg||
nt|daman: they have no tricks on the side other than trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but you know @sK already hooked, so why not @h A with p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case you score 3 trumps and hope a trick on an side suit|pg||
nt|daman: it's hard to decide if that is enough     you need 4 tricks to beat it|pg||
nt|daman: the peril is if North had AQJxxx       but then he would have opened|pg||
nt|daman: looks like THE LAW plays a role on this one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: when your stiff @sK obviously hooked @h lead really passive, best to look for a ruff|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: aside from HCP of course|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you remember the 6@h called by Lauria Versace with the use of cuebid without RBLW ? 13 imp for Angelini !|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: declarer will finesse the diamond then run winners, hoping for a red-suit squeeze, i suppose|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird line|pg||
nt|daman: the 2@H overcall was not on my radar|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: about to stuff E in  perhaps |pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  Paunz can hold him to 2 by exiting with the @dJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: welcome to MIke Graham |pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: could have made with a small spade lead from handi think|pg||

nt|olson: made  4|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all. Sorry for late arrival - blame my web server|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: its ok you can blame me too   |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: HI all|pg||
nt|fskoul:  If we judge by the time we haven't seen a new result from the other table, we can reasonably predict that in board 22 the contract isn't 3NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: unless it was a lazy Tuesday afternoon at the club|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: we agree to disagree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c and S history|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: South has 2 suits   and you have 5 cards in one    better to lead trumps than to let them crossruff|pg||
nt|flash: the lead of the deuce from a 5-card holding on both the previous board and this one suggest that either N-S play 3rd and low throughout or that they lead attitude vs NT|pg||
pc|c8|mc|11|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|po-s: I have a feeling you are peeking - North could have the club ace instead - then declarer needs to play club from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mildredb: bridge is much easier look at all 52 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: as a matter of fact S not playing another @H seems to indicate A@c in !N|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|peachy: and I had Fantunes as teammates other table...|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|daman: would we open the South hand a weak NT?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this year played also Garozzo in italian champion team |pg||
nt|fskoul:  the Italian style is very often "attitude: |pg||
nt|fskoul:  but in the end we have another good result for Lavazza|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: weak N in action|pg||
nt|daman: halfway through the session and a 1 IMP diff    good stuff|pg||
nt|athene: but if you are going to reserbe the option of finessing the @S10 i suppose you lead towards the @SQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am just wondering how high NSEW can go now|pg||
nt|olson: 6 @h would normally be a great spot,  not  today  |pg||
nt|flash: (for ACBL members, the 3rd and 5th notation on the convention card is simply wrong...   if you lead 5th from a 6-card holding, you'll be giving up the advantage of the lead system)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: maybe 2N < dia bust >|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice hand East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *reserve|pg||
nt|daman: whoa|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are desperately unlucky to go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I have been worse *grand slams* I can assure you|pg||
nt|olson: 3 @h might catch a 4 @c cue|pg||
nt|olson: we know |pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure t least 6 will be bid in both rooms|pg||
nt|jtr: at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: tho obv stayman|pg||
nt|daman: they will get to the NT game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 3D i hope|pg||
nt|sybarra: and appears they do not play constructive raises |pg||
nt|daman: North opened that trash|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: no 3@C protection|pg||
nt|flash: either we have few, if any, ACBL members or everyone's in an agreeable mood today or no one's reading the commentary...   :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: 23/17 and interesting partscore battle|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from north now shows his hand perfectly well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess responsive double also an option|pg||
nt|athene: doubling when you can make a descriptive bid is a bit cruel to poor partner|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might think EW are in trouble|pg||
nt|wygbe1: these guys are hungry - on both sides of table|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm speechless|pg||
nt|daman: South will not stop below game|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding 7 would be 'lucky' here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is using up a lot of room|pg||
nt|olson: QXX of @D is  suspect  after a 3 @H try and he probably dislikes  3433  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know that's sort of a bee on your bonnet bid|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|daman: is this really the Italian Team Championships?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow|pg||
nt|bridge_one: look how both players use 2Nt for balanced stong hands|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now this contract is not expected to be very exciting, which allows a cup of coffee. Good for N-S to stop low, although the position of @DK allows 8 tricks for NS|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|daman: and  would lead a @C as East|pg||
nt|roswolf: never hurts to be lucky|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding 4 is even luckier|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: with 2 bullets|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ssh walls have ears sir :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vunerability is for... oh never mind.|pg||
nt|daman: with any luck    NS will bring this home   lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the contract is made because the loser @C over the @d|pg||
nt|flash: over a 1@D opener, a 1NT response tends to show @Cs; hence, Duboin's decision to look elsewhere for an opening lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: a @H lead would be the best|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|peachy: spade lead will kill diam entries and h lead open up H suit|pg||
nt|olson: e  wanted  to hear a 4 @C cue  and  decided  slam  probably not a good place|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: very nice guess with a fine reasoning|pg||
nt|athene: eight tricks are easy, assuming you find the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: the question is how to make nine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say as N you doubled, in case EW buys 1N that's Xmas for your side, if not still you can afford to buy it at 2 level in unbid suits|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really have a suit they can attack so maybe you just plod away with the diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you are 6421 |pg||
nt|daman: 2@S    -300   cost Angelini  9 IMPs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|daman: very tough now      North has the spots in @Hs to staunch the threat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however @sA wrong placed|pg||
nt|daman: and Qxx in @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot continue @Cs for profit|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot play @Hs|pg||
nt|daman: and @Ss gives the contract|pg||
nt|daman: he is skewered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sKj at table prospects are not bright for East|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would balance Shirley. Especially at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Table feel I suppose|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the defence can't organise to set up two clubs AND a diamon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|athene: either dummy's third club will go on a diamond, or maybe the diamond will go on declarer's long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: depending what suit west leads here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the defence don't have the communication to make the thirty @c|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: now it is safe for Northe to play a @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: placed @c9 to his partner|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: duck a @C?|pg||
nt|olson: he  is probably unhappy with dummy   until he sees the majors  split and the club offside  :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can play A in @c @c but after no possibility to make the 3th @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play also @C and @c - @d Ace, @C ruff, @S @S and Q in @h to last @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  And how does declarer make this after a @c return?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not losing the @D|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting on @C return|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can *duck* it but of course he looks silly if it's east who has the third club|pg||
nt|henryb:  he wins the club and?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C return @c again...|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, no, duck is bad :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 entry in the dummy to discard a loser @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the best line of play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing small @d from dummy after the return @c is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has two entries to hand to use the long club|pg||
nt|henryb:  actually, the strongest defense is a @h back|pg||
nt|athene: west can only knock one of them out (@HQ or @DA) when he wins the @C10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @d and @H beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so @H return seam the best defence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy after @h by East|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so on a heart lead, does declarer have to find the club duck to endplay east?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays two clubs, W wins and plays a @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after @H return to win need to play small @C !!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays a low @d E wins and plays a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very interesting hand !|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can find this play of low club, playing east for the bare @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: he has to think what it means that east is worrying so hard now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: 1@h was transfer to spades, pass interesting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: and another @c also|pg||
nt|daman: East will cash|pg||
nt|santyclz: But what can you expect from an almost bit white woman?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very dicey when your p more than a minimum|pg||
nt|flash: 5@Cs on 22 in the other room; 1 IMP to Lavazza|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|daman: making 3|pg||

nt|sybarra: and "only 50's"|pg||
nt|henryb:  good matchpoint score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C should make, by the look of it, so not much there in the end |pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: you think the catalan is bad just because white loses a pawn for no compensation|pg||
nt|athene: sorry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hrrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by South now|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt overcall is possible with south, but when your long suit is opener's, it can work out better to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Same as on the prior hand, I'd sacrafice the @H suit to accent the most positive feature of my hand and downplay my defensive potential.|pg||
nt|henryb:  surely 1@h|pg||
nt|jtr: Now a gentle 1NT i imagine|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is a possible option|pg||
nt|athene: double t/o from north|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with xx in @C i prefere pass|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: if north does double, south might pass, on the basis that even if it makes, it's not game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: :)   thanks Hamdi|pg||
nt|henryb:  okay, West 1@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however depending on agreement about the sequence 1@H pass pass|pg||
nt|athene: plus he doesn't really have an appealing alternative|pg||
nt|athene: and he does have decent defence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h now ?|pg||
nt|drewsky: I think most experts would overcall 1NT..I know I would|pg||
nt|athene: but the italian style in my experience seems to be not to pass these doubles even with qutie good trump holdings|pg||
nt|athene: *quite good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with Kxx @d and Jxx @C 1Nt would work better|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: lot  take out there after 2@s|pg||
nt|daman: as predicted   EW stole NS blind on Board 8|pg||
nt|jtr: But a hunt for the 7th trick|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, the 6th trick first actually|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|olson: he can play spade  to q|pg||
nt|olson: 3s  3h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can pass also at 2@d (not game!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure about all these three down vulnerables. Agreed, couldn't do much about it, but team-mates tend to be umimpressed |pg||
nt|athene: ok i assume we have this auction but starting with two passes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am adopted queen pawn opening, no worries :) i like to play accepted gambit there|pg||
nt|olson: but the 7th  not  likely|pg||
mb|r|nt|daman: come on|pg||
nt|jtr: He doesnt know about the @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: pull is very clear IMO|pg||
nt|daman: I cannot believe North passed that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he could bid pass, 2@H 2Nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is the more safe bid|pg||
nt|flash: over here, most would use a negative X there to show the majors and the 2@D call to show a limit raise in @Cs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 4th from longest and strongest will work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am unsure about 1@s by E|pg||
nt|h_karluk: operator, is everything ok there please? :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think we need two passes then this auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think West is supposed to start with 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: either that or they put the board on the table rotated through 180 degrees|pg||
nt|athene: that's most likely actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N off to a small @s lead or @sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -2, so 200+130=330 which it's 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but to be sure let's wait and see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: HE PLAY THE BOARD INVERSED|pg||
nt|wygbe1: wow, n must have loaded up on steroids before this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a direct approach from West, but one suspects it will be unsuccessful|pg||
nt|sybarra: this goes in the soup |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is a pianola hand    it plays itself       a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: NORTH IN SOUTH ECC...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 Imps to ew|pg||
nt|athene: yes right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: THE RESULT IS CORRECT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a breakpoint, match were tied 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: @S 2|pg||

mb|4H|nt|santyclz: But we have a (former) South American here, we can expect to be faster.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't think EW easily would give up|pg||
nt|athene: north in the other room never bid - 1@D opener did take some of the wind out of his sails i suppose|pg||

nt|olson: not  1 @H|pg||
nt|jtr: Pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|daman: gee|pg||
nt|peachy: some mixed or preempt raise,|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: light 1NT response - very popular these days|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2Nt superaccept xfert|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: N really does not have a bid|pg||
nt|daman: notm opposite a passed hand really|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: however, 2@S was not what North had in mind |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose pass to 1@h <unless otherwise stated in sys card>|pg||
nt|athene: super-accept leads to easy 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: correct Joe, always a joy to comment on the So. American vugraph,  it is at sprint speed |pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like seven tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fskoul:  4@S is reasonable to bid, but when dummy goes dummy you always wish you could avoid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: very light responses can work well in a strong club system, where there is a strong likelihood that it is EW's hand - you amke it difficult for them to come in |pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: good news you can finesse to @sJ, bad news but which direction :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: they could have bought this in 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: and now they have to struggle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very much|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still threats to ruff 3rd @h|pg||
nt|daman: Sabbatini    retakes the lead    they won 6 on  24    played in the normal 2@S   they we in 4@H -3 at this table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oy|pg||
nt|daman: this is like a ping pong match|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think maximum with 4 cards|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|daman: vey|pg||
nt|athene: EW can go for the four obvious tricks (spade, some aces, @C ruff)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h over 2@d would be 4 cards raise minimum|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: here, obviously, it hasn't worked so well |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bad pass and bad lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: but one board doesn't prove anything.|pg||
nt|peachy: with a singl diam, he might|pg||
nt|athene: good lead, otherwise declarer might have time to set up a spade for the club pitch and 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: wah wah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however West still dominates|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|flash: any of the specs have an answer to the last-round match-ups?|pg||
nt|flash: not yet played, i'm told|pg||
nt|fskoul:  The Italians usually use a "delayed" RR system, which "shufles" the rounds in order to delay the match between the two leading teams|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  although an eighth is available in @d|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine the operator is trying to ctach up|pg||
nt|jtr: catch|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: he is trying for the @D trick |pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: uh oh west quit to have a @h ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, he is trying for a ruff|pg||
nt|daman: nah   he needed to hear 3@D from South before he would consider game|pg||

nt|athene: i imagine they will play 6@H, although 6nt is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: 4 more hands  for Fornaciari tem to even up the score|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and that was 2 way, somehow inspired|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be fun |pg||
nt|athene: if you have oodles of HCP and two trick sources, you sometimes want to play in notrumps because then even if one suit breaks badly you survive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both finesses are onside|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|daman: they will not get to the cold slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for NS |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|athene: but if that's your trump suit with two losers, it doesn't matter if you have 15 winners elsewhere|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S some kind of diamond raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h singleton?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: again 2 way finesse , this time @h suit|pg||
nt|daman: they have lost the @D suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: another flat 3nt?|pg||
nt|jtr: 25 was flat but not in the way we originally imagined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: in North America    we ipen the South hand 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: either 6@h+3@c+1@d+3@s or finesse to @d K brings 13 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: as a general game-force?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic |pg||
nt|fskoul:  now a lead problem for East|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: Board 25 in as a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: they have got quite high under their own steam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA lead would be very friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have good vlaues, so perhaps it is unrealistic for them to stop low |pg||
nt|daman: open*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tartan 2?|pg||
nt|sybarra: madala in with 3 @s is my guess |pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he wants to bid 4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: stayman or transfer than new suit GF|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: opening 1@C seems weird to me|pg||
nt|jtr: It would seem so Geoff|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S obviously something cunning|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: 1@d ok here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|fskoul:  the seemingly "safe" 9 @D lead allows declarer to establish 3 diamonds tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: Angelini might cash, knowing his partner is broke, well see|pg||
nt|peachy: even if he doesnt, just overtrick or two at stake.  But he cant realisticlaly expect his partner to have an entry in this auction|pg||
nt|wygbe1: working this hard with one imp at stake, down 27, not really energy efficient|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like the modern puppet stayman idea|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H = no major|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 3@S to force 3nt, but if he bid 3nt right away , that would be 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|drewsky: Declarer should duck this trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you play it that way round (rather than responder's 3@S = 5-4 majors) to rightside a possible 4@S contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|jtr: @sK relieves any problems|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: so I do not go to track to day |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|athene: if 4NT was RKCB then 5NT asked for kings, so 6@D looks like one side king - but showing just the number of kings isn't much use so i can't believe that's what they are doing|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another breakpoijnt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: Nor I.  I never expected a pass.|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now declarer has 6 tricks, but it is very unlikely to find a 7th|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: making 5   if they cash the @S    doink|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *breakpoint|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though south thought 6@D=@DK|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just works out the grand might be excellent and at worst will be on a finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mega difference of Di Lauria - world grandmasters ranking top 4 <best placing points owner> a living saga!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: i think he thought 3N disaster, then pushed|pg||
nt|athene: three options:- a) finesse @D (works)  b) finesse @S (works) c) play for @S-@D squeeze (doesn't work)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you might try to ruff the diamonds good as well|pg||
nt|athene: (throw dummy's diamond on the @CQ and ruff a diamond or two)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Tutte le strade portano a Roma (All roads lead to Rome)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: The Law says to bid 3@s (nine trumps) but maybe with his soft values he was afraid EW might bid a missed game|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: super weak NT|pg||
nt|daman: 10-12?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tiny miny|pg||

nt|mdgraham: now, would 2NT be clubs and diamonds or simply natural? |pg||

nt|roswolf: south might raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: what are they trying to accomplish/|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: specs suggest 2 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Di Lauria forced Angelini to play 7, as declarer he did his hard homework|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: i suspect they are trying to make surprises for us|pg||
nt|daman: 2 after this|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are all wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with one of my pards 2NT there would be 6@C4@d  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = @H suit probably|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: and we still have 3 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: can't really hurt to bid 3D on the way, assuming 3D is forcing for them|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good time to play 2s over 2h as a one round force|pg||
nt|peachy: This is no way to catch up, from behind|pg||
nt|olson: 120  prob  losing 4d and a club|pg||
nt|jtr: This will be ok i guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D9 is a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this bidding is like a Tuesday at the club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one thing for sure, they all know bluff bids|pg||
nt|daman: hard to understand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: standard lead (small from xxx)|pg||
nt|flash: evidently another systemic agreement which differs from the 'std' approach|pg||
nt|fskoul:  3NT are extremely "stone-cold"|pg||

nt|santyclz: My partners are grateful when my hands are remotely similar to what my bids show.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 2NT unlikely to be required as a natural bid, so it made a sort of sense to attach a meaning to it. May not be the best one, of course|pg||
nt|flash: since losing the lead to North is the only way to endanger the contract, declarer plays @Ds this way...|pg||

nt|flash: the passive return of either minor will avoid giving up an extra overtrick|pg||

nt|fskoul:  He could of course duck a @D to South without first cashing @DK, which in this case would have gained an extra trick|pg||

nt|olson: 2n by east is best to show  playable in 2 suits  or  lebensohl  showing  extreme  weakness|pg||
nt|roswolf: strange choice by east surely either 2nt - a sort of scramble was better here|pg||
nt|ritong: the maestro might express some disapproval about 3@c|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think this is their way to sign off in 2@H, as opposed to suggesting going on|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems a concensus exists|pg||
nt|olson: w could be  1354 and this  works ,  but  game in H  only needs 10 tricks ,  and E was hoping  to  find a spot  undoubled|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: while this is playing out...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: Gulbis against Nadal at Rome now - very great game !|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c is no certainty|pg||
nt|olson: yes,  2n should not  be natural     scramble  is  common  treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice @sK by Madala|pg||
pc|h8|nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Daniela Nante, for a great job!!!|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the FIGB, and particularly Gianluca Frola, for their sponsorship of this event|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fskoul:  I believe 2@C was some kind of forcing bid, requiring a 2@D response, and then 2@H shows an inv hand with 5 @H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|daman: mind you|pg||
nt|daman: this might be one way he can make it|pg||
nt|flash: and to the organizers, particularly Vincenzo Delle Cave, for inviting us to participate|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|jtr: Now dummy can be shortened|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: buckle up|pg||
nt|daman: he MUST hook the @H if they win Ace and another|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1set 5/4 Nadal that now go to service|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is always how to get back to hand safely|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: easy now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|flash: 2-way new minor forcing...   cross-eyedness has set in!!!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: wd|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: a bit harsh to lose to the stiff ten :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||
nt|athene: usually you expect that if you get overruffed it will be from the trump trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they are working for a trick |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: @h J and claim|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @D|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: so the initial return @D by Intonti was a perfect timing|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: several specs are of course pointing out he didn't need to ruff the heart that east played into his @HAQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|wygbe1: notice declarer's failure to lead the 9 on first round of spades left him poorly placed to finesse against south's spade jack - since suit blocked|pg||
mc|9|nt|flash: Angelini's gained a few IMPs (and a few VPs) - Lavazza now ahead by 3|pg||

nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|h_karluk: last board|pg||

nt|wygbe1: hardly a big deal, but an example of building good habits|pg||

nt|olson: 3n makes  ,  4h  off  500|pg||
nt|olson: 300|pg||
nt|fskoul:  very impressive end position. Now a club is ducked to North|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: same here|pg||
nt|daman: what happened to the 1@D opener?|pg||
nt|daman: 5@Ds and Kx of @Cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the hand we begin with 1@d|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, i was in the middle of dinner, and missed approximately 90% of the interest in the play of that hand :) but it does seem declarer was a bit mad if that was indeed how it ...|pg||
nt|athene: went|pg||
nt|wygbe1: lucky slam possible here, in h, clubs or nt|pg||
nt|olson: down  22|pg||
nt|olson: 2|pg||
nt|flash: last board now...   thnx for your help this session, Fotis; thnx, specs, for trying to keep us on the straight and narrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes another potential feisty hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   and http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php also http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all are very nice ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tools for you to enjoy more|pg||
nt|daman: inverted|pg||
nt|olson: 3n  would be a great  result  ew|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt and 5@C are ON for N/S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx Daniela  our terrific operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to my co-co's Henry, Joe and Mike   great fun guys |pg||
nt|jtr: X or @hs?|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and he has to either return a @C in the teenace, or concede a ruff and discard|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: don't see that North can do much over this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d minimum 2Down Vulnerable, so no good defence|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: given layout 4@d very easy for EW|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yup rt|pg||
nt|jtr: Will Garozzo try 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means very strong one suit hand in @c|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt like north's a moment ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs whose comments keep us on the straight and narrow |pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess 1@S was F|pg||
nt|wygbe1: so ew were presented with two chances for large pickups by bidding grands - admittedly the second one incredibly lucky|pg||
nt|jtr: Nope went gently|pg||
nt|athene: but still hard for Lauria to find 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and not balanced ! (otherwise would open 2@D)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|daman: well done|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you for the last round of this competition and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: North has to bid 3@S now, I guess - not sure of the ramifications here |pg||
nt|athene: this won't take long|pg||
nt|athene: not once the @SQ appears anyway|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Daniela, Jordan, William, good work|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: good decision|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|olson: he wanted  KQx  of  @H |pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe not that hard|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@C great card, sufficient to call game|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: auto -1, aggressive try|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his @CA is worth about 10 hcp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: not match ponts so this is not the worse spot |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@S makes|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps they aware of approx standing and didnt fight much|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: I wonder what is going through his mind?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: God knows:)|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the @D 9?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, bye for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure when we are back  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|olson: a calm  130  here to end the set|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 110|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: should think stolen fruit has a special flavor|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: previous hand 3@D by N/S, so swing for Sabbatini|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1@D - so start small @C from South need (very hard to find Qxx in West after the overcall 1@D)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ty all for watching !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here will continue with other time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: last turn tomorrow in the morning|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BYE ! |pg||
nt|flash: the big match-up of Angelini vs Lavazza scheduled for tomorrow - in just under 15 hours|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|daman: now he makes the rest|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fskoul:  2@C will lose 3 trump tricks and 1 trick in each major, but a good result for EW|pg||
nt|flash: double-partial swing again on Board 28, extending the lead|pg||
mc|8|nt|flash: off to the Open Room; thnx again|pg||
