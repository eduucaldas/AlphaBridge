nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: question in my mind is do you only bid 3 @c with N |pg||
nt|andyv:  both sides can make 3 level contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i like the idea of sending that message, but maybe the message that will actually be perceived i: "i will bid whatever i want whenever i want without regard to partner, so dont ...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|peachy: also helps that help was not needed to make, this time...|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s won't make, but if it's only -1 and undoubled perhaps it was worth the risk|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dQ|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and likely to take the @D finesse |pg||

pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|peachy: This one needs the misdef factor, but they arent getting it, spade lead prob coming|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|djneill: no system card, but it appears East opened a swedish/polish/strong @c, and now West has enough to act (not sure why didn't act over 1@s)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make S play the trump suit  from the top |pg||

nt|yuval10: nowadays many players tend to lead a major after the 1NT-3NT sequence, sometimes even with 5 cards minor suit in their hand|pg||

nt|friggi: it is|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: necessary if N had AQT of Ds|pg||
nt|djneill: so, 2@c game force 5+@c, 2@h 5+@h, 3@h fit, East cue-bids to be courteous, as does West, and both realize they are both minimum after 4@h|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: and this is a winning position also|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|djneill: East's 4@c bypassed 3@s, so East does not have a @s control - so when West cue-bids 4@d, that implies no worry about 2 fast @s losers|pg||

pc|hT|nt|djneill: South did quite well not to lead @d, but perhaps the fact that North did not double the 4 @d cue-bid was a negative inference (if North had good @d might ahve doubled 4@d)|pg||
