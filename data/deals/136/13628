mb|d|nt|hoffers: And last board will help|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Side note - the correct play in the @h suit depends on how many tricks you need to take - if you need 5, as Gumby did, @hA first is correct as David pointed out|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|benjent: if you need 6 tricks, @h to the J is correct (picks up KQx onside with 10x offside)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: inv raise|pg||
nt|hoffers: 4 spades is the best contract for NS, but will they get there?|pg||
nt|benjent: Is 2@d a reverse for you Hoffers?|pg||
nt|hoffers: Not in this sequence|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 6 can make |pg||
nt|sybarra: but that is really pushy by E |pg||
nt|othered1: Makes it luckily.  From here, serves north right for riling things up with an unsound preempt.|pg||
nt|bucheister: ????|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear CW have stole this one blind|pg||
nt|olson: 5/0  clubs reduces it slightly from 75%|pg||
nt|olson: and now it makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  or intermediate actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this is the 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome to Henry Bethe   USA|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@C?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as bough NS and EW use @C as +2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bet its 5 @S |pg||
nt|rodal f: And W now for inverted.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a shame with 4 nice D vs 106 @C|pg||
nt|hoffers: May come to a stop here|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT alerted.What is it vug:)|pg||
nt|olson: west is worth at least a Quant 4N  or a club slam try if available  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: min opener I expect 2 suits stopped|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 2club showed 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS will lose 1 imp and be happy it's not a lot more|pg||
nt|benjent: Not for me either. Maybe Walsh-McDonald do play it as a reverse, which some pairs do|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure N played a @s?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugrapha2: it was 5c|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: what ever that is |pg||
nt|bucheister: new system|pg||
nt|olson: East could be worse,  3.5 quick tricks should cooperate on a slam try  |pg||
nt|olson: he may think E  had  4h|pg||
nt|benjent: Ooh - nice try by Walsh to back into 4@s. McDonald wasn't buying today|pg||
pc|h7|nt|olson: either the club or NT slam is a nice result if they can reach it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes having shown min Robert is now big|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still I wonder by the 2NT bid and the alerted meaning.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: conventional double with one trick?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am getting dizzy|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@c is on the same @s guess as 3NT and 4@s ... but without the game bonus|pg||
nt|hoffers: At least they have stopped in a making contract, but I think Alan will mispick spades|pg||
nt|benjent: Maybe - Lazer is going to show up with 12 points by the time he has to pick the @s's|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hoffers: So much for predictions!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|olson: what is the EW system ?|pg||

nt|andyv:  who cares?|pg||
nt|andyv:  something was wrong |pg||
nt|olson: and losing the spade ace and  3h  to claim not caring about club king|pg||
nt|andyv:  N had 9 tricks|pg||
nt|olson: we knew he had 9 tricks  by finessing the club|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2H|mb|2S!|nt|benjent: There's a dodgy - and not technically making - 3NT for EW here. Can Lazer-Gumby draw first blood?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: Do they play 'kickback" where 4@S might be the asking bid, so 4N was takens as @S cue?|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hAQxxxx is contagious|pg||
mb|4S|nt|olson: it is unlikely that e  had  5s! and 4h1  from the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 5@h looked like it was from 5 card suit (where's the 4)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the team result showing is of no concern as this is a butler and it only reflects one random result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CW have had a good set though|pg||
nt|hoffers: Thus, C/W will pick up on the previous board, but not 11imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: They bid all of 1N in the OR with north's hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3not not arlerted but explained as a balanced GF raise|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is a great contract and a surprising one|pg||
nt|othered1: That's really ugly|pg||
nt|olson: agreed |pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra: its not matchpoints  |pg||
nt|othered1: 41H by south could be in trouble with a @D lead, even though it's not all that likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1Nt 6-9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hopeless for NS to defeet this but a IMP can bee gained.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C still +2 I belive|pg||
nt|benjent: Bit short on points and fit, so Lazer would probably have to be the one to push the boat out|pg||
nt|benjent: Vague prospect for making is: @h lead (they break 4-4), so you win the A and take the @d finesse|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  oh well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: after a club lead,  declarer needs to decide if he should finesse the h or the spade  after losing a diamond|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = 4+ and 6+ on cc|pg||
nt|hoffers: The club lead knocks out Paul's only certain entry, so limiting his options in diamonds|pg||
nt|olson: we know to run the spade jack  |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least makes the match much tighter|pg||
nt|benjent: Give Gumby a @d card, and she would have tried 3NT, and it would have then been a goodish contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|olson: yes,  win some lose some :)|pg||
nt|olson: the  reason we all play |pg||
nt|andyv:  and NS should get some imps back as they managed to stay low on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, Jeff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  not sure if 2@d was a xfer to @hs but appears that way|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hoffers: Lazer has shown invitational values (2C was puppet to 2D)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no but a good amount as the current datum is -440 so currently 9|pg||
nt|olson: the dummy lacks an entry  to the diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: again we must applaud this terrific scoring system|pg||
pc|d3|nt|olson: it could be somekind  of  drury |pg||
nt|benjent: Good technical duck by Lazer - if you have to lose a trick, it's usually better to lose it early. And cutting the opponents' communication is also often a good idea|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Don't he have time for bought of those hooks?|pg||

nt|benjent: Not much in the way of comparisons available yet, but so far Griffiths-Neill have racked up 4 positives to 1 negative, and look to me to be slightly ahead against Peake-Wu|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: With everything favourable, this should make (only the SA lead could threaten the contract)|pg||

nt|olson: if 1d  limited  south hand  to less than 17 ,  should play spade Q  in North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did E count here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  nicely done|pg||
nt|hoffers: A pyrric victory for NS|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and thx to Henry and John |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs with the comments  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello evryone|pg||
nt|hoffers: But Gumby's card at trick 1 would have now shown her with 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Both pairs at this table running out of boards. 2nd and 3rd only have 2 or 3 boards left to play, and nothing bad has happened to them|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|bucheister: sorry I had to leave for a few boards|pg||
nt|frankaus: a tight match here all but ensurer the 3 leaders will be the team members|pg||
nt|hoffers: A good pragmatic bid by Pauline|pg||
nt|benjent: If one of these pairs is going to sneak into the NSW team, they're going to have to get motoring in a hurry, and under their own power|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: likely short break    to "catch up" the schedule |pg||
nt|henryb:  bye Shirley|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2010&dir=anc/s3&E=0&R=6&T=R  for standings after round 6|pg||
nt|hoffers: Slam require 2 of 3 finesses (plus spade break), so less than 50%|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the double finesses working slam makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|olson: ok,  once south showed with  club ace  dia  ak  and H  king    spade Q  and dia jack missing    |pg||
nt|hoffers: A heart to Ace is correct play|pg||
nt|benjent: Lazer-Gumby respond 1@D/@h/@s with potentially no points at all to 1@c|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: not one you'd want to bid unless desperate|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|d9|nt|olson: since south is known as balanced  hand ,   south would open 1n   with 15 - 17  so he cannot have  spade Q    unless something odd  like  2452  and desire not to open nt|pg||
