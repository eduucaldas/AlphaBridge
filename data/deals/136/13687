nt|avivs:  looks like south is relaying|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: north is telling south that he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|avivs:  2D probably showed minimum (or subminimum...) opening|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is probably a completely artificial auction with south asking. none of his bids are natural (Im guessing)|pg||
nt|avivs:  2@s maybe unbalanced and 3@d shortness there?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|itinerant: one would suspect a few imps will be coming back Klinger's way when board 15 is scored with the open room|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I think this N-S pair plays 2-way checkback where 2@C is a puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|itinerant: Mullamphy and Klinger use "two way checkback"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|itinerant: voila|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|itinerant: so, in this instance, Mullamphy has shown and invitaional hand wih 5 spades|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: 2@H for instance would have shown 5-4, NF|pg||
nt|itinerant: the only possible way for this contract to go down, i think would be if Klinger plays on clubs for trick number 9 and Edgtton has the chutzpah to play the T|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D is the artificial game-force|pg||
pc|d2|nt|itinerant: klinger may then hope he has begun with JTxx and therefore may duck hte club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|itinerant: oh|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Sandra Landy of England had a Bols Tip in the 80's. Whenever the auction suggests a trump lead, you should lead one regardless of your holding, even from Kx. The trick will come ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back with interest |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|itinerant: mullamphy recognised the trump control issue and witheld from ruffing a second heart - the only play to make after the diamond duck was, in fact, hearts 33|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|itinerant: given 3C was forcing, Mull' could be certain he would get a chance to double at a higher level.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|itinerant: .... come to think of it... xx KQxxx x QJTxx might take a stab at 3C and also pass over 2D|pg||

nt|avivs:  South has a lot of catching up to do|pg||
nt|hoffers: I think Whibley has a stop!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|hoffers: Difficult now to get to 7|pg||
nt|avivs:  which text book say preempting with J fifth and out are wrong? throw it out!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: Maybe 6H as a try|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|mc|13|nt|avivs:  I think Whibley should have realized he has too much|pg||

mb|2D!|an|0-7|nt|itinerant: agricultural auction in the open room here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes the hypnotic attraction of Jxx in 3rd seat white i ssimply irresistible|pg||
nt|itinerant: oddly it was east who pre-empted on this board in the other room|pg||
nt|bucheister: With all due respect to all; if you play 5 card majors then you must open 1C; just has to do with the system|pg||
mb|2H!|an|takeout of !Hs|nt|marlowepi: things change in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: what is this "system" thing everybody speaks of?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no idea|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2@ds weak multi I presume . less than 8 points|pg||
nt|itinerant: yuck|pg||
nt|poohbear: Mullamphy shouldnt pass|pg||
nt|itinerant: klinger has an ace more than he might for this action|pg||
nt|poohbear: but odds of getting to the cold grand are highly diminished|pg||
nt|poohbear: agree|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed mullamphy shouldn't pass - but how to agree trumps and blackwood from here.... ?|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you have a subminimal hand then certainly open a good four card major; if you have a constructive hand you open a five card major.  The system is the 2/1 played by most of the ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: good players in the USA.|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps he should have passed the TO of 2@h for penalties :P|pg||
nt|itinerant: that was surely the right thing, barry|pg||
nt|poohbear: matt should bid 4@c here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Problem playing against multi is that there is no convenient Q bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: I think blackwood from the south hand is not outrageous now|pg||
nt|itinerant: the chances of being off SAK are not high|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h might be the right view . Besides 4NT sounds Natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger counts only 12 cards in his hand, finds one under the bidding tray|pg||
nt|itinerant: yep, good point |pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes 4N would not be BW unless that agreem,ent is in place|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: believe it or not folks, 750 for 5HX was a push!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: But who knows? 4@h could sound natural too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|itinerant: loll|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|itinerant: he has 200 points for honours|pg||
mc|13|nt|poohbear: In the other room West dbled the 4NT overcall so he could have easily passed 5@h  to partner on board 24|pg||
nt|bucheister: Very tenative by NS; N started with a cue bid and S had 16 hcp and a good suit; |pg||
nt|itinerant: what time are we back for the next set, nick?|pg||
nt|nickf: checking|pg||
nt|nickf: in 25 mins, 15min earlier than advertised|pg||
nt|bucheister: thank you operator for a great job and to my four card major friends|pg||
nt|itinerant: thanks all|pg||
nt|itinerant: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: keeping this table until the opne table finishes|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: score corrected in open room, closing this table now|pg||
