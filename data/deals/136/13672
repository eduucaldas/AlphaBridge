mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: east should regard her hand as junk|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might get a spade lead|pg||
nt|affe82: at some tables south has erred when in on club ace on a spade lead not returning heart giving decl time to set up winners|pg||
pc|h6|nt|affe82: almost all tables in 3n. it's truly a juniors' event. especially when racing in last round|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but they must learn thae the tortoise often wins as against the hare|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  current standings|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: so a X'd hand to start us off, maybe will be an exciting set of hands :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: North does have supermax for his 1D opening, perhaps just took a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Staffan |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a "killer" lead for E |pg||

pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: when N bid 3S he said: "i am worth an invite in spades", the rest is up to you. W bid strongly and EW are not vul, so they dont rate to go down more than one. S was not vul either ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so with spades might have taken some liberties. if N thought his hand was this good, maybe he should have double 2S|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: all of these players  are pretty aggressive in bidding, successful too|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think N bid reasonably.  Took a chance and saw that it had paid off, so extracted the max.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: The key to success on that hand was the ruff of the @dq with the @s2 at trick 2!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: all i am saying is that the overall auction by N was inconsistent. i did not say any single bid was wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and N sits, |pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead may be messy here |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: question in my mind is do you only bid 3 @c with N |pg||
nt|andyv:  both sides can make 3 level contracts|pg||

nt|marlowepi: there is no contract more perfect than a game making through luck opr misdefense|pg||

nt|yuval10: i think it's easily makeable|pg||

nt|andyv:  polish 2 bid...@ss and another (not @hs)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was either 16+ any or 11-13 with 6+@H. 2@D showed accept if p had 16+, 2@S showed exactly 3@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: and back a spade |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|peachy: also helps that help was not needed to make, this time...|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: This one needs the misdef factor, but they arent getting it, spade lead prob coming|pg||
pc|d7|nt|djneill: no system card, but it appears East opened a swedish/polish/strong @c, and now West has enough to act (not sure why didn't act over 1@s)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make S play the trump suit  from the top |pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: nowadays many players tend to lead a major after the 1NT-3NT sequence, sometimes even with 5 cards minor suit in their hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: it has the luck factor, the @CA in the right place|pg||
nt|peachy: actually, there is a line to make and surely Oddur will find it (duck)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|djneill: South can see the @d on the board and will find the @c switch after winning a @h|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|friggi: W and E are brothers and they know each other very well|pg||
nt|friggi: so it could make!?|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR on Bd 1, 4@H was played undoubled by E.  Down one, so 6 to HFV.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must be missing something. isnt it trivial to make 3N here?|pg||
nt|friggi: it is|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, club ace right. Even diamonds all in the S|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence got a chance here, but not so easy to see. |pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr:      |pg||
nt|djneill: 4@d, 4@c, 2 Aces at least, all South has to do is hold up a few spades to cut communication between the E-W hands, so might just make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|djneill: but a 2@s opening might have put South to a problem had North doubled - but if they had Lebensohl, South would be able to show some HCP and North would cue-bid 3@s and South would ...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|chick: yes, no more entry to spade tricks or to diamond finesse|pg||

nt|djneill: brd 21, the strong NT preempted the opponents, and since weak NT is the range for this N-S, that was a random swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW did well to go with a plus score here, for sure|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|yuval10: most of the pairs play 1NT here as 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|mr murray: very satisfying plus|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@h probably 10-13|pg||

mb|2D|nt|andyv:  sure killed this auction quickly|pg||
nt|yuval10: in a good day a game is makeable |pg||
nt|yuval10: not today though|pg||
nt|andyv:  switch the EW hands and game makes|pg||
nt|mr murray: looks like a quiet 110|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 13 to HFV on 9 - GT failed by 1 in 4@C there and went for 800 here.|pg||
nt|mr murray: never quiet|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, helps to by psychic sometimes|pg||
nt|mr murray: up to 140 now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks routine also |pg||
nt|sybarra: a club lead would be a problem  but not easy from axx for W |pg||
nt|andyv:  and counting:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree! pass, 2@h or 2@s - not forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: 1NT would've gone down 1, but EW can actually make plenty of tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that they're likely to go too high anyway|pg||
nt|fifee: 1NTX was probably off 1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: 9 going in,  may find the 10th  |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: short of entries to hand, may play club honor'|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cute spade spots|pg||
nt|djneill: likely this is just a strong @c, since most Polish/Swedish would not be able to respond 2@c opposite a possible 11 HCP otherwise|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: necessary if N had AQT of Ds|pg||
nt|djneill: so, 2@c game force 5+@c, 2@h 5+@h, 3@h fit, East cue-bids to be courteous, as does West, and both realize they are both minimum after 4@h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  actually was up to 170|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and this is a winning position also|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|djneill: East's 4@c bypassed 3@s, so East does not have a @s control - so when West cue-bids 4@d, that implies no worry about 2 fast @s losers|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: if he played @s, yes...but he must've been affraid of a ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  and still is|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|sybarra: think I might have cashed the kq of @H's |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|mr murray: time to go to sleep.  Early session tomorrow morning|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: if spade hook wins|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad communications:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|djneill: South did quite well not to lead @d, but perhaps the fact that North did not double the 4 @d cue-bid was a negative inference (if North had good @d might ahve doubled 4@d)|pg||

nt|andyv:  with good reason|pg||
nt|andyv:  no|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm on lead.. i know what to lead... equal vul gives 1 or 2@s little value... maybe in matchpoints it's ok|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|yuval10: E did well to bid 3@h|pg||

nt|yuval10: aggressive 1@s opening next door, unless they do it systematically|pg||
mb|4H|nt|djneill: South's 3@h is forcing (North denied 4@h probably by not negative doubling)|pg||
