mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|hedyg: they play prec @C with most natural advances and some relays, 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so 2@d was natural, gf|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Gunev really likes his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may end in 6@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the CR Madala showed gamegoing 5-5 minors over 1NT and then closed in 5 @c over 4@c|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or 6@C even....|pg||
nt|hedyg: put your mouse over the score in the top left corner to see the bidding there|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: this hand  does show the dangers of heading into the slam zone with a weak side-suit (here, diamonds). North probbaly thought the @DAQ were gold dust|pg||
nt|hedyg: there seems to be a @d/@s squeeze|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

pc|c8|nt|hedyg: Duboin feeling the squeeze coming|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, we can see that West can be squeezed. Maybe North would not have bid 6@C without the @s10  |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, welcome back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ciao a tutti, bienvenuti|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
nt|daman: All of these players have names that would look good on a bottle of Italian wine|pg||
nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|daman: the systems are skewed at times so we will have to guess on occasion|pg||
nt|daman: so    if NS play a weak NT   that's what they will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: tah dH|pg||
nt|daman: dah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza way ahead of the field at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
nt|daman: obviously not a transfer|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
nt|daman: South will continue to compete over 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably will finish here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam woyuld be too much of an adventire|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a little danger now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: West luckily has an out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Lorenzo LAURIA http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4849 top 5 ranking in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Geoff and Roland 4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||
nt|daman: @D 10   suit preference for @Ss|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: hello welcome|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: NS we always going to make 3@D     so they need to beat this 2 to get a push|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jtr: I heard about 3m showing both minors recently but this is the first time i have seen it used|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|daman: North does not have a lot of options|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h9|pc|cQ|nt|jtr: North had a very suitable hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: safety play for stiff king @D was laying down the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: If South's @sK was in @ds then slam is lay down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked by several specs how old Benito Garozzo is. He was born in 1927, so he is either 82 or 83|pg||

nt|hedyg: thats all, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c=2+|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not bidding that lousy @d suit again!|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: he had the @D6 instead of the @D4|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1NT in this kind of position is usually played as 10-12-ish, to allow for a lightish fourth-in-hand bid. North has a decent enough hand, so invites |pg||

nt|h_karluk: Luigi REIFF http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20864|pg||
nt|athene: very boring 4@H+1 here|pg||

nt|daman: can*|pg||
nt|jtr: Has he moved back to Italy?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 82 I am told|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: he endplayed West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that I know of|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he is regarded as a native Italian as far as bridge in Italy is concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: ok ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: see 1@s with 8HCP|pg||
nt|daman: if my Mom had the North hand   we would be in 6@Ds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Il buon giorno si vede dal mattino (the good day can be seen from the morning)  1 supposedly good for NS pair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N normal contract, not much words needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, less boring now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: North is going to drive them to some slam|pg||
nt|daman: guaranteed|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 2NT with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|jtr: Polish type @c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: welcome aboard buddy|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S   is not on my radar|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|jtr: Why 1@d then?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D was some bid on this collection|pg||
pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play 2/1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D a semi-psyche if you like. He is NV vs V|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: age hasnt dulled his bridge awareness|pg||
nt|jtr: This is rather horrid for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: He will think the @dK is offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: might try to use the hearts via a double finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||
nt|daman: he will take hois 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: of course north felt there was too much danger his side was getting stolen from|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|daman: that's the sound on BBO when you claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a push for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Win @cA and a low @d looks sensible|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: both slams make but diamonds safer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|daman: I guess he could bid 5@H asking for a @C control|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike  and thanks for joining|pg||
nt|daman: or Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike, good to see you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening from rainy London|pg||
nt|daman: what should he do if he bids 4NT and partner shows 2 with the Queen?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: ah   my other option   asks for a @C control|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|daman: now   South should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not what North had in mind |pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: something went wron|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: the dreaded fake reverse by North got them in hot water|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: not once did North show @H support|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|daman: and the got away with it     a @S lead would have been embarrassing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you wonder if 1@H-2@D-2@h-3@D is forcing |pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: I guess N was a good hand for Fit Jump if such on card|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer surprised by that @dJ:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To my mind, Benito Garozzo is the greatest player the world has ever seen. It's unlikely that that the future will produce another player as perfect as he was, and to a large ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: extent still is. In many respects. What a treat it is to watch the legend in action|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standings after 4 rounds: 1. Lavazza 89 - 2. Angelini 81 - 3. Fornaciari 70   among 10 teams|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|daman: why not 1@H   2@D   2@H   3@H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: I like that too Geroge|pg||
nt|daman: another option|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: the object of the game of bridge is to find your fit|pg||
nt|daman: quickly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Somewhat difficult for East to find a spade lead....|pg||
nt|daman: yes :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so.... |pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: he was one of my heroes when i started to play|pg||

mb|d|nt|hedyg: drury 2@c?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: yes drury in the CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like it. 4@c almost certainly a splinter|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: specs asking if 9hcps 4 3 3 3 enough for invite|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@C probably 9-11 by a passed hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: Primavera bid 3@c over the double by N so they stayed 1 level lower for the cuebidding and managed to stop in time|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Are we safe at this level giving pd 7 or so?" - no.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, ypu suspect Fantoni-Nunes will find 6@D or 6@H at the other table |pg||
nt|jtr: And may still be when you finish:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but JTxx sets|pg||
nt|daman: well    they have other issues as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, got out cheaply for 5.|pg||

nt|daman: undo|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: or does that really show the majors lol|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: Nelle botti piccine ci sta il vino buono, well good things come in small packages|pg||
nt|athene: now we find out if NS know their methods :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Drury|pg||
nt|jtr: North i mean|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 just on the @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|chick: X is very likely a support double, showing 3 card spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: well, either the double was penalties, in which case north should pass, or it wasn't, in which case lauria shouldn't double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C shows shortage i assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|peachy: North has a normal diamond lead, IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chick: Hi Mike and Hamdi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Cornelia, welcome|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont know what 3NT means other than it isnt natural:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has supported hearts already and is effectively cuebidding|pg||
nt|jtr: It seems 300 specs have an idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt be suprised by a 6@H punt now |pg||
nt|jtr: @s value makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Daniela|pg||
nt|daman: a very intelligent auction|pg||
nt|daman: a@D lead would have been something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norberto Bocchi interview at http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/2010%e2%80%99s-europeans-norberto-bocchi-talks-about.html|pg||
nt|daman: longest suit|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for your suggestions sorry i cannt type out thanks 300 times|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: then they defeat the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - science is being used|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
nt|daman: now  it will make10 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: if you assume diamonds are 5-2, vacant places suggests the heart finesse the other way?|pg||
nt|daman: fortune favors the bold|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: !4 ? :)|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: the double locates the @SA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: now N will be lucky because the long diamonds with the long trumps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: maybe, however QT9x also possible <my review, my opinion> just a1 HCP difference|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ace and a jack and a ten and a long suit - more likely to sit.|pg||

nt|sybarra: looking at bidding not sure what 2 @D was |pg||

pc|h9|nt|athene: especially when opps are in the middle of an artificial sequence (i assume 1@D was some sort of relay)|pg||

nt|sybarra: bridge pro might last longer |pg||
nt|sybarra: less injuries |pg||
nt|athene: but as a practical measure, when you have that east hand and partner opens, and opps are bidding hearts, you are asking an awful lot of partner if you get cute with control bids|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Olson|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bid slam, or blackwood, or something that makes west's life a bit easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we talking about a hand only 4 losers after west opened?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Forcing pd to bypass 5@S to either control bid at 6 level or blast slam -- I'm with you, it was time to get realistic..|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what's the problem finding slam ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes and the small doubletons weren't even in opps' suit, which might give you some pause|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D  majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Should be able to avoid the @s guess here one way or another|pg||
nt|roswolf: the double by west was radical in my young days|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: or so it seems|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: welcome to Joe Shair |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think even east would ask 4N over 2@h could stop in 5 <worst scenario>|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@C|pg||
nt|olson: yes  clubs break  3/3  so he has  2 discards|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bal 15 count - heresy in the 1960's|pg||
nt|jtr: But will probably get a @d lead anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
nt|olson: or they fail to lead clubs and  hand makes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|daman: Italians cuebid  A  k  or singleton normally|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if weak nt, pretty frisky slam try by south|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heart values were obv w opps, so even 11 easy to visualize|pg||
nt|daman: I suppose he might find the perfect hand 1 out of 1000 times|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: off 4 tricks on power|pg||
nt|daman: 5 tricks on ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whew, you had me worried there for a moment...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: this will bring them to a grinding halt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Fortunately for them. 5 should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Unusual to double with 3-3 in the majors, but I think it's better than 1NT for two reasons. Partner is a passed hand, and Axx not the greatest holding for NT. Even if you disagree, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's hard to argue with the maestro's decisions; he has played a little before|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: Nice little @S Q-J.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt was probably better by east to offer the choice of games|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he found a @c lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 5 is in jeopardy, but the 3c bid should help with the h guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: as I predicted    a @D lead on Board 3 would have beat 3NT    Fantoni led it in the OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually no real guess, since takes h out|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: they lead a @S here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: quite an effective lead though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: well always winner QTx/Ax , K with declarer|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: 2NT by North was quite aggressive|pg||
nt|daman: yes Jim  5 is perfectly safe|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer can have a sigh of relief, makes now regardless of how hearts are|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @cQ onside, declarer should make at least 3@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: @h finesse fails, prospects bleak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still down|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem odd, but what other explanation is there for 4@S?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: maybe he was thinking that south would just double then bid 3@D second round with a diamond hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: on power|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: looks like 3@C initiated a sign-off sequence|pg||
nt|athene: so double then double then diamonds isn't that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: maybe, what i am sure 1@s didn't promise a rose garden, and 11 with a stiff in vul vs nonvul 2N "weird"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently 3@C asked for shortage, 3@H showed x@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: But I still don't see a jump to 4@S.|pg||

nt|daman: 1NT by South      maybe they open 15 - 17 in first red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: both pairs were playing weak NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: 2@s shows heart support with a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h seems fine for NS|pg||
nt|chick: EW have a reasonable sacrifice in diamonds, but apparently they aren't going to find it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, if they don't bid game, you don't have to sacrifice|pg||

pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: @d obv artificial forcing, 3@h stop, hard to reach game, normal result|pg||

pc|cT|nt|roswolf: simple sequence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: they built up a system aptly named "nightmare"|pg||

nt|daman: they have no tricks on the side other than trumps|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in that case you score 3 trumps and hope a trick on an side suit|pg||

nt|athene: either that or they put the board on the table rotated through 180 degrees|pg||
nt|athene: that's most likely actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N off to a small @s lead or @sQ|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Law says to bid 3@s (nine trumps) but maybe with his soft values he was afraid EW might bid a missed game|pg||
nt|athene: it's all about how many entries you have to the north hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: 3@S was not my choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and a funny superaccept, as i thought they will nicely land to 4@s, however @d lead will hurt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @c by south?|pg||

nt|roswolf: south might raise|pg||
mb|2N|nt|daman: what are they trying to accomplish/|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: specs suggest 2 nt |pg||

nt|roswolf: 2/3 nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i suspect they are trying to make surprises for us|pg||
nt|daman: 2 after this|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are all wrong |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: with one of my pards 2NT there would be 6@C4@d  |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: and we still have 3 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: can't really hurt to bid 3D on the way, assuming 3D is forcing for them|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good time to play 2s over 2h as a one round force|pg||
nt|peachy: This is no way to catch up, from behind|pg||

nt|santyclz: My partners are grateful when my hands are remotely similar to what my bids show.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: dd solution|pg||
nt|athene: this must have good chances|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: in practice one may pull AK|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: done|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: this contract is not in jeopardy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now asking if they can play 3 nt |pg||
nt|olson: not  often I get a great  20 count with  nice pattern |pg||
nt|jtr: Some would use 2NT by East|pg||
nt|jtr: As 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as 4@d denied club stopper 4@s normal contract|pg||
nt|athene: hard to reach hand for the club up|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff is ok i guess|pg||
nt|athene: the mistake is to throw the club on this - you need that club loser to set up your tenth winner (@CQ)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: AKA Scramble|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: the other line is to throw the club and ruff two hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer doesnt have a whole lot to think about here|pg||
nt|olson: 2n by east is best to show  playable in 2 suits  or  lebensohl  showing  extreme  weakness|pg||
nt|roswolf: strange choice by east surely either 2nt - a sort of scramble was better here|pg||
nt|ritong: the maestro might express some disapproval about 3@c|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems a concensus exists|pg||
nt|olson: w could be  1354 and this  works ,  but  game in H  only needs 10 tricks ,  and E was hoping  to  find a spot  undoubled|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c is no certainty|pg||
nt|olson: yes,  2n should not  be natural     scramble  is  common  treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice @sK by Madala|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|daman: mind you|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|pc|cQ|pc|s8|pg||

pc|d8|pc|cA|pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|wygbe1: notice declarer's failure to lead the 9 on first round of spades left him poorly placed to finesse against south's spade jack - since suit blocked|pg||
