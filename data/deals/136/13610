nt|josj: selamat siang Indonesia and hello to all|pg||
nt|josj: Here we go for the Final of the InterProvince Champ's|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|josj: selamat malam Batam & sekitarnya :)|pg||
nt|josj: good day (or whatever) to all others|pg||
nt|josj: this time it's East Java playing East Borneo (Kal.)|pg||
nt|josj: selamat siang Indonesia and hello to all of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Re hi all nice spec and co commentators:)|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam and rehi all for the closing segment of the final|pg||
nt|josj: 10 more boards to go to decide a winner|pg||
nt|josj: though there i something strange in the Kalimantan team: at this table, a strong pair from Manado (North Celebes) is playing for them... |pg||
nt|josj: after well over 200 boards, the pre-tournament favourites made it to the finals alright|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: selamat siang untuk Indonesia and hello to all other spectators|pg||
nt|josj: is|pg||
nt|josj: welcome to the quarterfinals of the Inter Province Champ's.|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam Indonesia and (re)hi to all of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not 4@D from W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice cards for NS but a bad layout in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: rehi Rødal|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: hi every one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: sry: I mean East Java, of course, I was talking about Rogi-Wohon|pg||
nt|josj: they are Manadonese|pg||
nt|josj: the format is 2 segments of 16 boards|pg||
nt|josj: Here is one of the semifinals of the Inter province Champ's|pg||
nt|josj: 2x16 boards so the match will be completed tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|josj: we have only the first half tonight|pg||
nt|josj: the host province the Riau Archipelago, are playing the big favourites for the title, the Jakarta Metropolitan Area team |pg||
nt|otoj: hi Jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Joto|pg||
nt|josj: good to have a fellow commentator available|pg||
nt|westjava: good morning,afternoon,evening|pg||
nt|josj: they will face their nearest neighbours, West Java Province|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Often u like to play 4 in major here afterthe opening and the 3@D.|pg||
nt|josj: the 4 winners proceed to the semis (seems logical)|pg||
nt|westjava: Broadcasting from Golden View Hotel 10th floor, Batam, Riau Islands, Indonesia|pg||
pc|h6|nt|josj: 4@S is not down yet...trumplead is best :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@Dminisplinter and @S it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: here we have another match of the Inter-Provinces qualifications|pg||
nt|josj: selamat sore untuk Indonesia and hello again to all other spectators|pg||
nt|otoj: the other semi is Jawa Barat (West Java) against Sulawesi Utara (North Celebes)|pg||
nt|josj: why is it that this does not surprise me? :)|pg||
nt|josj: who's playing for Sulut?|pg||
nt|josj: in the meantime, Riau A. are heading for touble right on the 1st board|pg||
nt|westjava: This is Indonesia 48th Championships 2010, Inter Province, semi final|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ferlema: aparentemente dos multas|pg||
nt|josj: I hope South bid 1@S over 1@C and not East|pg||
nt|josj: Venue is Batam, Riau Archipelago, just off the coast of Singapore|pg||
nt|josj: r|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked west by the try. Non vul|pg||
nt|josj: it's good for your geographical knowledge of the country :)|pg||
nt|josj: but anyway, NS started off by missing a reasonably cold slam|pg||
nt|otoj: Henky-Eddy .. not so sure the others.. since two pairs (Tommy-Octa & Mondingir-Tumbel) are now playing for East Java|pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: so NS escaped the axe here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ferlema: una baza de triunfo @D A y K y @C A y K|pg||
nt|josj: 6NT needs @D 5-0 to go down|pg||
nt|josj: a big swing on the last board played in the OR gave Jakarta a quite healthy lead of 33 with just the 16 boards of this segment to play|pg||
nt|josj: rehi all and selamat sore Indonesia :)|pg||
nt|josj: yes I spotted some strangers in the Jatim team :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: 6@S is worse but still well over 50% so a good second choice|pg||
nt|josj: The DKI Jakarta (Metropolitan Area) is mostly surrounded by West Java Province with its beautiful capital Bandung, called the "Paris of Java"|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|josj: selamat sore and good morning/evening etc. to all of you|pg||
nt|josj: this lead will certainly do declarer no harm|pg||
nt|westjava: Sulawesi Utara (North Sulawesi) vs Jawa Barat (West Java)|pg||
nt|josj: the format is 2x16 boards so it will all be over in just over four hours from now|pg||
nt|josj: only a short interval after 16 boards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Took the full speed?|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the team from South Celebes (Makassar) is facing South Sumatra (Palembang)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|westjava: other semi final is DKI Jakarta vs KEPRI|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: extra tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|josj: Tobing-Asbi, the EW pair, have often played for the national team|pg||
nt|josj: about any line declarer chooses, will work|pg||
nt|josj: @C finesse works, @C are 3-3|pg||
nt|josj: with Ong at the helm, it may take some time before he has calculated the best line|pg||
pc|s2|nt|baldjean: it looks as if the match stfarts excitingly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: hi all :) welcome|pg||
nt|josj: it's going to be quite an uphill task for the Semarang team to catch up the Metropolitans|pg||
nt|otoj: a test defense after leading @cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: DKI leads the way 70-24 imps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|josj: the only way to make 6@D is to ruff the @CA but alas, BBO won't allow it...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|josj: this way, Ong is relying on the @C finesse if a trump comes back|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|westjava: on this table 46-24 on the 1st 16 boards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldjean: will be a quick claim|pg||
nt|josj: well, we have to be stuck as there is little to think about in playing this contract :)|pg||
nt|josj: the bad news for EW is that the @SA is right; if not, 5@D might have been in trouble as well|pg||
nt|otoj: even though not shifting to @S is not fatal in this board.. maybe in other board will be.. so asking a swich to @s will be a good choice..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: The safe line against 05 is?|pg||
nt|josj: @CAK now and then declarer knows trumps atr 5-0|pg||
nt|josj: are|pg||
nt|josj: not touching trumps at all|pg||
nt|josj: but he probably did not expect that Franky had led a trump from Qxx|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: the NS pair is from Semarang, Central Java's capital and also a center of bridge in the country|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: I think this is a Round 7 match between the West Java and North Sumatra teams so it's Bandung v. Medan|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzhu: revioke|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|josj: Here is the final of the Indonesian National Clubs Championships|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: of course, we should not talk about trivialities like ending in 3nt...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|josj: these 2 provincial capitals are among the largest cities of the country, just behind Jakarta and Surabaya|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|josj: 40 boards in all, 2x10 now and 2x10 at 19.00 WIB|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am I stuched?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. I was a bit unfaire against W. Odd sor income is better then odd por pay at the bid now.|pg||
nt|josj: Jakarta is "hors concours," of course, with well over 15 million people around|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|josj: and a good start for Gabrial UI, the Bridge Club of the Universitas Indonesia at Depok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|sJ|mc|10|nt|westjava: Hi every one!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|westjava: @S lead other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|marcsmith: should manage 9 easily enough even with the diamonds lying poorly|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that's a good lead for the defence tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: easy on a major-suit lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now declarer needs a lot and may panic when he cashes DA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marcsmith: has to play a spade towards queen early otherwise he'll have entry problems|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|westjava: @S small now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: D to K now perhaps|pg||
nt|marcsmith: or small spade|pg||
nt|marcsmith: DA is not best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marcsmith: whilstheart lead doesn't give anything away, it tells decaler what he needs to know |pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now surely a low spade|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard to see how he can make if if the SK is not onside and clubs 4-4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: onlu chance he has left now|pg||
nt|westjava: Syabas Energy with NS here and EW CR was a champion of Premier League 3 weeks ago|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well,declarer in the closed room got a favourable lead and then butchered both red suits to go down -- can this East take his only chance to make the contract?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has to play a low spade now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if he touches hearts first, the defence can block the spades|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|marcsmith: that seems to be just giving up|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Jos, Roland and specs|pg||
nt|rodal f: for      for    * GRR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u feel that WE was a bit lucky here Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: playing Geologi Timah, fro Bandung's Geological Institute|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well I asked for the best line.|pg||
nt|josj: lead a @C raher than a @H from dummy to find out the exact layout|pg||
nt|josj: so a very lucky escape there with 4@S easily made|pg||
nt|westjava: This is Indonesia 48th Championships 2010, Inter Province Round-10|pg||
nt|westjava: 24 Provinces devided in Pool A and Pool B|pg||
nt|josj: after the @D lead you have to finesse in spades before you discard your losing @D on the hearts, using the @H entries to repeat the @S finesse|pg||
nt|josj: non vul. it's not obvious to reach game|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to see where that 7th trick had to come from|pg||
nt|josj: so the obvious underdogs in this match get exacly the start they must have been hoping to avoid...|pg||
nt|josj: touch and go but a very effective start for Jabar|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|josj: not really|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was. Dont play thrumh. Asu said Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: with @CQJ10 and the three-card @S in E, there should have been an automatic squeeze for 13 tricks but declarer did not bother (nor did I).|pg||
nt|josj: and here we have another beautiful misfit|pg||
nt|josj: pinpointed by East's Multi :)|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope 2@S shows @H and a minor|pg||
nt|otoj: Sumarouw, Hidayatullah, and Liogu are young players.. below 30..|pg||
nt|josj: that's a fine sign|pg||

mb|1H|nt|baldjean: let's see if E/W play garbage stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  should stop at 4@s|pg||
nt|josj: Laksamana is a team from Pekanbaru, not too far away from Batam|pg||

nt|josj: EW play 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|otoj: Hidayatullah has some international experience when representing Indonesian Junior Team for couple years|pg||
nt|westjava: both NS/EW play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhh: ...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@S would not have been my cup of tea but it effectievly takes away 3HT as a landing spot for W|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: with both rounded finesses working, 5@D makes even if played by East so the save would have been correct had it not gone down too much (-5, maybe...)|pg||
nt|josj: but we will see...|pg||
nt|josj: in spite of the trump lead, this should make easily|pg||
mb|3N|nt|josj: Gabrial is one of the teams representing UI: Universitas Indonesia|pg||
nt|josj: this is in Depok, 40 km S of Jakarta |pg||
nt|rodal f: No comment here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2 and 3 @D my fealing was 4@D from W but he did right by the X.|pg||
nt|rodal f: feeling*|pg||
nt|josj: and S did well not to balance...|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: apparently they do|pg||
nt|josj: Tommy Rogi did the right thing, anyway...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: MGTH means"may good things happen"|pg||
nt|josj: and it's one of the cheapest spots to go for NS as well...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but it always remains to be seen for which side :)|pg||
nt|josj: and a more quiet deal here but 7 tricks are far away for EW, I think|pg||
nt|josj: and so does Octa...|pg||
nt|josj: so we might need a calculator here|pg||
nt|josj: EW apparently playing 12-14 NT openings|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ferlema: este torneo sirve de preparacion para el proximo campeonato sudamericano,,, toda la info click aqui: http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010.htm|pg||
nt|josj: is a grand a good proposition here?|pg||
nt|josj: again trump lead is best|pg||
nt|josj: NS can make a slam (Roland's choice) but 4Red X will go down a lot|pg||
nt|westjava: NS may land in 3nt,4@S or 5@C|pg||
nt|otoj: diamond lead will give declarer 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: morning Joto!|pg||
nt|otoj: selamat pagi|pg||
nt|otoj: Lasut is thinking about 5@c or 6@c|pg||
nt|josj: this lead makes it easy going|pg||
nt|josj: a club lead would have been testing|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|baldjean: the way cards lie even 4 woujld make though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|josj: and this time,the leader has a few of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot I like. Could have been better at an other contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but the contract not really in danger anyway|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C, 3@H and exit in @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: 3@C que by @D|pg||
nt|josj: hi Adi :)|pg||
nt|josj: even more so if S shifts to  club|pg||
nt|otoj: which is makeable due to good behaviour of @cq|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|otoj: an input from a kib..Sumarouw representing Indonesian U28 Team for WMSG 2008 in Beijing|pg||
nt|westjava: as you said, 12 tricks in his pocket|pg||

nt|josj: now Denny has to locate the @HQ and hope for the best in @C|pg||
nt|josj: neither should present any real problem...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: NO?|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 top rank each pool go to Quarterfinal|pg||
nt|josj: overtricks non vul. are much cheaper than doubled undertricks vul.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|josj: this saves an undertrick|pg||
nt|josj: well...|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|soban: from other semi final GEOLOGI TIMAH leading 30 imps againt BHINEKA (Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Jemmy Bojoh, Leslie Gontha)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|josj: this is teams so np |pg||
nt|rodal f: If u don't cover a honor u don't have (the@SQ)|pg||
nt|josj: now he can always ruff a club and throw one on @DK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||
nt|westjava: the famous pair from Sulawesi Utara (North Sulawesi), Henky Lasut-Eddy Manoppo|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: there go the @H tricks for the def.|pg||
nt|josj: -4 I can calculate by heart :)|pg||
nt|josj: an effective line, I have to admit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ferlema: con la linea que esta jugando Esteban hay 10 bazas|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick now|pg||
nt|josj: North is discarding a lot of undertricks...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks even|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: ? How could Tobing find that??|pg||
nt|josj: throw the last club and play trumps...|pg||
nt|josj: but N will fell some pressure|pg||
nt|josj: feel|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|josj: we saw something like that in the Premier League as well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: both World International Master|pg||
nt|josj: the @C10 will save declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: not very interesting at imps though ...in short matches, every imp might count|pg||
pc|s9|nt|josj: so declarer's club play confused everyone|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: A auto small?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ment the Q@S, but some other chances was there so ok.|pg||
nt|josj: trying to play safe|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|soban: right Josj.|pg||
nt|josj: if either red suit breaks 3-2, there are 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good contract|pg||

nt|josj: Maybe, South's double was a little aggressive, vul.|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A very normal contract by 21HPEW it was.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|josj: intriguing problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|westjava: some disturbance from NS against 1@C strong|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW can escape for a tolerable penalty against 3N|pg||
nt|otoj: a pass from Parpar will guarantee score..|pg||
nt|otoj: since 4@h will probably go down..|pg||

pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||

nt|rodal f: Do u know if EW alsouse pres Jos? |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: this is a Round 8 match in the qualifications. They are about halfway through it now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's 2nd dbl probably influenced by the vul|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|josj: so much ado about nothing..50 apiece|pg||
nt|westjava: other semi final is DKI Jakarta vs KEPRI, 70-24 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
nt|josj: on a  @S lead this might be problematic|pg||
nt|josj: I doubt it, they play 12-14 NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit nice by % now.|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
nt|westjava: dbl by Manoppo?|pg||
nt|josj: EW had better keep a litle quiet here as the breaks are quite unfriendely for them |pg||
nt|josj: the advantage of the Multi by N is that NS avoid their @C fit|pg||
nt|josj: I think EW will reach a simple 3nt here|pg||
nt|josj: Strong Club|pg||
mb|d!|nt|josj: it's hard work, they started at 9 am or so to complete 7 rounds...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||

nt|otoj: 1NT contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took the 16+ EW too as NS use|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: dbl after preempt pd, of course penalty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
nt|josj: in the meantime, declarer went down in his good 4@H when he lost control of the trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
nt|josj: 2NT confirming a sound opening bid in 3rd pos.|pg||
nt|josj: DD it needs a @C lead to beat 4@S as the defence cannot duck the @HK once|pg||
nt|josj: and Taufik quite rightly does not show any interest|pg||
nt|otoj: need to play @c correctly for going home|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
nt|josj: @D lead takes out dummy's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|josj: but after winning @HK defence can force dummy in @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
nt|josj: there we are for a "walk the coffee pot" hand|pg||
nt|josj: or the dog, whatever you prefer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
nt|josj: if you don't take all your finesses, you might go down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||
nt|josj: after the @S lead, @HA and low to the jack looks best, also for reasons of communication|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to guess what the best line is|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: well, he might realise that they won't run in OR either...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure at the same line as me.Normaly I would have comed with: This is a coffe board.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ferlema: no|pg||
nt|ferlema: que mal|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: in which case the @CK is the necessary entry|pg||
nt|josj: so it makes after all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: you might play @HA and another, hoping to avoid the ruff...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
nt|otoj: going down 1 now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trèbol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a interesting variant from u Job.|pg||

nt|josj: yes that's why I double :)|pg||
nt|otoj: with singleton in @s..or Kx.. probably I'll bid 5@c|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one grand slam deserves anoher, but this one makes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass by 12HP after pards 16HP(pres) U cant do. But they stopped well.|pg||
nt|otoj: this will going down 2 or 3..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: the quick way to beat the contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: an alien freeze ray has been launched from a spaceship over sumatra|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK, in 30 seconds if nothing changes i decree that W has to play in 5H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else 2NT never would have comed.|pg||
nt|josj: well, sooner or later the finesse of the @H9 would have been necessary had it not come down in the second round of the suit|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you Joto|pg||
nt|otoj: need to return @h for guarantee down 1|pg||
nt|otoj: club return will do as well|pg||
pc|s5|nt|westjava: sry all,no info from operator for previous board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: now he has to take all @S finesses which he will duly do, I assume|pg||
nt|josj: maybe better to play opener for @DA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else he have a problem.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: But only by there HP fit. Did they know?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Often as here 3 (4) @S and a singleton.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came by 4@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am to slow specs. A bit sorry for that.|pg||
nt|josj: play is slow, maybe?|pg||
nt|josj: Kalimantan missed the slam but at least, they end up in a playable contract and will thus register their first imps of the match|pg||
nt|otoj: well defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: good alternative: giving up another @D and throwing the @S|pg||
nt|josj: so @C and @DK now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be easy I belive but....|pg||
nt|josj: after the previous board, nothing is easy for E|pg||
nt|rodal f: But seems as @C need to be 2-2 for that. So a thinking anyway.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ferlema: con el pik repartido 3/3 hay 11 bazas|pg||
pc|h8|nt|josj: well, 3@D must have shown something...|pg||
nt|josj: the easiest way to continue now is to drop the @CK doubleton - a matter of restricted choice once N follows suit with the @C10 first|pg||
nt|josj: 1 extra trick for declarer: still 2 more to go...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: @D 4-3 is enough|pg||
nt|josj: they have been playing at lightning speed all day|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive something simulare will give NS a push or +|pg||
pc|h7|nt|otoj: it seems EW is using udca|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: We are a bit too Job:)|pg||
nt|otoj: going down 5 if W takes @ha|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: now the long club might produce extra trick  2|pg||
nt|josj: declarer should probably have ducked the @CJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|josj: Declarer will settle for -1 I think with the ruffing finesse in @C|pg||
nt|otoj: Sacul throws away a trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Together with 22@C y|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|josj: it matters from which side you are looking at it, anyway ...|pg||

nt|westjava: skip to board 22|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|josj: @CA first would have improved declarer's chances|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  Hi Liliek:)|pg||

nt|don_kapu: ;|pg||
nt|josj: EW should reach a @D partial here, their best spot|pg||

nt|josj: 2@D GF relay, I assume|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hello west:)|pg||
nt|josj: an amusing hand as N's running suit runs a lot better than S's|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|westjava: selamat siang (afternoon)|pg||
nt|josj: but it's also an Indonesian island just off Singapore|pg||
nt|otoj: yes.. west denied majors..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: I think S should bid 3@D and not 2 NT without a @C stop|pg||
nt|josj: the proper contract reached but the trumps are breaking slightly unlucky for declarer|pg||
pc|c7|nt|westjava: how about your team,don?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: they did in fact reach 7D onprvious hand|pg||
nt|josj: yes, for us it matters less :)|pg||

nt|josj: well, here it's early morning and in LA it's yesterday, I presume :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Up at a deal by mates again. 1NT at 4th hand tell?|pg||
nt|josj: on paper, this contract has no chance but now, I would guess it will make|pg||
nt|josj: pretty impossible for E to find the @DA @DQ lead...|pg||
nt|josj: only -1 possible now|pg||
nt|josj: S will be happy with 3@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: now N bid 3@D ,but is it forcing fter the revers?|pg||
nt|josj: on this lead, it willbe quickly over|pg||
nt|otoj: Declarer needs to guess club|pg||
nt|josj: not enough defensive communication to set the contract but you can go down, as Joto suggests|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Seems hard. The wourst card of for NS is the @CQ|pg||

nt|otoj: 3NT will go down on @s lead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Jos:) Hope u didn't take it privat.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andyv:  yes, still Monday for another 19 minutes:)|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster to Sulut on board 19, they play 7@D dbl!!|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as S liked the minor "normaly showd" EW|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|josj: N is running into trouble...|pg||
nt|josj: forced to discard a @D which may induce declarer to guess wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: Indonesia 48th Championships 2010, Inter Province Round-10, 24 Provinces devided in Pool A and Pool B|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|s2|nt|don_kapu: have u get some information about board no 4 mr west|pg||
nt|otoj: well defense by N|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|westjava: incl you?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marcsmith: CA C ruff and a diamond gives declarer a chance now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: years ago|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|marcsmith: multi only works in inverse proportion to the level of your opponents|pg||

mb|2D|nt|josj: dinner right now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a bit fun to look at NS cards in the beginning. BUT....|pg||
nt|josj: interesting hand: on the "obvious" @SK lead you make 7@H|pg||
nt|josj: partscore battle, to be won by NS perforce|pg||
nt|josj: if N introduces his suit at any time|pg||
nt|josj: N will find a disappointing dummy and so will West|pg||
nt|otoj: How to bid 6@h.. which easily been made.. |pg||
nt|westjava:   19 7@D dbl-5 but they call director,that's why score not yet compared|pg||
nt|rodal f: S. P fist|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||
nt|josj: but it needs a @D ruff in  front of dummy to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|westjava: 1@C strong - 1@D - dbl (5-8)|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  probably 2@s here|pg||
nt|andyv:  followed by @d raise|pg||
nt|josj: and 5@D is the wrong spot to be|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N whould bid 4NT to suggest a twosuiter;|pg||
nt|josj: if he gets 5@C, 5@D willl the show the reds|pg||
nt|josj: 5@D looks reasonable enough but might prove difficult on a @C force defence |pg||
nt|josj: strong club  by W|pg||
nt|josj: 1NT F1R|pg||
nt|otoj: will EW bid 6@h? do you want a bet Pak Liliek?|pg||
nt|westjava: I bet|pg||
nt|otoj: what is the price?|pg||
nt|westjava: some launch or dinner:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: first*|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: assuming 1@D is Precisio, here we have the disadvante of it|pg||
nt|josj: tage|pg||
nt|otoj: a kib suggest $BBO ..|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|april7: most probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it - 3@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||
nt|josj: which may lead to 3NT..|pg||
nt|josj: N prefers to stay passive and will thus pay -110|pg||
nt|josj: 1NT rebid 15-17 of course |pg||
nt|josj: X showing the blacks with (maybe) some @D tolerance|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
nt|josj: or even -140|pg||
nt|josj: now|pg||
nt|josj: though this E hand is one of the uglier strong NT hands...|pg||
nt|josj: W is well advosed to pass a.s.a.p.|pg||
nt|josj: advised|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Strong Club but 2@S then was an overbid, taking the 1@D into account|pg||
nt|otoj: how about 2 $BBO?|pg||
nt|westjava: it's ok,deal:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 3@S,on the way to go...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: now the clubs seem blocked :)|pg||
nt|josj: no double, no trouble...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i get some info about board no 4, NTB get a pinalty|pg||
nt|josj: one more chance for EW here to collect a swing by just doing nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N doesn't bid NT, South probably should be weary of it.|pg||
nt|josj: yes but will he?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: How do EW pan a weak NT? I needed.|pg||
nt|josj: in 4@H there is work to do for +620 whereas 3@D is an easy 800...|pg||
nt|josj: 500 sry|pg||
nt|otoj: coffee time|pg||
nt|josj: friendly layout, helpful lead (there is no better one, I am afraid...)|pg||

nt|andyv:  nope:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C rebid by S is 9 minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes I wonder what the purpose of finding a fit is|pg||
nt|josj: not enough tricks in a @H slam|pg||
nt|josj: but not quite...|pg||

nt|westjava: back to @H a.s.a.p.:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|josj: very good lead by Fauzi...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C was MSA, I think and 3@H showed @C|pg||
nt|josj: good idea, Joto|pg||
nt|rodal f: r. I saw it wrong. 2@H was obvious at S.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: S trying to find out about the remote chance of a @D slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  wow... I guess he does|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might some fun to come anyway. N don't like his @C and press S.|pg||
nt|rodal f: That wrong I was:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT is a lucky make with @C blocked and @DQ coming down|pg||
nt|westjava: some revoke,you mean?|pg||
nt|josj: I can see 7 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: I loose my BB$...|pg||
nt|otoj: I think 3@s can't be a natural bid for that sequence.. no reason|pg||
nt|westjava: yup|pg||
nt|westjava: Keng Hin need a cup of coffee|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  or they have some other type of understandings about this sequence|pg||
nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N realised there was no room fo too many S cards in S hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Adi may have noticed the previous NT (board 4) and decided not to take a chance:)|pg||
nt|josj: -2...next|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: closing |pg||
nt|rodal f: Isit that lucky by %?|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe still 800...|pg||
nt|josj: it mght be difficult for declarer to get rid of all his @D losers|pg||
nt|josj: so I think he will go down|pg||
nt|josj: as Franky will score an overruff or two...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have any heard "them self or pard" bid the cards 2 times?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: in % it should be called very lucky|pg||
nt|rodal f: Com si com sa. But I agree it u. Ure end by bidding would have been?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
nt|josj: on the @SK lead, 5@D is through|pg||
nt|josj: if def. play @S after cashing their @D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|april7: the J of @H makes the game if opponents lead trumps in 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, game makes here, but it does not seem a major crime to miss it |pg||
nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||
nt|april7: but I think the vulnerability makes it worthwile|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the West hand is hard to evaluate - 5332 shape, three small clubs|pg||

pc|c3|nt|westjava: a strange lead!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  when pd bid 2@c I assumed W would take some aggressive action (like 4@c) and force NS to play in one of their red suits.|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt in N works|pg||
nt|josj: dd that is :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|westjava: this semi final play 2 x 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, they played 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: NS heading towards slam here so the play might be relevant...|pg||
nt|josj: I think Taufik will win the match for his team if he makes this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might me who don't understand anything here.|pg||
nt|josj:  17 is a big swing to Geo|pg||
nt|josj: 2 overtricks and maybe 3|pg||
nt|westjava: still on the safe level I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|josj: except on a @D lead by W (which I expect)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ws 1NT was?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u trust ure pard when u play Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: well, W's 1@S kept NS out of their 4-4 fit but 3NT is a safe spot|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|josj: no,  17 is a surprise push|pg||
nt|josj: but still, Taufik has to make; if he goes down, his side loses the lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|don_kapu: maybe -1 westjava|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|josj: in OR, declarer got a club lead and then successfully ran the @HJ which held...|pg||
nt|otoj: plus 1.. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: % for a honor+1 in @C is 16.2. But is it the A or Q now?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: A or J I ment. Sr.|pg||
nt|josj: off we go... (one off, that is)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Bookmark this for a bit help: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not EW used weak NT before by there card? And now 16 + full X for it?|pg||
nt|josj: but with the @H friendly, 4@S would not have been in any danger|pg||
nt|josj: now W will establish his @D|pg||
nt|josj: EW can even make 3nt DD but 3@C will go down on a @S ruff whereas bidding 3nt is a bridge too far|pg||
nt|josj: so getting plus might be OK for EW|pg||
nt|josj: good defence, should be -2 now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's routine technique for expert players NOT to ruff with the 3|pg||

pc|s8|nt|marcsmith: if 4H makes,so does 6D|pg||

nt|josj: not much more needed than the @H finesse through opener...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It does on a club lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: 6NT is the best place to be, for various reasons|pg||
nt|rodal f: But how to bid it after 1@S?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: best chance of 12 tricks and least chance of a defensive ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|josj: game depending on the @C break, vul. it's worthwhile to bid it (over 37%)|pg||

nt|josj: not|pg||
nt|josj: well over 12.89 % Roland :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Even 5 can might be hard.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: now 2NT from North presumably|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway 5@D is safe.|pg||
nt|rodal f: for u now Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D was a Flannery variation|pg||
nt|josj: showing 4-5 in majors and a normal opening hand|pg||
nt|westjava: 3rd hand,don|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if Lasut pass, Herman shd bid 2@D|pg||
nt|don_kapu: agree westjava|pg||
nt|westjava: should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @D6 to be an entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 1NT rebid now shows 15-17 as NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|josj: seems to be Roland Wald's pet convention :)|pg||
nt|josj: 15-17 1NT rebid again|pg||
nt|josj: no flexibilities needed for the overtrick|pg||
nt|josj: 78%|pg||
mb|4D|nt|josj: what happened in OR? I cannot believe this result...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D and 2@D was inverted minor it seems. I use it when I have 5.|pg||
nt|otoj: I prefer to overcall 1NT with instead of 2@c.. however it's depending on the range of their NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: why not?|pg||
nt|josj: like they did in the 1st segment, Tobing-Asbi miss a non-vul. game|pg||
nt|josj: so Precision's garbage 1@D once again made it difficult for NS to compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I can think of thousands of players who would go down after spade, spade|pg||
nt|josj: :) :(|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: or 3NT , sorry|pg||
nt|april7: will end up in 3NT and S has to guess everything especially after a @C lead, but W will lead @H mostprobably|pg||
nt|andyv:  just curious if some restrict themselves to only the minor can be longer|pg||
nt|josj: occasionally, you hold a 7-6|pg||
nt|josj: maybe the board is misplaced on the table|pg||
nt|josj: good lead, W will probably settle for 8 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhu: rotate board|pg||
nt|josj: as I thought...|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: North held South's hand and West held East's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so this is probably going to make at an important stage of this short match|pg||
nt|josj: but even then, it might be difficult to avoid getting a 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: nice X by W|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but those you always know wha to do:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: I just wander where N found his exstra by the bad 14H?|pg||
nt|josj: after the positive response, E immediately went after the aces|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C shows a decent suit and something more than that|pg||
nt|don_kapu: difficult decision for Manoppo|pg||
nt|josj: though, with 3@H on for EW, it does not matter that much|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ruffing with @D3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baldjean: which will give declarer a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East must have been quite close to opening 2@C, if that option is available|pg||
nt|josj: to beat this, a quick @H shift is needed|pg||
nt|josj: good lead for the def.|pg||
nt|westjava: Hardy cooling down on this hand...|pg||
nt|josj: good lead but irrelevant...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sacul as a bit p.. here?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: 2@D GF relay|pg||
nt|josj: over 3@H, 5@D looked a good alternative with QJ and an ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: I understand S by the bid. Hard to see the nice fit.|pg||
nt|josj: good they did...|pg||
nt|josj: so they duplicate the 2nd best OR result here|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C overcall, 6 cards for me or good 5 cards|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|josj: he was taking an advanced save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H often a easy raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing for EW|pg||
nt|josj: declarer left to his own resources|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Wmade the 5. Best I hoped fore.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As it is here, you can afford to ruff low because hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|josj: FRanky will ruff higher, I expect|pg||

pc|dK|nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
