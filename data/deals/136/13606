nt|iceking: one down looks about right here for push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So everybody managed to bid on the first board - they are too high, but 3@D was probably a make|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi all|pg||
nt|iceking: W 3h bid was very limited as competive bid with serious 3h bid he could have bid 3D as Nunes 2club showed Diamonds|pg||
nt|iceking: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|askgaard: 3@h can be set more than one time|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, welcome back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ciao a tutti, bienvenuti|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
nt|daman: All of these players have names that would look good on a bottle of Italian wine|pg||
nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|daman: the systems are skewed at times so we will have to guess on occasion|pg||
nt|daman: so    if NS play a weak NT   that's what they will open|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: tah dH|pg||
nt|daman: dah|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
nt|daman: obviously not a transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
nt|daman: South will continue to compete over 2@H|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: West luckily has an out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||

pc|dT|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: NS we always going to make 3@D     so they need to beat this 2 to get a push|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|2S|an|weak|nt|cuttysark: Never easy to lead x from Kx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can hardly ask East to lead a low spade|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: they might reach 7h its possible|pg||
nt|askgaard: 6@d is probably the best contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, you can make 7@H, but how to get there, and if you do, will you make it|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: yes most save slam |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The inteverntion makes it tough, but the sound 1-level opening style will help |pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt you can make at the table |pg||
nt|askgaard: 6@h is potentially in trouble after a spade lead|pg||
nt|iceking: yes its almost the same spot play 6h or 7h|pg||

mb|6D|nt|cuttysark: Me too - I think i can handle that one :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: It seems north has never shown his heart support - it's often right to insist on playing in such a strong suit as his diamonds|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, less boring now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: North is going to drive them to some slam|pg||
nt|daman: guaranteed|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 2NT with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: welcome aboard buddy|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S   is not on my radar|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||
nt|daman: he will take hois 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: of course north felt there was too much danger his side was getting stolen from|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|daman: that's the sound on BBO when you claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a push for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: both slams make but diamonds safer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|daman: I guess he could bid 5@H asking for a @C control|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike  and thanks for joining|pg||
nt|daman: or Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike, good to see you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening from rainy London|pg||
nt|daman: what should he do if he bids 4NT and partner shows 2 with the Queen?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: ah   my other option   asks for a @C control|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|daman: now   South should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Not what North had in mind |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: something went wron|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the dreaded fake reverse by North got them in hot water|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: not once did North show @H support|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: and the got away with it     a @S lead would have been embarrassing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you wonder if 1@H-2@D-2@h-3@D is forcing |pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: I guess N was a good hand for Fit Jump if such on card|pg||

nt|cuttysark: North led a spade in the other room, fo reasons unknown|pg||
nt|iceking: north led spade in closed room |pg||
nt|iceking: north in closed room new W had 8 cards in minors so picked spade not so strange maybe|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Do't think Fantoni will fall for that one|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Still usually best t elad a 5carder rather tan Axxx|pg||
nt|iceking: i wonder what this bidding means|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: After all, East had shown at least one major|pg||
nt|askgaard: Me too Magnus, why not 3NT directly?|pg||
nt|iceking: no idea for me this is game choice with 5hearts this bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: maybe 2c was stayman|pg||
nt|iceking: explained as any invit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Some sort of checkback I imagine|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Are we safe at this level giving pd 7 or so?" - no.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, ypu suspect Fantoni-Nunes will find 6@D or 6@H at the other table |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: but JTxx sets|pg||
nt|daman: well    they have other issues as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, got out cheaply for 5.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|daman: or does that really show the majors lol|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chick: X is very likely a support double, showing 3 card spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, either the double was penalties, in which case north should pass, or it wasn't, in which case lauria shouldn't double|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|peachy: North has a normal diamond lead, IMO|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Norberto Bocchi interview at http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/2010%e2%80%99s-europeans-norberto-bocchi-talks-about.html|pg||
nt|daman: longest suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: then they defeat the contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
nt|daman: now  it will make10 tricks|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|h_karluk: like an everyday one|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wow, I've never been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if they can get there after the opening bid|pg||
nt|daman: North should at least make a try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N can easy dictate|pg||
nt|daman: maybe South should have bid 2@D and then 4@S    unless that shows a different hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3A, 2K should not be hard to visualize|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d really nice|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: both vul, any attempt by NS pair could be dicey|pg||

nt|peachy: North chose to show his 15-17.  |pg||
nt|daman: I would too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: ssh off record - play the King :-p|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@H what I would want my opps to do with N.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Is South related to Benito Bianchi, Blue Team regular in the 1970's? |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: Garozzo is East at the othe table |pg||

nt|henryb:  I know this may be supposed to be Italian commentary, but would you prefer English to none?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will speak english for now (since my italian is horrible) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at bidding not sure what 2 @D was |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H was definitely a bit wet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about that....North might have shown some semblace of spade support at some stage|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: reason : if underlead by Q just shake his hand, opening leader didn't, then that's most probably a try to subterfuge for you|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|henryb:  I will have to figure out the bidding along with the rest of you.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know they have special system but ..... |pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand 1@d-1@s. beyond that I have no idea|pg||
nt|daman: I would play on @Ds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: especially when opps are in the middle of an artificial sequence (i assume 1@D was some sort of relay)|pg||
nt|athene: you can really give them problems if you pre-empt before they actually get around to bidding their suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam there|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @c defense|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the time he was debating between a career as a football player and a bridge pro|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge pro might last longer |pg||
nt|sybarra: less injuries |pg||
nt|athene: but as a practical measure, when you have that east hand and partner opens, and opps are bidding hearts, you are asking an awful lot of partner if you get cute with control bids|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Jim|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|daman: both pairs play weak NT|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bid slam, or blackwood, or something that makes west's life a bit easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we talking about a hand only 4 losers after west opened?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Forcing pd to bypass 5@S to either control bid at 6 level or blast slam -- I'm with you, it was time to get realistic..|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what's the problem finding slam ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes and the small doubletons weren't even in opps' suit, which might give you some pause|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: or so it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome to Joe Shair |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think even east would ask 4N over 2@h could stop in 5 <worst scenario>|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@C|pg||
mb|4D|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|daman: Italians cuebid  A  k  or singleton normally|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if weak nt, pretty frisky slam try by south|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heart values were obv w opps, so even 11 easy to visualize|pg||
nt|daman: I suppose he might find the perfect hand 1 out of 1000 times|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: off 4 tricks on power|pg||
nt|daman: 5 tricks on ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whew, you had me worried there for a moment...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|daman: this will bring them to a grinding halt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Fortunately for them. 5 should make|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Nice little @S Q-J.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 5 is in jeopardy, but the 3c bid should help with the h guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: as I predicted    a @D lead on Board 3 would have beat 3NT    Fantoni led it in the OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually no real guess, since takes h out|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: they lead a @S here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: quite an effective lead though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: well always winner QTx/Ax , K with declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT by North was quite aggressive|pg||
nt|daman: yes Jim  5 is perfectly safe|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer can have a sigh of relief, makes now regardless of how hearts are|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  with the @cQ onside, declarer should make at least 3@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: @h finesse fails, prospects bleak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still down|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem odd, but what other explanation is there for 4@S?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: maybe he was thinking that south would just double then bid 3@D second round with a diamond hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: on power|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: looks like 3@C initiated a sign-off sequence|pg||
nt|athene: so double then double then diamonds isn't that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: maybe, what i am sure 1@s didn't promise a rose garden, and 11 with a stiff in vul vs nonvul 2N "weird"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently 3@C asked for shortage, 3@H showed x@D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|jcwla: But I still don't see a jump to 4@S.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: 2NT was a spade raise with a singleton somehere|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: 2 morra tricks @cK and @d A for defenders, no where to park that losers|pg||

nt|h_karluk: do we know where is @h A?|pg||
nt|athene: do we care, if south is declarer?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Redouble by North over the double would be to play, strong-ish 5-card suit|pg||

pc|sT|nt|robinswr: easier to beat 3hearts than 2hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|Walddk2: I think Fulvio is heading for the grand after partner showed a maximum 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think they are headed for 6@D, don't expect them to bid 7 - no need when they have not reached slam at all in the other room|pg||
nt|robinswr: bad grand if opponents are in game|pg||
nt|askgaard: 'Max, 4+@d', this must sound nice to north|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: OK Liz, we shall see who's right|pg||
nt|askgaard: Would a grand make here? I think not|pg||
nt|askgaard: Declarer might play on ruffing three hearts in dummy, but that will create a trump loser|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, specs they do not know the result in the other room, but if you reach a slam like this you can be pretty sure you will pick up points|pg||
nt|askgaard: In that case it could end up with some kind of trump coup though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not so sure, Liz. How would you be feeling when your partner opens 1@D and you have that North hand? Slammy I am sure|pg||
nt|askgaard: I sort of hope they get to 7, just for the excitement of it|pg||
nt|askgaard: Very interesting contract 7@d|pg||

nt|wygbe1: 7d possible here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but it all ended happily :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: 3@S was not my choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and a funny superaccept, as i thought they will nicely land to 4@s, however @d lead will hurt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @c by south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, would 2NT be clubs and diamonds or simply natural? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: what are they trying to accomplish/|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: specs suggest 2 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Di Lauria forced Angelini to play 7, as declarer he did his hard homework|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i suspect they are trying to make surprises for us|pg||
nt|daman: 2 after this|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are all wrong |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: with one of my pards 2NT there would be 6@C4@d  |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and we still have 3 boards|pg||
nt|peachy: can't really hurt to bid 3D on the way, assuming 3D is forcing for them|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good time to play 2s over 2h as a one round force|pg||
nt|peachy: This is no way to catch up, from behind|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: this bidding is like a Tuesday at the club|pg||

nt|santyclz: Always a pleasure when your hand matches your agreements.|pg||
nt|santyclz: My partners are grateful when my hands are remotely similar to what my bids show.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 2NT unlikely to be required as a natural bid, so it made a sort of sense to attach a meaning to it. May not be the best one, of course|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 7@s+2 aces+@cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dd solution|pg||
nt|athene: this must have good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in practice one may pull AK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: you might be able to ruff one heart, throw one on @DA, one on @CQ and so just lose @CAK, @SQ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Presume 1@H was a xfer to @SS.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: I think the first @H bid =spades |pg||

pc|d2|nt|daman: this contract is not in jeopardy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now asking if they can play 3 nt |pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: as 4@d denied club stopper 4@s normal contract|pg||
nt|athene: hard to reach hand for the club up|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff is ok i guess|pg||
nt|athene: the mistake is to throw the club on this - you need that club loser to set up your tenth winner (@CQ)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: the other line is to throw the club and ruff two hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer doesnt have a whole lot to think about here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|daman: mind you|pg||
nt|daman: this might be one way he can make it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: buckle up|pg||
nt|daman: he MUST hook the @H if they win Ace and another|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: wd|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: a bit harsh to lose to the stiff ten :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||
nt|athene: usually you expect that if you get overruffed it will be from the trump trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: @h J and claim|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|wygbe1: notice declarer's failure to lead the 9 on first round of spades left him poorly placed to finesse against south's spade jack - since suit blocked|pg||
