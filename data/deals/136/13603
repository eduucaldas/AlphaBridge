mb|2N!|an|3 or 4 !h|nt|lml: its my favorite place to visit|pg||

nt|brolucius: Probably with only three-card trump support.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|an|3!H|mb|p|nt|iceking: gambling on 3nt from his view 3h and 3nt might have same number of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: well West has every reason to prefer notrump |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: he is 4-3-3-3 and he gets to play the hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the game is on!|pg||
nt|iceking: well he is playing with one of the best declerar in the world i might think about be dummy alot |pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing the hand is not much of an advantage when your partner is Versace.|pg||
nt|jbgood: so what is the best lead, a club or a diamond?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has guessed the wrong minor.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||

nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||

pc|sA|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||

nt|brolucius: You could lose a double-game swing by passing 4@H.|pg||
nt|lml: yes it can work out badly|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed this vul i just thing pass is a losing stragety|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bumping their 420 to 590 is not very costly, and the gain is huge when you have a vulnerable game your way. Or when you push them one level higher. |pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: the problem isnt just losing 5 imps ... you could go for a number if West is better|pg||
nt|lml: that is the pressure of the 4@H bid|pg||
nt|iceking: many would open this south hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|iceking: 1h p 1nt all pass probably coming up|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I prefer 1NT to 2@C too.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: w has a tough lead probably has to lead low spade |pg||
nt|jbgood: .. 2 @s not everybody's choice.., S is a passed hand after all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Indeed. A strange sequence.|pg||
nt|iceking: spade ten diamond then spade this will go few down i predict|pg||
nt|lml: they lost the positive of having south pass in the first place (limiting his hand)|pg||
nt|iceking: in closed room Lauria opened 1nt probably 10-12 nt |pg||
nt|brolucius: Just as well they did bid 3NT, though, with South having pocketed +400 at the other table.|pg||
nt|iceking: S bid this hand on his own he had a clear 1nt respond as i see it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|iceking: even he guesses hearts now still 5 losers|pg||
nt|lml: I can think of no way to make more than 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: his best shot is a heart to the 10 and then some kind of defensive miscue|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|iceking: heart to ten win ace low spade and its over |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: yes if they do that |pg||

mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, either the double was penalties, in which case north should pass, or it wasn't, in which case lauria shouldn't double|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Hi Cornelia, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Daniela|pg||
nt|daman: a very intelligent auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: if you assume diamonds are 5-2, vacant places suggests the heart finesse the other way?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe, however QT9x also possible <my review, my opinion> just a1 HCP difference|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: this auction is not going well for versace so far|pg||
nt|iceking: dont like this 4sp bid better have good 3nt available here then he can qubid 4club as none serious |pg||
nt|brolucius: West was invited to cue-bid a control and he has declined.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and of course 6 NT on the W hand is always a make|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe there should be a way to force a cuebid|pg||
nt|lml: anyway there will be another try I think|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think 3 spades was just that|pg||
nt|iceking: if you play 2way stayman instead of checkback you can use 2nt here from east over 1nt as puppet to 3clubs then over 3clubs bid 3h as short and spade setting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: something went wrong with the machinery|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: East will surely blame West for not cue-bidding on his hand. Why not? |pg||

mc|12|nt|lml: bidding 4@S does not help|pg||

nt|lml: North has enough for 3@D|pg||

nt|lml: I dont like it|pg||
nt|lml: but I would still raise|pg||
nt|iceking: north will save him with 3d i guess|pg||

nt|jbgood: he really ahs to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: I like both 2@D and North's (obvious) 3@D.|pg||
nt|iceking: yes with xxx in hearts hand has potential pd might have 4sp 6d exs|pg||
nt|lml: North is not so sure its obvious|pg||
nt|brolucius: He should be!|pg||
nt|lml: a long pause and then 3@D ... probably describes the hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: It was a nice sequence. South was not strong enough to bid 3@D, surely.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 4@s vs 5@h? but vuln not friendly|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S is doomed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h - double was irrelevant|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: @c defense|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the time he was debating between a career as a football player and a bridge pro|pg||
nt|sybarra: bridge pro might last longer |pg||
nt|sybarra: less injuries |pg||
nt|athene: but as a practical measure, when you have that east hand and partner opens, and opps are bidding hearts, you are asking an awful lot of partner if you get cute with control bids|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bid slam, or blackwood, or something that makes west's life a bit easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we talking about a hand only 4 losers after west opened?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Forcing pd to bypass 5@S to either control bid at 6 level or blast slam -- I'm with you, it was time to get realistic..|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what's the problem finding slam ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes and the small doubletons weren't even in opps' suit, which might give you some pause|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: or so it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome to Joe Shair |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||

mb|2S|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||

pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: 2NT by North was quite aggressive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  with the @cQ onside, declarer should make at least 3@h|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @h finesse fails, prospects bleak|pg||

nt|h_karluk: still down|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem odd, but what other explanation is there for 4@S?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: maybe he was thinking that south would just double then bid 3@D second round with a diamond hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|daman: on power|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 3@C initiated a sign-off sequence|pg||
nt|athene: so double then double then diamonds isn't that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: maybe, what i am sure 1@s didn't promise a rose garden, and 11 with a stiff in vul vs nonvul 2N "weird"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently 3@C asked for shortage, 3@H showed x@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||

pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: 2NT was a spade raise with a singleton somehere|pg||

nt|lml: in the CR|pg||
nt|lml: hi Harmon|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: sorry, they like to show the cards each other and decide the final result together without playing|pg||
nt|jbgood: so he didnt take his 3 spades tricks?|pg||
nt|iceking: when S claimed 10 tricks i think east should give him 11 after the claim tell him i have qj stiff|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iceking: i would at least sitting east|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: they are playing with reverse board now|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphztf: Versace is now Giubilo and Pagani is now Pinguello|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: i know but its my personal view in high level game like this as S is doing this claim for both sites|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is Unusual to play 2NT as Unusual on this sequence.|pg||
nt|lml: 3@H likely showed a good hand with clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: if he thinks 2NT is natural, 3@H may be a tansfer bid...|pg||
nt|iceking: very unusual i dont remember ever see someone play 2nt here as minors it just doesnt look right|pg||
nt|lml: and actually it should really be|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: they are in a strange strange land|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|iceking: might reach lucky slam here |pg||
nt|lml: north must know something is happening|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not yet convinced about this N/S auction. (Call me Mr Skeptical).|pg||
nt|iceking: sure if 3h is forcing then s should drive to slam|pg||
nt|harmon: lucky?? it doesnt make|pg||
nt|brolucius: South might have bid 4NT on the first round, forcing a choice of minor suits.|pg||
nt|lml: for the specs who are asking... we think that south created a new auction|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lml: one the partnership doesnt play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is that North took 2NT as natural and that 3@H was a transfer|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lml: and he is hoping that he can get a minor 2 suiter across|pg||
nt|lml: north should figure it out but will he|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: They needed a relay response to 2NT. "Is that Unusual or natural?"|pg||
nt|iceking: correct 6club down |pg||
nt|lml: well done to work out that a pass is needed|pg||
nt|harmon: on a ht lead anyway|pg||
nt|lml: the opening lead is important|pg||
nt|iceking: yes makes on trump lead and spade lead needs heart for set|pg||
nt|brolucius: Disappointing bidding at both tables.|pg||
nt|lml: anything but a heart has a good shot of letting this through|pg||
nt|jbgood: such sequences often leads to a call for TD|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h 4nt overcall looks normal to me|pg||
nt|jbgood: me too|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he pulled the wrong notrump bid from the box|pg||
nt|iceking: but in closed room S overcall 3d and sure Angelini should bid 3sp over that |pg||
nt|lml: anything but a heart... lets see if west gets creative|pg||
nt|lml: he is as baffled by the auction as north|pg||
nt|brolucius: North should have responded to 3@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|iceking: just looks like a easy 4nt overcall iam supriced either of them bid it|pg||
nt|lml: huge lead here though...|pg||
nt|lml: I believe you lead a heart here and trust partner who didn't double|pg||

nt|h_karluk: more counting - a must !|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is any signalling system yet invented that assures partner with 100% certainty you have a particular card :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: nine tops in 3NT for EW here, may be awkward to reach |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|daman: South will compete for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: Lanzarotti&Buratti once a very strong pairs, seems their ban lifted, however they didn't stop to register festivals as a pro pair|pg||
nt|daman: since North did not open a weak 2/multi    he is stuck|pg||
nt|daman: does 3@S show a @H tolerance?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: they built up a system aptly named "nightmare"|pg||
nt|daman: all his partner did was overcall   and now they are commited beyond 3@H    which could be a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he has a collection shouts speak now or remain silence at all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does this pair play Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not opposite a passed hand anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bocchi thinking of stepping in?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: i guess Massimo would try for a slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be. And double would be music to Madala's ears|pg||
nt|athene: EW do seem to always bid the next step up when they have a good hand, so it's some sort of relay system of doom|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: still a hope maybe Vittorio pulls |pg||
nt|daman: such a weird hand|pg||
nt|athene: lauria will fall asleep unless east bids diamonds, in which case he might double for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: nice lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems @sK lead would work well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala almost has best hand at the table |pg||
nt|santyclz: Too rich for my blood.  2@ds seems about right.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  what's this almost bit white woman? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he knows he will be the opening leader|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|daman: on balance    this is the best lead   because S bid 4@D|pg||
nt|daman: they have no tricks on the side other than trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but you know @sK already hooked, so why not @h A with p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case you score 3 trumps and hope a trick on an side suit|pg||
nt|daman: it's hard to decide if that is enough     you need 4 tricks to beat it|pg||
nt|daman: the peril is if North had AQJxxx       but then he would have opened|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: when your stiff @sK obviously hooked @h lead really passive, best to look for a ruff|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: missed endplay|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: weak N in action|pg||

mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: 23/17 and interesting partscore battle|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from north now shows his hand perfectly well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess responsive double also an option|pg||
nt|athene: doubling when you can make a descriptive bid is a bit cruel to poor partner|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might think EW are in trouble|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i know that's sort of a bee on your bonnet bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||

nt|athene: eight tricks are easy, assuming you find the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: the question is how to make nine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say as N you doubled, in case EW buys 1N that's Xmas for your side, if not still you can afford to buy it at 2 level in unbid suits|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really have a suit they can attack so maybe you just plod away with the diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: well, you are 6421 |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: very tough now      North has the spots in @Hs to staunch the threat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however @sA wrong placed|pg||

nt|daman: he is skewered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sKj at table prospects are not bright for East|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would balance Shirley. Especially at imps|pg||

nt|iceking: and S is little stuck has some values|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: might try 3sp |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Even so, he can hardly bid 2NT, can he? No, 3@D (with a bit to spare) seems right.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|santyclz: Same as on the prior hand, I'd sacrafice the @H suit to accent the most positive feature of my hand and downplay my defensive potential.|pg||

nt|athene: i think we need two passes then this auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think West is supposed to start with 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: either that or they put the board on the table rotated through 180 degrees|pg||
nt|athene: that's most likely actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N off to a small @s lead or @sQ|pg||

nt|brolucius: West's 1@D does promise 4+ diamonds, I am told.|pg||

nt|iceking: he might be defending 4h making when 6clubs is claim |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and that was 2 way, somehow inspired|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be fun |pg||
nt|athene: if you have oodles of HCP and two trick sources, you sometimes want to play in notrumps because then even if one suit breaks badly you survive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both finesses are onside|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|daman: they will not get to the cold slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for NS |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|athene: but if that's your trump suit with two losers, it doesn't matter if you have 15 winners elsewhere|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S some kind of diamond raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h singleton?|pg||

nt|daman: they have lost the @D suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|daman: in North America    we ipen the South hand 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: either 6@h+3@c+1@d+3@s or finesse to @d K brings 13 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: as a general game-force?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: they have got quite high under their own steam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA lead would be very friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have good vlaues, so perhaps it is unrealistic for them to stop low |pg||
nt|daman: open*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tartan 2?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Now he wants to bid 4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: stayman or transfer than new suit GF|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: opening 1@C seems weird to me|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|sybarra: so I do not go to track to day |pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: if 4NT was RKCB then 5NT asked for kings, so 6@D looks like one side king - but showing just the number of kings isn't much use so i can't believe that's what they are doing|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: another breakpoijnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Nor I.  I never expected a pass.|pg||

nt|athene: looks as though south thought 6@D=@DK|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just works out the grand might be excellent and at worst will be on a finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mega difference of Di Lauria - world grandmasters ranking top 4 <best placing points owner> a living saga!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: i think he thought 3N disaster, then pushed|pg||
nt|athene: three options:- a) finesse @D (works)  b) finesse @S (works) c) play for @S-@D squeeze (doesn't work)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you might try to ruff the diamonds good as well|pg||
nt|athene: (throw dummy's diamond on the @CQ and ruff a diamond or two)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: The Law says to bid 3@s (nine trumps) but maybe with his soft values he was afraid EW might bid a missed game|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If all bridge hands were balanced, the game would be boring. There are many combinations resulting from the deal of 52 cards. Many have weird shapes.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|athene: the other line is to throw the club and ruff two hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: mind you|pg||
nt|daman: this might be one way he can make it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: buckle up|pg||
nt|daman: he MUST hook the @H if they win Ace and another|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: the problem is always how to get back to hand safely|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: easy now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: wd|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: a bit harsh to lose to the stiff ten :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||
nt|athene: usually you expect that if you get overruffed it will be from the trump trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h J and claim|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|s5|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: several specs are of course pointing out he didn't need to ruff the heart that east played into his @HAQ|pg||

nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set |pg||
nt|h_karluk: last board|pg||
nt|athene: then the trump finesse would have been sort of marked|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: same here|pg||
nt|daman: what happened to the 1@D opener?|pg||
nt|daman: 5@Ds and Kx of @Cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the hand we begin with 1@d|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|athene: sorry, i was in the middle of dinner, and missed approximately 90% of the interest in the play of that hand :) but it does seem declarer was a bit mad if that was indeed how it ...|pg||
nt|athene: went|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   and http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php also http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all are very nice ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: don't see that North can do much over this|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: given layout 4@d very easy for EW|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yup rt|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs whose comments keep us on the straight and narrow |pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess 1@S was F|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|daman: well done|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has to bid 3@S now, I guess - not sure of the ramifications here |pg||
nt|athene: this won't take long|pg||
nt|athene: not once the @SQ appears anyway|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Daniela, Jordan, William, good work|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: good decision|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: auto -1, aggressive try|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: not match ponts so this is not the worse spot |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@S makes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what is going through his mind?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: God knows:)|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the @D 9?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike |pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: looks a bit odd to throw the spades from dummy|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: you are just going to cash, but don't you want your 12th trick when the @SQ falls?|pg||
nt|athene: ok maybe he didn't throw that many spades|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all, some interesting hands there :)|pg||
