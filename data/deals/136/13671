mb|1H|mb|p|nt|benjent: The dealing gods are giving us a bit of shape early...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Here you are with your 20 balanced and no defence against 4@S|pg||
nt|jron: a difficult rebid with Ns hand|pg||
nt|jron: 2@d, 2@h and 2s all possible|pg||
mb|r!|nt|Vugraph814: rdbl = 3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bilde led a trump (best) next door, but not enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jron: RD showing 3@s|pg||
nt|jron: Bjarnarson will end it bidding 4@s|pg||
nt|benjent: He may end it by passing out 4@sX :)|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: I am surprised Bilde was so silent in the other room ... 20 hcp :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|jron: you might be right :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: Bilde only dbl contracts he can beat!|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: thats a very good rule !!|pg||
nt|benjent: Schaltz will be pleased it only makes 10 :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|jron: A spade lead stands out when you´re this strong|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|benjent: You can be sure they're not pitching anything in a hurry|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jron: No obvious line for declarer|pg||
nt|benjent: Probably run @cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get off dummy after that?|pg||
nt|benjent: Alternative of @h up works pretty well, as if turns out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart seems better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know where the ace is|pg||
nt|jron: I think he will lead a heart|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: The TD and I are very pleased that Gregers takes his time .. the other table has only played 2 boards so far ... 15 minutes pr. board :) |pg||
nt|benjent: If you choose to play on @c's, you get off dummy by running @dQ ditching a @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seniors are not so fast|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|sJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then you are a trick short, Ben|pg||
nt|jron: That doesn´t leave you with enough tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C9 does not drop|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: running a @d ... then Gregers is down on a @s return?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|benjent: He doesn't know that @h's are 3-3 at trick 2 either!|pg||
nt|jron: declarer is on his way down, I think|pg||
nt|benjent: And he doesn't know yet that @s's are 3-2|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|benjent: Easy game for us looking at all 4 hands, not so easy for the single dummy declarer trying to avoid puh-lenty off|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The play will be very fast in this match I predict. Nothing really to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GT are 50 miles ahead|pg||
nt|lestergold: gross overbid auction in closed|pg||
nt|pelu: both pairs play naturel - NS Morten Bilde - Jørgen Hansen 4 card openings|pg||
nt|pelu: hej alle - et opgør mellem to af de danske EM-hold|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone from Los Angeles|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 4@s by EW on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and David|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning |pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Johanne, our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 ladies around the table|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm David|pg||
nt|vugraph815: goodmorning everyone :)  we are starting now.|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: Only thing that can go wrong here is EW get too high I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 1NT-12-14|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|ftpe: hi Peter and Niels and specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we really starting the auction this way?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: easy fame for e/w to start   either 4@S  or 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  lack of fits should slow them down|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Well, that's interesting. My long-long-long Thompson ancestor is actually supposed to be a Norwegian Thomassen who jumped ship in Australia in the early 1800s - now I understand ...|pg||
nt|benjent: the -sen|pg||
nt|asig: 2@d shows a weak major|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h skal en ned, mens der skal spar ud for at sætte 5@d|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: a pgantom part score save absurd|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos n/s cant make 3@s even|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably canty make 2|pg||
nt|ady: nust have misguessed the heart position CR to go down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oddur's approach was odd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2!@s 2@h  dim and club to lose with this horrible duplication|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already showed a sound heart raise, and then he bid game laterr after partner showed nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Something is wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Denmark Open are N-S in both rooms|pg||
nt|asig: Dbl is 'cards', I guess|pg||
nt|asig: 2@h asks partner to bid his major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D suit as it is, the stolen bid for transfer.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, this is a bit better|pg||
nt|garnetts: weak no trump then |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pelu: this is the 2. pound of training for the danish national players - 10 team in totel - incl 2 team from Norway|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  hi there|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 3@h|pg||
nt|ady: west might do well to defend with his 20 pts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very uneven distribution of points, 20 for NS and 20 for W alone.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: i was thinking of making the same pun but i thought ikt too corny|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But not a word about Eyjafjallajökull, Ben|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S quite aggressive by East   |pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen... showing 5@s and 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4@s should end the auction|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: already 2 tricks too high|pg||
nt|pelu: In Open room they strat with board 9 and 10, so we cant exp comperations|pg||
nt|roswolf: on that lead there doesnt seem to be a problem|pg||
nt|vugraph815: we'll rotate the players after this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ben knows how to pronounce it now. He has seen a video I sent him|pg||
nt|benjent: There are a surprising number of t's in it !!!|pg||
nt|asig: Only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W upgraded the hand and 3NT should not make as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H was a better bid, to play.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article/30064564/|pg||
nt|mr murray: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW NT range looks to be 12-15 type or 11-14 with this vul|pg||
nt|garnetts: 11 tricks look cast iron |pg||
nt|ady: west should surely lead trumps against any spade contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S may not be a problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, they both are, but this is mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|ady: undoubled here    may also be down 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear what is happening here east came in no vul after passing at 2 level|pg||
nt|mr murray: 8 loser hand.  expects a lot from partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west yhas a balanced hand with a few high cards no hope for game but defensive chances|pg||
nt|ady: even a diamond ruff wont beat this   even if East plays K@D|pg||
nt|vugraph815: its going good :) yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: at ;least not doubled they gain|pg||
nt|mr murray: they could have gained 200 more if they defended 3 spades down 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ducked|pg||
nt|roswolf: to preserve a certain entry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One may wonder how they are going to play good bridge in Belgium when they are not even capable of finding their seats :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah advanced play!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No dbl by W-very wise.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: hearts lay kindly|pg||
nt|ady: west maay alter defence when heart is played and force dummy to ruff   |pg||
nt|rnmalik: requires play no doubt-may not be that easy as it looks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trump a superior play.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|ppiglett: Four clubs two hearts and a spade - but hard to get them|pg||
nt|ftpe: probably 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|ftpe: fore NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: I like that @DK - create problem for decl|pg||
nt|mr murray: easy partial with no real problems|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Yes Fuglestad needed a @h shift in trick 3 - not easy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yep|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: Nice 3@s by North there ... I presume 3@d was weak, so getting involved was indicated|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|garnetts: as a matter of technique and timing it looks like there will be no spade finesse --cash AK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: sorry retract that   if north plays a diamond back and easst plays the king  ace and another heart would take out the entry to the K@C to discard the losing diamond in view of ...|pg||
nt|ady: north having doubleton heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mr murray: no overtricks either|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trick two actually - needed to preserve comms|pg||
nt|ady: yes  even with hearts breaking kindly   only 9 tricks if trumps continued|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: inexplicable lack of judgement by orld class players|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe the volcanic ash has side effects|pg||
nt|mr murray: not their usual level of competance.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thye wouldnt be winning any bermuda bowls with that kind of bidding thats for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even the local club pun ch bowl|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: indeed but declarer is ok because spade ace is right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|asig: -2 now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|sJ|nt|ady: only remains for clubs to break now   |pg||
nt|mr murray: the Islandic top pairs do quite well in our National Tournaments.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Fridrik|pg||
nt|ady: if this is taken and AK diamonds xashed  and a diamond  north could be squeezed|pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|pelu: no the play for 4x@c + 2x@d + 3x@h|pg||
nt|ftpe: well he still has heartguess|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the finesse:)|pg||
nt|ady: can make now    clubs can be et up|pg||

nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|nielsfoged:  Hansen guessed wrong in 1988|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Would E have Dbled with A,Ak,Q|pg||
nt|ftpe: i know him very well|pg||
nt|ftpe: so agree niels :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will teach me :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: well defended|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky for the declarer trumps are divided 2 and 3.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GT are hot favourites in this match, but you never know. VÍS pushed Fisk down to 5th place in the last round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisk was run over by Verðbréf  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Verðbréf  = bonds|pg||
nt|benjent: If I have the format right, there's a complete round-robin followed by a final between the top 2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nielsfoged:  0.1 sec|pg||
nt|ftpe: y :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: well that is ok too:)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 120?|pg||
nt|andyv:  as will rubber bridge:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: no|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Just a complete round-robin|pg||
nt|benjent: close?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Found an easy way out for 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|asig: 4@h is a much better contract|pg||
nt|ady: west holding ace and king of both minors should have been able to see there were only 9 tricks with a trump continuation unless south had a 2nd heart or an unlikely 6th spade in ...|pg||
nt|ady: which case he could not really do anything to beat the contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: no squeeze now mwell defended|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: And, he still had a decent shot with @c9 coming down, and he wasn't going to go a billion off trying to rely on @h's working|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|benjent: A billion off is, of course, a mild overstatement :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|Walddk2: Still better odds to play on hearts I think. AQ doubleton also good enough, you don't need them 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|Vugraph814: 1@s = relay|pg||
nt|jron: If W has Exxx in hearts you will also succeed|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: 2@h = minimum|pg||
nt|benjent: Not necessarily - and how likely is doubleton @hAQ in the pocket with the hand that made a few takeout doubles? Not so likely|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: 2@h = minimum with 5@h (5-3-3-2) or minimum with @h and a sidesuit in @s |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: And if W has EDxx of hearts there is a good chance spades are 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|benjent: I'm looking at an old system card for NS - did 1@h show @h or 14+ balanced?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jron: he is a passed hand |pg||
nt|jron: therefore always hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: right, but apart from that|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: 1@h = @h or 14+bal|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: 1@s relay|pg||
nt|jron: yes thats the way they play it|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|asig: and might make|pg||
nt|garnetts: Morning Mike |pg||
nt|mdgraham: gm David|pg||
nt|ady: good start for the Seniors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another 4@H for NS-|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1NT 12-14|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 eller 4@s fra Syd (efter 1@d)|pg||
nt|pelu: pass fra Bilde??|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d by NS to off set the 4@s by EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will be competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I saw there's a Keflavik Savings Bank team ... I hope our Icelandic friends don't take this badly but ... is that the last operating bank in Iceland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  over 2@d bid, N may just bid 5@d|pg||
nt|garnetts: East did well bidding spades first or a club lead would beat 5@S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West 4@d?|pg||
nt|ady: just 2 diamond losers in a heart contract if they are led|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So we show one of the two matches, and definitely GT vs Verðbréf  in the last round|pg||
nt|athene: clear double with south rather than 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like it on this hand 3-2-2-6 is not a good shape|pg||
nt|pelu: standard for EW :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would need play, with QJ@D and holding JT9x@H|pg||
nt|mr murray: lucky game wwhich they will probably get pushed into|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to Peter Lund, Denmark.|pg||
nt|pelu: hi raija|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't matter... N is not passing|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S next then lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North lurking|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nice 2@H by Jón|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has directed the killing lead against 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D did not even promise diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: south is max and may uopgrade bwecause of the dim bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should be wary of the heart position|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4@S   but even vul against not n/s have a save in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bids what she thinks she can make|pg||
nt|roswolf: east believes her anyway|pg||
nt|mr murray: good choice|pg||
nt|ftpe: 90|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: if the majors were exchanged, you might perhaps bid 1@S over 1@H with the south hand|pg||
nt|athene: but when opps have spades, all the other suits are equal :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tea or coffe hand if played at 4 level.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: club and club ruff also ok   can only get 1 discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: got it right!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: pass a new concept in this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Iceland/baldursson-jonsson.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Precision with Ice Relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I was surprised that there was even one left :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly believe that North is masterminding to that extent|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that's a bit surprising - perhaps North is scared of the vulnerablility|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd better not do any predicting for a while|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no super accept.|pg||
nt|ady: west might have doubled the 2@D transfer to direct the lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: yes, it looks normal to bid with that north hand over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: surprised at North's lack of action|pg||
nt|roswolf: not an adequate return for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D can contain 0 diamonds, 4405 shape|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C was a good save.|pg||
nt|asig: But this may go down|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@d koster kun 100!|pg||
nt|vugraph815: ru es havde gemt sig..|pg||
nt|pelu: Morten Bilde are desperat looking for at place to play|pg||
nt|pelu: and 2@h are the best spot|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ftpe: nice 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul must have scared N off... not sure why... she has an excellent hand for partner.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I imagine South will have somehting rude to say in Danish after this |pg||
nt|mdgraham: most players would raise partner with six-card support and a void, irespective of the vulnerability |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, back to bridge|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps she's worried that 5@D would show more, at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|pelu: in 2@H there are 5 tricks and only -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: may but should make.|pg||
nt|asig: If the defence setup a club trick and declarer misguesse diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: That's a seriously gutsy 5@h bid. Not much shape, various loose honours. Holy phantom sacrifice Batman!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H shows 6+|pg||
nt|ady: if 3@H was an invite north has an easy acceptance|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nielsfoged:  wow that is a weak 1NT (maybe special 1st seat white vs red?)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: As it happens, it's a phantom save|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a club switch|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT are a winner - but not a good contract - I cant see why N didnt X 2"h|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h|pg||
nt|pelu: hi spechts - can u explain Ns bidding?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pelu: det kan ikke være rigtigt|pg||
nt|pelu: ok, søren :)|pg||
nt|ady: east still managed to find a diamond lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mr murray: 4 spades another bad contract that makes|pg||
nt|ftpe: good spadeshift from bilde|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: None the less an interesting hand to play.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: But people tend to sacrifice every time they are NV vs Vul|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so this is going to be a very soft result for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

mb|2H|nt|benjent: Hi Jon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GT resting their anchor pair, Sigurbjörn and Magnús, in this set. They were outstanding when the crushed Málning in the previous round|pg||
nt|athene: again North with a borderline decision takes the cautious route - some would double 1@S|pg||

nt|athene: west has better than minimum, with a six-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H (assuming that's her most discouraging action) looks a little conservative|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2@S?  seems OTT to me when South has shown them |pg||
nt|garnetts: Well done |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one loser in each of sides and spade goes away if they are not attacked|pg||
nt|andyv:  too many soft points in E hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: W must be subminimum for his bid, so E will go to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is lets face it a bridge players bid- win some lose some|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: not the best contract for EW - 3@c easy win - but when u open 4 card @h then u normal rebid 2@H and not 3@c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If not wrong, 4@S a par contract on this hand.|pg||
nt|asig: yes|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East now knows they have a diamond gap |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very right misuse shall we say.|pg||

nt|ady: a look with a low spade good enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nielsfoged:  I think so (maybe even 4-4-5-0?)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mr murray: any of three spade cards to save the overtrick|pg||

pc|sK|nt|benjent: The auction feels kind of like we missed a round|pg||

nt|asig: Or even 3 rounds of @s and @hAK+ruff and a club finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another @S, @H ruff, @C finesse, so many ways to make this hand.|pg||
nt|mr murray: 2 club bid didnt help|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nielsfoged:  agree, but for North it was not easy t know if pd had @d support - actually 2@d would have been great, but not worth the risk (niether in Imps or MP)|pg||
nt|ftpe: lead gave him chance to win, but still migth go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's pd didn't bid 1N, so S should suspect that E has 4 @ss|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: but south is tryimng to beat it|pg||
nt|ady: to be faie though east has nothing wasted   2 aces in the blacks gold dust  even the 10@D useful  and the heart finesse is right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: not mps|pg||

pc|s5|nt|benjent: I have a bad feeling about this ... I wonder if declarer is going to try to drop doubleton @h honour in the South hand|pg||

mb|d|nt|mr murray: south did nothing wrong. Just we see all the cards. easy to defend from up here in skybox. :)|pg||
nt|ady: no fit n/s     will end in 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: with spades laying so nice  np problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim was on general grounds the best altho a long shot to beat contract pard could hold ace for three tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores. Gold and silver medals decided a while ago. GT has been outstanding all the way|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, missing any decent vul game should be a mild cause for concern|pg||
nt|ady: yes agreed    9H important as well|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H is making - no @c-ruff :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
nt|pelu: the standard of bidding not as good as in the afternoon -some stange mistakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pretty hefty strong NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is that what they playing MIke?  Snap|pg||
nt|andyv:  price is right for W|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: Did he in fact hop the @sA on the 2nd round, and go down 2 when there wasn't @h Hx in the pocket?|pg||
nt|ftpe: another boring board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N bound to bid now|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 he 9|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  only 8 tricks in @h with best def|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@c bid by S unless she was planning to invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer started life with ten tricks here and will probably just take them|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Yes I saw 4@h-4@s by Kofoed-MÃ¸nsted. At least a reminder for the rest of us to get that one into the system.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: 4@h makes 4, but 4@s makes 5 - and they never got a mention!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel closed room pls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sry, private|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho 4@s of course plays very well|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1  Binker go 10 imps    4@S went down to the same doubleton diamond lead and declarer played the king on diamond return and ace and another heart defeated the contgract|pg||
nt|pelu: need @D-ruff to defeat|pg||
nt|pelu: East sh overtage with @H J and play @D - but if pd has @s10 and not @DA then @H back - easy for us but diff for the players|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks simple from here|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@c -1 not a bad contract - 4@s making NS|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  I support MÃ¸nsted's 4@s as CB, but heard that others agree with Kofoed's "improving the contract (=natural)"|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think they are playing puppet here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C better.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: she was playing the lead to be @D6 from @DQ63|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt er ikke en vinder :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like puppet 2@C |pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  you may be right, David|pg||
nt|garnetts: who knows |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe a direct 3N has some other meaning (some play it as 4-4 in the majors with game values)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Curiously the club suit is well placed if North leads the 10|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: So does 6@S with all cards in view|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong|pg||
nt|mr murray: good contract|pg||
nt|mr murray: stayed away from spades which has no play|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  As usual it doesn't really matter as long as yopu play the same as partner!|pg||
nt|ftpe: how 8?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nielsfoged:  @s ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well i can count 11 Roland that 12th please explain7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@s 2@h dim and dim ruff 2 clubs is what i can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: two ruffs and he cant take spade finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can ruff two diamonds on a non-trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing just a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced by a trump switch|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also totally disgaree with the lead--what is the point?  You have on likely entry to lead a heart--and that was it |pg||
nt|andyv:  you lead the 10@d to reward partner for sticking out her neck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pard bid 2@H. She has the hearts and possible entries.  |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but tyhen he has to lose a trump trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still has a dim to lose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is not in 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: could make ona non trump lead   ruffing 2 diamonds  and ruffing twice in hand  plus heart finesse  and exiting in the end    dream land|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Duck a spade|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  here 7 in NT|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth, difficult|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: good stop after 2 negatives by E.|pg||

nt|ftpe: Men NS har 2-3 spar i kortene|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: one spade ruff not enough to beat this - overtrick available in spade game|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well roland lives in slam dreamland as we all know|pg||
nt|vugraph815: sorry, lost it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is not good|pg||
nt|andyv:  N didn't pay enough attention the the blockage problem the @c suit creates|pg||
nt|garnetts: Note that the 8@C was needed if you were intending to play the J|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Of course, making 5 now - hard for North to picture the @s ruff|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  no actually 8 also in NT|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: mix up here    north wanted south to ruff if out of diamonds and give a heart ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Anything is possible double dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: unblock @cA to disc a @D on @cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  but your point of leading the 10@c is the easiest and cleanest here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ftpe: good shift from bilde|pg||
nt|ftpe: only chance to set it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|benjent: Although ... if you check the pips, what else could be going on in the @s suit?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: switch @D, would be a good play and 2@D by N indicates the same.|pg||
nt|garnetts: This hand has also shown me why the initial 10@C is best--easy to see when all four hands are displayed--but a new combination for me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, me too. Somehow @C10 looks wrong, yet it is right|pg||
nt|andyv:  once you realize how valuable the 6 of @c is, you won't have a problem playing the hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry 2 of @C|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|nt|garnetts: Here discard a heart and play on spades--dummy will be resurrected again later |pg||

nt|ady: what happened to the 10th trick?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well too good for roland this slam altho its less than 50%|pg||
nt|mr murray: should be easy to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades is more tho|pg||
nt|ady: small slam     but needs to beplayed in hearts   |pg||
nt|mr murray: maybe bid 7 if real good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are in 7@S next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And East led @CA!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can make, but it won't|pg||
nt|lestergold: but necause of 4/1 break spades doesnt make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe it does|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this is close to a slam as well|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A club back, rise with the Ace of hearts, King not unblocked and play a club could have seen -1|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Hansen was sure W could not have Kx in @h and still choose to play @s rather than @h|pg||
nt|ady: just 3 club losers in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mike, it can make on the @CA lead it got|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my|pg||
nt|mr murray: I count 13 off the top|pg||
nt|pelu: men en Multi fra Syd kan måske lokke dem |pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: This looks like a pretty straightforward 3NT - plenty of points, but not too many, and a reasonably friendly layout, no matter what line you choose to adopt|pg||
nt|ftpe: er nærmest umulig at melde, de ender nok i 2 sp efter 1 nt åbning|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: 1 club ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 7 spades wow |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it went down at trick 2|pg||
nt|mr murray: club lead doesnt matter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA ruffed, @HA|pg||
nt|ady: thats true   |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C losers only.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: usual philospohy is to play these hands in the big suit but here the 4/4 fit cuts the mustard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it can no longer make|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H = 2 controls, i would imagine|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have risked 2nt as north|pg||
nt|pelu: what now? 4@c or 2@s?|pg||
nt|pelu: tomme tønder buldrer :)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed|pg||
nt|ftpe: 5 diamonds are best contract here|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 5D-3 v 4S. However a couple of jacks to find in 4S|pg||
nt|ftpe: think they will find it|pg||
nt|andyv:  we can say all sorts of clever things but the anguish takes a while to subside.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ftpe: ja:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mr murray: 7 hearts 5 spades and diamond ace|pg||
nt|athene: a pretty boring 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: north should raise the ante high|pg||
nt|pelu: that maded life easy for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D will pose a real problem for e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: over 5@D east can pass (or bid 5@H) and West will gamble on 6@cs|pg||
nt|jron: Ville I doble på Hansens kort efter pas i forhånd fra makker?|pg||
nt|pelu: playing weak jumps 2@S = 9-11 invit|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  very lucky 12 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|ftpe: Rigth Peter, but he just has to find 1 off them|pg||
nt|andyv:  up the line bidders|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h seems to be the destination|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it is difficult. You stick your neck out to bid, and partner ignores you. It is hard not to feel some resentment  |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|benjent: North elected not to look for a major fit. I agree with that approach with his bland 4333.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yup which would be wrong on the hand|pg||
nt|asig: 1@c 16+ or 15 bal|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for NS, but they may bid higher and @DQ lead is a dnger to 6@S by NS.|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d must be xyz|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|benjent: Best line, Jon?|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult, perhaps three hearts to see if that suit breaks, then a club and the dia finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The line in 7@S after @CA lead must be to cash @SA and play another. When spades are 4-1, you need 7 heart tricks and you will get them|pg||
nt|mr murray: this auction gets them nowhere|pg||
nt|pelu: so NS has to go to 6@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Nej|pg||
nt|ftpe: Nej|pg||
nt|ftpe: bilde will 5 di|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe not... it definitely is game forcing:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: men jeg ville heller ikke gå efter game i Nord|pg||
nt|ftpe: Alene i/z og en passet makker|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|benjent: Yes, you really want to play a @c up, then cash @h's, then fall back on @d's, but entries don't permit|pg||
nt|benjent: I think Magnus will win K|pg||
nt|benjent: then play a @c up|pg||
nt|ady: may end up in 4@S    can make  needs a heart lead to hold to 10 tricks  otherwise an elimination and end play will get an overtrick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Me too, but as we see it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after the @HK lead declarer will lose two hearts and the trump|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just experienced a power cut--must be to do with the rain we are having--maybe it was because I was going to say somehting rude lol|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: when hearts come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if it gets tyhem to 6@h which it has it will earn a bushell load of imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 14|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 ned|pg||
nt|ftpe: Nords 4 hj er meget vild, især når makker viser minimum|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  @h's come up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It always rains on bank holidays in England.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: if you get a club lead in 7 spades    right to cash ace and king of hearts   and with the good news will make|pg||
nt|mr murray: they went down in 7 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumn led to winning 14 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumbled into it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how declarer went down, David|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well have punted it for all the info they exchanges|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that dummy was already down to three trumps after the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't enjoy the heart suit if you play it the way you suggest|pg||
nt|lestergold: was natural to play for 3/2 spade break and esnure hearts ame in very unlucky|pg||
nt|mr murray: with heart queen dbltn  7 spades must make|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubole dummy yes but single dummy declarer must weight odds of bad trump break against odds of heart q dropping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once you cash @HA you are down|pg||
nt|roswolf: not convinced leave opps to make the last guess|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I don't like this sort of save auction I'm afraid - I prefer to bid it immediately. East -West now only have one shot at pass/bid/double and may go wrong SOME of the time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: also 10 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: why wrong to bid 6@d - 6@c is cold|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: or heart, ruff, trump ace|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  for @d discard|pg||
nt|pelu: right u are - as usual :)|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  double dummy maybe|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: This way, he at least retains a @d finesse against East as his residual chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice duck by Ragnar|pg||
nt|lestergold: and heart q dropping is less likely |pg||
nt|mr murray: when u find out spades 4-1 u close you draw trumps,close your eyes and your prayers are answered|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible declarer might sneak 11 tricks through, winning this and leading a small spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Second weekend of the cricket season too :(|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: getting two rounds drawn fast and depriving north of her ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: The key is to play a @c to the K, then duck a @c. Later, you can play a @c towards the J. The point is you only get to ruff 2 things in dummy, so you need actual @c tricks to make ...|pg||
nt|benjent: your contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h should be xfer to @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west has a fair bit of defence|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts can be down 1   and 4 spades down 1|pg||
nt|athene: she might not sacrifice|pg||
nt|garnetts: Certainly the right time to out out 1@H if natural lol|pg||
pc|c4|nt|asig: 10 tricks, if declare can untangle the hearts|pg||

pc|c3|nt|roswolf: this will appear precarious|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  will he insist on @s's - I doubt it, and he shouldn't!|pg||
nt|ftpe: in fact best shift|pg||
nt|ftpe: only chance for declarer to go down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|ady: this looks automatic down 1|pg||

nt|andyv:  2N makes no sense by S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: maybe reverses  = F1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mr murray: 500 not a bad result|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbgood: only needs one club trick for the contract now with no trump lead|pg||
nt|ady: when you have long trumps in defence rarely right to lead a shortage rather than your long suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: yup i might have doubled 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was forcing I suppose--but I would pass anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  if I'm holding S hand, I don't care.. I put the pass card out and have my apologies ready|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: east was able to make her bid at the 3 level  so could leave the decision to partner|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: agree    6@D not a great contract      but 3NT could be hazardous on a heart lead    |pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  keep your cards in guys!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even though, in the event, they have done|pg||

nt|athene: but even so, she does have a 7-loser hand|pg||
nt|ady: not much to the play|pg||

nt|andyv:  and now the last hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 4@S a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  South @h7 forced Hansen to a right guess :) (he would probably have made it anyway)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D makes for NS.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: so it was -4 / + 8 if N pass to the X - and +6 if S dont X|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w very aggressive in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mike, David, Johanne and all the specs who joined us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: I must confess, I'm surprised that TWO pairs in the world believe that 1NT was the right bid with that 8-bagger @c suit on board 8|pg||
nt|benjent: Unless they play it as a transfer to @c, in which case, I may still need some convincing it was the right bid :)|pg||
nt|pelu: last board - 1 sektion more to night|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  or 3NT a make for n/s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|garnetts: might be hard to stop out of 6@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts?|pg||
nt|jbgood: still nobody with an 8-bagger ecpects 1 NT to be the final contract!|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 hj begge major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C 4/4.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D the better contract with no clib stop   but clubs are 4-4|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: If 1@D shows hearts, 1@H is a take-out double|pg||
nt|ftpe: han følger nok op med 3 hjerter invit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but the same contract may be reached|pg||
nt|pelu: 10+ and 4 card @h|pg||
nt|pelu: overfor en ut-hånd har jeg ikke begge major, men en @h-farve!|pg||
nt|ftpe: eller 4 hjerter krav :)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3 clubs and 2 each in the rest - diamonds are a mirage|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, take-out of hearts rather, he did not double|pg||
nt|ady: was not automatice for north to take action  and there was no case for south to bid after 2@H opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: This sequence after 2@C is always an issue--it really cramps up the space|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south must be surprised at the 2@D response|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: 18 IMP på udspillet|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: not sure why west should insist on hearts|pg||
nt|friggi: Jón and Þorlákur (Thorlakur) are WC winners so you can expect everything ...|pg||
nt|friggi: as Roland explained earlier they won they cup in 1991|pg||
nt|mr murray: couple of long suit tricks. In n/t may produce nothing although he does have some juicy black 10's|pg||
nt|ady: hearts favourable   so should have no problem|pg||
nt|ady: does not 1NT deny 3 hearts on this sequence?|pg||
nt|ady: diamond best lead|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|mr murray: W can truly never have a reason to play this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@H initially looks best |pg||
nt|garnetts: Then east can bid 2NT |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as has been said before, to get to 6@C someone has to bid clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Giving room to explore |pg||
nt|andyv:  E bid @cs:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: the ladies too high in Bo7 - in 6@h -1|pg||

nt|nielsfoged:  Gregers got 4@d's+2@h's+2@s's+1@c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|benjent: Last week, a (lovely) lady overcalled 1@h natural after we started 1@c-1@d (transfer to @h). Caught us off-guard, really :)|pg||
nt|pelu: kom så Jørgensen!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Does west feel she has done the hand justice ?  5@C is a better contract than 3NT |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: 1@H natural has some merit. Why should she let you talk her out of hearts just because you have shown 5432?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|benjent: Many people would think the South hand is more like a 2@s or 3@s opening than a 1@s opening - even playing a system like precision|pg||

nt|Walddk2: My electricity bill does not change|pg||
nt|benjent: Some places in Australia use, and others don't, so during summer we have 5 time zones|pg||
nt|benjent: Declarer can ruff his 4th @d with the A, then finesse the @c on the way back|pg||
nt|jbgood: ruff the 4th diamond with the club ace is one way to nine tricks|pg||

nt|mr murray: 4 spades = a favorite if not for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: so seniors will go further ahead|pg||

nt|mr murray: may take hook as N has few high cards so should have 1 spade|pg||
nt|ady: if west is guessing the spade    should have drawn trumps immediately and then ducked a diamond   |pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: just board 11   and session has finished|pg||
nt|ady: seniors managed to get to 3NT and make on board 9 in OR   where 4@D went down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W slightly off colour.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree with your earlier comment that the rot set in with 2@d.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S was natural.|pg||
nt|ady: even so east could have had K@C  and Q@D more     west could have made a try with either 4 of either minor to see if a 4@H cu was forthcoming|pg||
nt|rnmalik: where is board 11?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Just see the OR bidding. 2@S-p-4@C-p-4@D-p-4@S.|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looked as if w were trying to steal a slam even if e didn't have a @h control, might be able to get 4 pitches on the minors.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a good bet, but given the state of the match, they needed something.|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the auction e gave him, I'd have been more worried about missing a possible grand than trying to steal 6.|pg||
