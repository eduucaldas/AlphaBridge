nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: penultimate board |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzhm: Tartan 2@h|pg||
nt|djneill: South will probably open 1@c, whatever it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not easy to stay out of 4 @H's (imo) |pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D is multi again |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|djneill: South's 3@h is forcing (North denied 4@h probably by not negative doubling)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S says,  I have a better hand if your suit is hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1991 was the year when Iceland came to a complete standstill. People were up all night to listen to radio coverage of the event. Iceland had their first world champions. Even the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: session in the national parliament (Alþingi) was adjourned to announce the fantastic result in Yokohama. A nation with just 310,000 inhabitants!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure,,,,E might have bid with 7 spades. i think he is considering discarding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ine of the world champions is North at this table|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 to HFV on 10 -- they made 2@H with two overtricks while GT failed by one here.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i believe Iceland has the oldest parliament in Europe. i dont mean the legislators, but the institution|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill: possible promotion here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes,  it was founded in 930 at Þingvellir|pg||

nt|sybarra: great job Steffan,  thx @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to specs for joining us |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you too shirley :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|djneill: it should have been better of course, had N-S found the @d slam - maybe South's choice of 3@h rebid was off the mark - 3@d would have gotten the only real suits in play (@h was ...|pg||
nt|djneill: impossible)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: back in about 1/2 hour per my schedule |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: so everyone played a diamond partial. how odd, considering the number of times that commentators have noted the rarity of partscores in thios event (and country). one might have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that at least one pair would bid 3N with 26HCP & all suits multiple stopped. live & learn|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chick: pretty brave vul X with 12 HCP |pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: suit not good enough for 3H|pg||
nt|djneill: North removes to 2@c to accentuate the distribution, rather than pass and bid 2@c later - does not really want to penalize with such long @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pass not on the menu|pg||
nt|chick: pass looks right to me, after a 11-15 opening, and forcing your side to the 3 level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: canadian spec notes that the first speech ever given in the Icelandic Parliament in 930 is still on record: "How the hell did we miss England by this much??"|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be headed to same 6 @H |pg||

nt|djneill: ok this round is over, Vugraph Schedule at: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/index.php|pg||
nt|djneill: thanks all, please visit www.bridgewithdan.com for some articles on bridge for intermediate players, and my schedule of free lessons|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: personally i think it is Pass on the N hand that would be brave|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as predicted,  just unlucky  |pg||

nt|sybarra: great match,  only one bd out of the "BAM range" |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: you have 6 LTC and support for all suits and a pure hand for offense. if you pass E may raise to 4S on air and there you are cold fior 620 but you have to let them play 4S|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again to all,   |pg||
