nt|bucheister: thank you Nick|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Hi all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nickf: I think there was a score correction from the previous set, still a good lead to the juniors|pg||
nt|nickf: we'll see when the official score is posted on score site http://www.abf.com.au/events/anot/2010/final/anotfin.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bucheister: A very artifical system employed by Klinger and Edgtton; many transfers|pg||
nt|janm: 2@d multi - don't know if they could have anything other than a weak 2M and DBL is almost certainly "pass or correct" - wanting to play 2@sx if opener has spades, but to compete to ...|pg||
nt|janm: 3@h if he has hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: 1D showed hearts and 2S is a heart raise|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably RDBL showed a good hand (he certainly has that :)), and 3@h confirms that DBL was pass or correct, since he wouldn't bid 3@h otherwise. |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|bucheister: Sorry it is not Klinger but Gosney|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|janm: Klinger sensibly decides neither to DBL or bid more at nobody vul - I guess he's seen his partner's weak 2 bids before|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nickf: not a great start for the Howard team in set 2 - I am backing this to make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bucheister: Your are right; I had the wrong hand and player; interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: my fault had players in wrong seats|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: I have always been told not to pass with AK of trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger: "could be a challenge"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: NS will take 3 tricks, either quickly or eventually, for a very flat first board to the set (unless someone foolishly saves in 5@h in the other room)|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Jan|pg||
nt|janm: Hi Nick, thanks for inviting all of us to Australia|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi nick, specs :)|pg||

nt|janm: Hi Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: the "kiddies" are having the better of this final so far|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janm: I was wondering whether Klinger-Mullamphy might use 2@s for a 2-suiter, but apparently this isn't a "weak" hand for them|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|itinerant: Justin Howard is 20 yrs old, Michael Whibley (ex NZ) 22yrs|pg||
nt|janm: That's great!!|pg||
nt|itinerant: In the other room Nabil Edgtton is 18 yrs old this saturday, and Paul Gosney is 24|pg||
nt|itinerant: correction, Paul Gosney is 25 yrs old|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|janm: North has very good holdings in both of West's suits and might decide to try for a penalty here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: It's certainly great to see 4 players who are still eligible to compete in the Juniors doing so well. Will we be seeing them in Philadelphia in October?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|itinerant: the four of them, along with Nabil's older brother Adam (19 yrs) and Andy Hung (22 yrs) are off the world youth Champs in Philidelphia later this year|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: I'd have thought Mullamphy was in a forcing situation here but apparently ot|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mullamphy has probably shown an invitational hand with five spades now|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Roland, hi specs|pg||
nt|nickf: hi Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The question is whether he is worth it opposite 12-14|pg||
nt|itinerant: hi nick :)|pg||

nt|itinerant: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Ed and John|pg||
nt|nickf: Juniors looking shaky already this set|pg||
pc|d3|nt|itinerant: one would suspect a few imps will be coming back Klinger's way when board 15 is scored with the open room|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|bucheister: Many play that a 2D response shows a minimum and denies 3S or 4H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|itinerant: one of australia's top pairs (sartaj hans - tony nunn) play almost NO forcing passes!|pg||

nt|janm: I do have some feeling that if he wasn't going to double 3@h, he shouldn't have doubled 3@d, but maybe that's also hindsight|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: klinger has a plane to catch...SOON|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: this will be fast and furious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: Can NS make 5H here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|itinerant: it will be hard for mullamphy to stay out of game with that shape|pg||
nt|itinerant: especially since his partner is credited with the phrase "six-five, come alive!"|pg||
nt|nickf: that's what a reputation does to you|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem that the diamond losers can be held to 1|pg||
nt|janm: Wonder what methods Mullamphy has available here - must have had something other than 2@s or the 2@s would have been a little more prompt|pg||
nt|itinerant: if there's a gadget for it, Ron and Matt probably use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: EW don't really have enough to push them, especially since they don't know about the club fit|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|itinerant: tell me, Jan, would you use 2NT in Mullamphy's seat as natural?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bucheister: 2nt id probably good/bad 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West bid 4@D?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: OK|pg||
nt|itinerant: now he's shown a bad hand with diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: this looks like 690|pg||
nt|janm: This DBL is a little pushy - surely he didn't have anything in reserve for his 1@s bid vul vs not|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: I think this is an auction that screams for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's like  1@S  1NT  ;  2@D   pass|pg||
nt|itinerant: likely that dummy will be ruffing hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: edgtton asking about 'attitude leads'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bucheister: strongly agee; diamond lead|pg||
nt|itinerant: just in time to take the contract -1|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|itinerant: oops|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|itinerant: 4C, fit-showing, from East might have led to a better result for EW but it's hard to say the E hand is worth it|pg||
nt|janm: No, I think 2NT should be some sort of raise, as is 2@s and perhaps also the 4m bids|pg||
nt|itinerant: The @sQJ look like tram tickets on defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and signals|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Sandra Landy of England had a Bols Tip in the 80's. Whenever the auction suggests a trump lead, you should lead one regardless of your holding, even from Kx. The trick will come ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back with interest |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|c8|nt|itinerant: mullamphy recognised the trump control issue and witheld from ruffing a second heart - the only play to make after the diamond duck was, in fact, hearts 33|pg||
nt|janm: I thought that showing 3 spades and some values was about all E was worth - with only 3 spades, he can't really want to force to the 4 level can he?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and discards|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|itinerant: klinger doing a good job of stripping this hand|pg||

mb|2N|nt|vugrapha1: claim was made on the 4th trick after winning first two and losing the 3rd|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|hoffers: An opportunity for the Klinger team to bid the grand|pg||

nt|hoffers: Only problem for Kanetkar "Has Brown upgraded"!!|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|itinerant: though he took whibley's double at it's word and played him for the other diamond honour|pg||
mb|3S!|an|minors|nt|janm: He was concerned (rightly of course) with making sure he didn't go down, must have seen some danger we missed|pg||
nt|janm: It must have been hard to believe that Whibley doubled on what he had|pg||
nt|itinerant: i think he was just looking for KQx of diamonds in the West hand after the double... and fair enough too|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: You're surely right|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|itinerant: heading for 3nt|pg||
nt|itinerant: not an easy contract with these breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Now there's a 1@s overcall - with Klinger's hand you might DBL if the opponents got to the 4-level :)|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|bucheister: interesting bid|pg||
nt|itinerant: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|an|exclusion|nt|itinerant: good decision from Whibley|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: ... makes up for the last hand|pg||
mb|6D|nt|itinerant: given 3C was forcing, Mull' could be certain he would get a chance to double at a higher level.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|itinerant: there's an inference here for declarer: Mullamphy must  have diamonds also|pg||

nt|itinerant: perhaps|pg||
nt|itinerant: ok, so he did draw th elast trump, but lightening quick so it escaped the vugraph operator|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|itinerant: a common agreement is that double of a freely bid 3NT by the player sitting over the dummy would ask for dummy's 1st bid suit - that might have been a more profitable punt from ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: North on the previous hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|janm: 2@d alerted, which sounds as if 2@c was Puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: yeah, they play a variation of Keri|pg||
nt|itinerant: 5 card major stayman, in other words|pg||
nt|janm: Some play that 2@d in response to Puppet Stayman shows no 4 or 5 card Major, apparently they just deny 5, but that was all Klinger cared about|pg||

nt|itinerant: new players sometimes hear that it's right with this club suit to cash the A or K first, in case of stiff Q offside|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: With plenty of tricks in the side suit, the 5-1 trump break won't bother him|pg||
pc|h2|nt|itinerant: but taking a first round finesse will collect Qxxx onside, 4 times as likely as stiff Q offside!|pg||

nt|janm: I think it would be 4 times as likely if there were only 5 missing clubs - it's even more here with 6 - there is only 1 stiff Q, but 10 small doubletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: note that if you had 3 clubs opposite the AKJTx you could catch a stiff queen and Qxxx by cashing the A or king first|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: excellent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H the key call|pg||
nt|itinerant: difficult for mullamphy to pass with this moster but he's shown his values already|pg||
nt|itinerant: interesting that klinger didn't go for the blood by passing - even at this vul - i guess he didn't llike his pips|pg||
