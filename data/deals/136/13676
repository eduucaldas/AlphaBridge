nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Cold slam, now they only need to bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The key is Ragnar's singleton heart|pg||
mb|2C|nt|friggi: why not 3D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ady: 5@D a make    also 3NT without a heart and could still make with a heart lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|benjent: NS have the red suit fits to get in the way, but they missed their best chance to get involved when North couldn't open|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|friggi: jon will big  NT|pg||
nt|friggi: 3|pg||
nt|friggi: ok done|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my table the auction would start P-1@c-P-1@s|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract, which might have some issues|pg||
nt|henryb:  a normal contract on 23 high cards?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no particular fit?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|benjent: Delicate 5Nt by Aron.|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: and a good source of tricks in clubs |pg||
nt|santyclz: Reasonably so, s's @cs are worth a bit more than their hcp value.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|benjent: Allows for Ragnar to have 2 keycards, and gives them a chance to back into the grand slam|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|friggi: why not 12|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is interesting. Looking at the N-S cards I would either like to be in 3NT or 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, it appears to be quite a complicated hand|pg||
nt|xenya: you have to make your choice, Henry |pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  Well, 3N appears to depend on finding a lot of cards onside|pg||

pc|sK|nt|xenya: agreed|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  not just one or two|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had to give up on @cs when w showed out and run the @dq to e.  I don't see why he should have chosen that line though.|pg||
nt|henryb:  so I would rather stop in 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: but giving up on  a vulnerable game...|pg||
nt|henryb:  When 3N is going two down the odds are less favorable|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This was a 1@S opening to Bilde at the other table|pg||

nt|mdgraham: indeed :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Too strong for some: 6-loser hand, or count Zar points (if you can:))|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: we saw a flat 16-count opened with a 12-14 1NT about 30 minutes ago   |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: By a senior? Forgotten how to count?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they missed a good slam which went off because of a 5-0 break |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, the Swedish juniors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah, have not learned to count yet :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was also a 5% slam which amde - Roland would have been proud |pg||
nt|cuttysark: He must be their coach|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: it needed 3-2 diamonds with the queen onside, @CA onside, and 3-3 spades|pg||

nt|ady: this is last hand       thx all   enjoyable|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: well you always have 4 clubs and 3 aces (at worst) -- that's 7 tricks -- but there are chances for more: Q10x in hearts or @D finesse, and QJx in spades...  |pg||
mb|2N|nt|friggi: so what partscore are we missing here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  but lots of ways for the opponents to take 5 tricks before you have 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Intermediate jump overcall, not such a bad idea, especially opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|3C|nt|benjent: 4@h is cold for NS. EW have some potential with their sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and getting to the long clubs may be problematical|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: I am not in love with 5@C I must say|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That hand is too flat, and at love all ...     I would not|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: yes, it's far from 100% -- got to get a few things right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  I guess on this hand if you aren't going to open 2@s, which seems normal unless that means something different|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s is better than pass|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: "@C checkback?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  at my table the auction would go 2@s-P-4@s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|friggi: think so|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: 4@h makes on the spade guess - not a sure thing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: We saw a gutsy (ie looked wrong) 5@h sac from Ragnar on 2 ... Aron just returning the favour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And when partner has shown intermediate strength there is some hope that we will defeat 4@S with the cards East has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He knows that 5@C can't make|pg||
nt|benjent: @d, @d ruff wasn't actually NS's best defence, although it locks up 1 off. |pg||
nt|santyclz: I think we're getting old, Henry.  It sure looks like a weak 2 to me too.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: Ragnar was a long way from solving the @d suit all by himself|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|Vugraph814: 2@c = majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C = majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: useful convention here: 2@C shows both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You just pretend that West opened 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraph814: and 2@c just earned some imps for the Open team|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Should also be used after a 1@C opening|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The only nation with a 100% record: ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: qualified once and won it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: World Champions in 1991 were: Guðmundur Páll Arnarson, Örn Arnþórsson, Jón Baldursson, Guðlaugur Jóhannsson, Þorlákur Jónsson and Aðalsteinn Jörgensen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So we have two of them at this table, and one in the other room|pg||

nt|cuttysark: That is a lot - I take it he threw a few in|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: but Thomas was very tired when they finished yesterday|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They should play that many board to realise how they feel when they are tired and under pressure|pg||

nt|mr murray: might easily take proper club position|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad caps lock|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: If EW DON'T lead a @h, you can make 12 tricks thanks to the stiff @cQ, but a @h lead kills communication|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Player names are all first names as you may have guessed. Surnames are not used much in Iceland. You can see them in the profiles, though|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|ady: East would make 6@H opposite all three hands|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjent: Well, well. Always good to go wrong with your opening prediction as a commentator :) Gets the confidence going |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  which would get me to two diamonds, two spades two clubs and a heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: prefers to draw the lurkers for some reason|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: All (99.9%) of male Icelanders have -son at the end of their surname, the women -dóttir, but there are exceptions|pg||
nt|benjent: I'd say nice stop except slam is actually a good contract :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|jron: The EW pair isn´t really famous in Denmark for their systemic agreements - at least not if  we discuss those where they agree :?|pg||
