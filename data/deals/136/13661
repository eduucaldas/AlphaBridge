mb|p|nt|peachy: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  current standings|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: so a X'd hand to start us off, maybe will be an exciting set of hands :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: North does have supermax for his 1D opening, perhaps just took a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Staffan |pg||

nt|marlowepi: when N bid 3S he said: "i am worth an invite in spades", the rest is up to you. W bid strongly and EW are not vul, so they dont rate to go down more than one. S was not vul either ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so with spades might have taken some liberties. if N thought his hand was this good, maybe he should have double 2S|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: all of these players  are pretty aggressive in bidding, successful too|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think N bid reasonably.  Took a chance and saw that it had paid off, so extracted the max.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: 12-14 nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi Yuval|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: A bit risky, that 4@H contract had potential to make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i like the idea of sending that message, but maybe the message that will actually be perceived i: "i will bid whatever i want whenever i want without regard to partner, so dont ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: there is no contract more perfect than a game making through luck opr misdefense|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C was either 16+ any or 11-13 with 6+@H. 2@D showed accept if p had 16+, 2@S showed exactly 3@S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|andyv:  at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice lead by N, but it won't be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This one "Rolands" in.  |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: certainly a safe place to be |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: This one needs the misdef factor, but they arent getting it, spade lead prob coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: no system card, but it appears East opened a swedish/polish/strong @c, and now West has enough to act (not sure why didn't act over 1@s)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make S play the trump suit  from the top |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: nowadays many players tend to lead a major after the 1NT-3NT sequence, sometimes even with 5 cards minor suit in their hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|chick: it has the luck factor, the @CA in the right place|pg||
nt|peachy: actually, there is a line to make and surely Oddur will find it (duck)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|djneill: South can see the @d on the board and will find the @c switch after winning a @h|pg||
pc|d7|nt|friggi: W and E are brothers and they know each other very well|pg||
nt|friggi: so it could make!?|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR on Bd 1, 4@H was played undoubled by E.  Down one, so 6 to HFV.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must be missing something. isnt it trivial to make 3N here?|pg||
nt|friggi: it is|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, club ace right. Even diamonds all in the S|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||

nt|mr murray: must know the hearts are 3-3|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: Defence got a chance here, but not so easy to see. |pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: diamonds offer nothing good. if N has a D honor he would clear spades and then cash them. if S has KQ then u need club ace onside after all|pg||

mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: it was suggested that W should play diamonds instead of clubs. i am explaining why clubs is much better|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Bd 2, where N/S here failed in 4@S by one, their counterparts in the OR played 2@S making with an overtrick.  So the 6 go right back to GT and we're tied.|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder if 2@C is Gazilli|pg||
nt|friggi: I think it is a Q|pg||
nt|peachy: other competitors played some sort of relay 2C, so might well be|pg||
nt|chick: or a similar artificial bid showing 15+|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: is gazzilli played in this seq not only after 1@h - 1@s and 1M - 1nt?|pg||

nt|djneill: the @d lead was reasonable, even if led something else, the @d switch would be hard to avoid - the dummy was so weak in @d it seems unlikely West would have both the @dA and @dQ ...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|chick: ok which is more likely ....  @HQxx offside, or 5-0 spade split?  |pg||

nt|djneill: South has just 10 HCP, but two interesting trick sources - a 4-4 @s fit, or else the long @d, worth an invite if 12-14|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the 4-1 spade break beats 7H also unless a club is led i think|pg||

nt|peachy: he will have no way to enjoy the H now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i thnk he should have played ace of spades and a spade to hand. if they are 4-1, he needs the whole heart suit. if they weer 32, he can ruff up the hearts|pg||

pc|dK|nt|djneill: East should probably double rather than bid 2@d, in my eyes|pg||

nt|sybarra: not my favorite pattern for 1 nt,   (5422)  but another rebid problem with out it |pg||

pc|s4|nt|djneill: North has 2@d, 1@h, 1@c losers, so needs to play the @c for just 1 loser to make this - one thing that helps is that E-W might break @c or @h after cashing the 2nd @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr:      |pg||
nt|djneill: 4@d, 4@c, 2 Aces at least, all South has to do is hold up a few spades to cut communication between the E-W hands, so might just make 9 tricks |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzhm: 2@h is 11-15 1@h is 9-14|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: given the auction likely to play spades  |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: ah, thanks, Johann :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: strange to hve so much overlap in the ranges|pg||
nt|jcwla: Christmas has come early.|pg||
nt|chick: probably includes a length factor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and to open 2H with a 4 loser hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: also does not need club lead, just a club up from dummy (sorry) |pg||
nt|mr murray: what a nice place to play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: the benefit is getting yo lnow H quality|pg||
nt|friggi: but weak nt will expl|pg||
nt|peachy: to know|pg||
nt|mr murray: not easy to stop at 2 hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction may have died to fast for S... until dummy comes down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: chacun a son gout|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|yuval10: if N doesn't open then it's probably goes P  P  2@h X  P 2@s all pass|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange shift. low heart seems to stand out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or possibility ace then nine|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not such a fan of this raise opposite a real hand.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors hard to see the upside of the 3H call|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opposite any hand|pg||
nt|peachy: these guys have no fear!|pg||

pc|d5|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|kit: did he really hook?  That will cost a ton of tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Surprising that North didn´t go on and ask for the Queen of @H, since that would be what you need for 7NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  with this vul, I think S would have opened 3@h|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: yes, no more entry to spade tricks or to diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think a misunderstanding for NS. |pg||
nt|mr murray: 7 card suit. 90% open at 3 level|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually can just play a @H ot the ace and back again that works also |pg||
pc|hA|pc|s6|pc|c6|nt|yuval10: yeah probably so, then it makes things more complicated, will W risk a X then?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|djneill: standard scandinavian style is 2N is a limit or better raise, and South has accepted|pg||
nt|djneill: North*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: nope, all natural bids|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|djneill: ok brd 19 was a pickup as expected for N-S, +400 in 4@h down 4, but imagine if doubled...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should keep W quiet|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

nt|djneill: brd 21, the strong NT preempted the opponents, and since weak NT is the range for this N-S, that was a random swing|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: 13 to HFV on 9 - GT failed by 1 in 4@C there and went for 800 here.|pg||
nt|mr murray: never quiet|pg||

nt|mr murray: up to 140 now|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: short of entries to hand, may play club honor'|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cute spade spots|pg||
nt|djneill: likely this is just a strong @c, since most Polish/Swedish would not be able to respond 2@c opposite a possible 11 HCP otherwise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: necessary if N had AQT of Ds|pg||
nt|djneill: so, 2@c game force 5+@c, 2@h 5+@h, 3@h fit, East cue-bids to be courteous, as does West, and both realize they are both minimum after 4@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  actually was up to 170|pg||
nt|mr murray: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: and this is a winning position also|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|djneill: East's 4@c bypassed 3@s, so East does not have a @s control - so when West cue-bids 4@d, that implies no worry about 2 fast @s losers|pg||
mc|12|nt|yuval10: if he played @s, yes...but he must've been affraid of a ruff|pg||
