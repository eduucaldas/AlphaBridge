mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|weak 5-9 6+!H/!S|nt|hedyg: 2@d= weak in a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2NT enquiry, 3@D very weak with spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: EW can make 5@d with a good view in @c, practically impossible|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: EW close to game in a red suit - dropping @CQ would help - but no real chance to get into the bidding|pg||
mc|7|nt|Vugraphztf: He asked: who's got the @DA? and claimed|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes as specs point out too 4@H is cold|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all, welcome back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ciao a tutti, bienvenuti|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Francesco ANGELINI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=10073|pg||
nt|daman: All of these players have names that would look good on a bottle of Italian wine|pg||
nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|daman: the systems are skewed at times so we will have to guess on occasion|pg||
nt|daman: so    if NS play a weak NT   that's what they will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: tah dH|pg||
nt|daman: dah|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/incontri.asp?tipo=5  for results and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lavazza way ahead of the field at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|flash: 16-board matches|pg||
mb|1S|nt|flash: probably in range for 1NT??   (all help welcome with systems  :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
nt|daman: obviously not a transfer|pg||
nt|flash: nope - 1@C it is|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H a likely spot here.|pg||
nt|daman: South will continue to compete over 2@H|pg||
nt|flash: with that hand, Duboin might well have been in the auction, irrespective of the opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Hi all|pg||
nt|flash: evening and welcome|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably will finish here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: or is it kalispera in Greek?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: HELLO EVERYONE|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The match of today is like a KO, because in this last round both are first at same points (165)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Classification: LAVAZZA 165, ANGELINI 165, PAUNCZ(Florence) 129, SABBATINI(Rome) 118|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The level is very high: Versace-Lauria & Fantoni-Nunes are 4 member of italian team for world champion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: In US it would go 1@H, banana, banana, 3@H, swish.|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam woyuld be too much of an adventire|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a little danger now|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Kalispera|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Also Duboin-Sementa (LAVAZZA) and Bocchi(LAVAZZA) play in italian team|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Bocchi today play with one of the stroger young player in the world (Agustin Madala - argentina) |pg||
nt|roswolf: west would have an easy t/o dbl if south hadnt called 3@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The formation i think will be:|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: West luckily has an out|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that 2NT was a game try of some ilk|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ANGELINI: Versace-Lauria & Fantoni-Nunes   LAVAZZA:Duboin-Sementa & Bocchi-Madala|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Lorenzo LAURIA http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4849 top 5 ranking in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|roswolf: safe enough|pg||
nt|bridge_one: So we will see to play 7 world champion at the tables !|pg||
nt|roswolf: YES GOOD QUALITY|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am looking forward to this|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: Hi guys gl, Sergio BIANCHI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=6328 and Ezio FORNACIARI http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3599|pg||

pc|d8|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|flash: and that 3@D and 3@H show values in the suit bid|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes im up to it i thnk, only problem would be if they do something which conflicts time wis|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it won't be a big surprise for me to watch aggsressive bidding & carding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
nt|fskoul:  For sure, but I think Sementa will just bid 3@S now. 4 would be too much with a bare King and 3 small trumps only|pg||
nt|fskoul:  No|pg||
nt|flash: but the lack of a 2nd dummy entry makes this too high|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: e/e have an easy partscore in @D and i think a good start for lavazza|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fskoul:  For a NV game it asks quite a lot of things|pg||
nt|flash: the strain of Commentator's Curse, currently making the rounds, is particularly virulent  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Geoff and Roland 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W make easy 3@D or more, so 3@s would be a decent result|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|an|FG 5+!d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Fantunes did their best in CR to disrupt the bidding here|pg||

mb|3N|an|5!h 5!c min with hcp in the short suits|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Nunes found a 1@S overcall in the other room - don't think it would occur to me :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: their 1 level nv overcalls can be light :p|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: As we see|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: So the contract is played the other way up here, but it is still unbeatable|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: Versace and Lauria are proud about this bid :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting 3NT, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT= 5@H+5@c with hcps in the short suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphztf: they say this bid happens once in 15 years|pg||

nt|daman: maybe he dropped the @D Jack|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Luigi REIFF http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=20864|pg||
nt|athene: very boring 4@H+1 here|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4@H just making|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2A+tr K|pg||
nt|daman: ca make a grand slam in @Hs if they bid it|pg||
nt|daman: can*|pg||
nt|jtr: Has he moved back to Italy?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 82 I am told|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ANGELINI TEAM: LAURIA ANGELINI, VERSACE GIUBILO, FANTONI NUNES|pg||
nt|fskoul:  I don't think Giorgino ruffed the 4th diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he endplayed West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that I know of|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he is regarded as a native Italian as far as bridge in Italy is concerned|pg||
nt|jtr: ok ty|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: see 1@s with 8HCP|pg||
nt|daman: if my Mom had the North hand   we would be in 6@Ds|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: remember FantoniNunes play a aggressive bridge, open with 9/12 hcp at level 2 with 5+cards in a suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: Il buon giorno si vede dal mattino (the good day can be seen from the morning)  1 supposedly good for NS pair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N normal contract, not much words needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||
nt|athene: Lauria-Versace play a relatively (for this level) natural system|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a straightforward game hand - 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|athene: ok, less boring now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: North is going to drive them to some slam|pg||
nt|daman: guaranteed|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 2NT with the South hand|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
nt|jtr: Polish type @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The super-accept was needed, to prompt South into being interested in a slam on that moderate hand (on the last board).|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C is  blueteam style (generic forcing)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w bidding on tram tickets|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or is rubinsool|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: welcome aboard buddy|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S   is not on my radar|pg||
nt|bridge_one: D'AVOSSA INTONTI are new players, strong - Intonti is from Rome, D'Avossa played also in Lavazza team for many years|pg||
nt|athene: NS tend to just bid their suits in general|pg||
nt|athene: they do bid them at a higher level than many people, of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|jtr: Why 1@d then?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D was some bid on this collection|pg||
nt|athene: but then they make more tricks than most people|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play 2/1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D a semi-psyche if you like. He is NV vs V|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: age hasnt dulled his bridge awareness|pg||
nt|jtr: This is rather horrid for declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: He will think the @dK is offside|pg||
nt|roswolf: might try to use the hearts via a double finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||
nt|flash: the agreement to use 2@C as natural over a possibly natural 1@C opener is quite rare|pg||
nt|fskoul:  4@H is a makeable contract|pg||
nt|flash: this can be beaten, given the position in the trump suit|pg||
nt|fskoul:  true, but the @D lead is far from ovious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c not alerted, so i think generic forcing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|flash: i'm reminded that Ghestem is likely to be in use, leaving 2@C as natural here  :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i amn't sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i know bocchiDuboin play rubinsool (undersuit after overcall)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: however a double edge sword|pg||
nt|daman: he will take hois 10 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: of course north felt there was too much danger his side was getting stolen from|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|daman: that's the sound on BBO when you claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a push for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Win @cA and a low @d looks sensible|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: both slams make but diamonds safer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|daman: I guess he could bid 5@H asking for a @C control|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike  and thanks for joining|pg||
nt|daman: or Blackwood|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike, good to see you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening from rainy London|pg||
nt|daman: what should he do if he bids 4NT and partner shows 2 with the Queen?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: lauria passes, not because he is sure of beating, but just because -590 might be the best score available on the hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: ah   my other option   asks for a @C control|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: now   South should bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|henryb:  gm|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: They are tecnically very good - so Angelini choose to play with best formation LAURIA VERSACE|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
nt|flash: now the @D shift may be all that's left?  but, no...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Now it will all depend on D' Avossa finding his way with the @C suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: the cards lie well for declarer in any event|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: Not what North had in mind |pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: something went wron|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|daman: the dreaded fake reverse by North got them in hot water|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: not once did North show @H support|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: and the got away with it     a @S lead would have been embarrassing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you wonder if 1@H-2@D-2@h-3@D is forcing |pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of high small cards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: I guess N was a good hand for Fit Jump if such on card|pg||
nt|flash: for North American players, Ghestem is a series of calls to show specific 2-suited holdings|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: Declarer surprised by that @dJ:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To my mind, Benito Garozzo is the greatest player the world has ever seen. It's unlikely that that the future will produce another player as perfect as he was, and to a large ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: extent still is. In many respects. What a treat it is to watch the legend in action|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: east needs to cash|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: The @S9 back tells North that he should hold up the @SA to preserve communications.|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty Francesca|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: Bocchi bid 2@c as N to fix the gameforce|pg||

pc|s2|mc|10|nt|hedyg: in this match every imp may make all the difference|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SK8HDAKQT874C8762,SJ742HT87D652CKQJ,S965HAK63DJ9CA954,SAQT3HQJ9542D3CT3|sv|e|nt|athene: if west had redoubled, then NS have more of a problem|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Are we safe at this level giving pd 7 or so?" - no.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, ypu suspect Fantoni-Nunes will find 6@D or 6@H at the other table |pg||
nt|jtr: And may still be when you finish:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: interesting slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sabbatini team is in 3th position - probably the more strong formation after ANGELINI and LAVAZZA|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but JTxx sets|pg||
nt|daman: well    they have other issues as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, got out cheaply for 5.|pg||
nt|peachy: both pairs play weak NT, apparently. Haven't located a conv card though|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The club suit lies luckily for E/W, so 5+5+1+1 is possible for them in spades.|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W have 12 tricks in @s with the fortunate @c position, but it is not possible to bid it|pg||
nt|flash: 5 IMPs to Sabbatini on Board 17 - the optimistic game was avoided|pg||
nt|fskoul:  If D'Avossa believed the early play, he could see that East had shown 4 @S and 3@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: @S Ace    @C Queen|pg||
nt|daman: undo|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and the 2 of @D return could guide him to the conclusion that @C are 3-3|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: or does that really show the majors lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weak nt (10-12) in action - fave vuln|pg||
nt|jtr: Tempted by 3@c maybe?|pg||
nt|henryb:  in my opinion|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C precision style|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may have its moments|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h with six cards better that Dbl to give both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with Fantoni|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H from West to show a great spade fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Nelle botti piccine ci sta il vino buono, well good things come in small packages|pg||
nt|athene: now we find out if NS know their methods :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is Drury|pg||
nt|jtr: North i mean|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 just on the @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, South beat him to it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H from South performed the useful function of preventing west bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S forcing, so 4@H need|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sorry. I am in the wrong room. Must depart for elsewhere.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Bye David !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Lauria will pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he don't know (having void in @S) the reason of 4@H by Versace|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm normally yes but on this hand the spade fit may be lost|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: 3@D free means very good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: X is very likely a support double, showing 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria make this decision frequently . normally he guess !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a error |pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 5@D are ON in this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bids a firm 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala is terrible in the cards play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in the auction is youg and aggressive|pg||
nt|bridge_one: young|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will know of wasted heart values and will not enquire re slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala is thinking because initial 2@C by Bocchi can give a slam with right cards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: welcome to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, either the double was penalties, in which case north should pass, or it wasn't, in which case lauria shouldn't double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C shows shortage i assume|pg||
nt|flash: i'd've thought that Sementa wouldn't sit for 2@C; he won't sit for 2@CX|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is a good option, giving void|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been impressed by madala's cardplay - and he wouldnt be on the italian team if he was that poor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with sgl he can't bid so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: AK@H are the worts cards to play slam ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: terrible means very good !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: like a devil :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so better terrific|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that got lost in the translation - i am pleased to agree with you giorio|pg||
mb|5D|nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S from West I assume...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: North has a normal diamond lead, IMO|pg||
nt|flash: XX for SOS|pg||
nt|harmon: I though Sabbatini was playing in quail hollow golf tourney:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Mike and Hamdi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Cornelia, welcome|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont know what 3NT means other than it isnt natural:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has supported hearts already and is effectively cuebidding|pg||
nt|jtr: It seems 300 specs have an idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt be suprised by a 6@H punt now |pg||
nt|jtr: @s value makes sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: giorgio|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: Hi Daniela|pg||
nt|daman: a very intelligent auction|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Norberto Bocchi interview at http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/2010%e2%80%99s-europeans-norberto-bocchi-talks-about.html|pg||
nt|daman: longest suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4Nt is to play ? i think so, but this kind of agrements arn't easy ...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Looks like the redouble has announced "it's our hand" -- inviting subsequent X's as penalty.  Overruling looks unilateral as pd could have passed unless sure.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for your suggestions sorry i cannt type out thanks 300 times|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin bypasses 2@D, since that was South's opening call|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: smolen + sys on over X -> which could be easier to describe|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this by playing on hearts?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so Bocchi (great player of ALL games) chooce 5@D (more sure to understand)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
nt|fskoul:  No double no trouble, as they say. |pg||
nt|flash: we've seen already that South is a 'thoughtful' player; here, he really has nowhere to go|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: then they defeat the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: hook to !j, the queastion is which direction|pg||
nt|athene: heart to the @H10 now will work but he has no reason to play east for the @HJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: no - science is being used|pg||
pc|c6|nt|po-s: winning bridge...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H was 2 down, so 5@S is correct|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@s is potentially three down|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps North, holding Kxx of @Ss was supposed to X this??|pg||
nt|flash: the defense for down 2 is virtually impossible - low @C now for a @H shift|pg||
nt|fskoul:  These 3 card double are always difficult in teams|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: guessed well|pg||
nt|daman: now  it will make10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @d ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if you assume diamonds are 5-2, vacant places suggests the heart finesse the other way?|pg||
nt|daman: fortune favors the bold|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: if the hand was all about the club suit, this is a position where south should play the @CK first round if east leads low|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: !4 ? :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: @h4..lol|pg||
nt|athene: but there are transportation issues|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still hard work, @s guess in next row|pg||
pc|d7|nt|flash: low @D for partner to ruff, suggesting a @C return|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|c7|nt|athene: the double locates the @SA|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@h I mean|pg||
nt|athene: then east has the option of playing for singleton @CK, and finesse the @C9 to pick up north's @C10xx|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the choice isn't easy for Madala - with @c 3/3 batter discard 2@s over AK@H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: now N will be lucky because the long diamonds with the long trumps|pg||
nt|athene: @C10xxx|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin pitches a @H on this and gets out for down 1|pg||
nt|fskoul:  this is premature, since Duboin can discard his @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @c 3/2|pg||
mc|11|nt|bridge_one: the choise of Madala is to play for A@S in East (after the overcall)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|daman: a slam on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now a pedestrian 3NT or 4@S for NS|pg||

nt|daman: I wonder if they can get there after the opening bid|pg||
nt|daman: North should at least make a try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N can easy dictate|pg||
nt|daman: maybe South should have bid 2@D and then 4@S    unless that shows a different hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3A, 2K should not be hard to visualize|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d really nice|pg||

nt|h_karluk:  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt natural strong balanced|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c is balanced medium force (possible also majors if it is mine convention:)|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i guess north would read well and pull|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl at 2@D si to give the lead in NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdl definitively 18/19 balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would pass - south should remember the e/w bidding on rubbbish a couple of hands ago|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so Madala is thinking to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks in @D for N/S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10|pg||
nt|roswolf: enough|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: South will probably win the king and switch to a low heart|pg||
nt|athene: It's becoming increasingly popular to play 2nt - 3red - 3major shows support|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: both vul, any attempt by NS pair could be dicey|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nasty guess|pg||
nt|peachy: North chose to show his 15-17.  |pg||
nt|daman: I would too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@H are ON, but not easy to call|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: ssh off record - play the King :-p|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 2@H what I would want my opps to do with N.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Is South related to Benito Bianchi, Blue Team regular in the 1970's? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Garozzo is East at the othe table |pg||
nt|chick: he's still not home, with every finesse off, should go down at least 2|pg||
nt|fskoul:  I believe 1NT has some "not natural" meaning, implying @H fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: weaker players (such as myself on occasion) would hasten to support|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h transfer, 3N apparently denying three card spade support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@d and 4@H cue bid|pg||
nt|athene: The idea is you just give up on being able to stop in 3 of a major when opener has only a doubleton|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa might've committed a Law-of-Total-Tricks raise to 3@H; it's surprising to see Duboin do it?|pg||
nt|flash: that would certainly fit with the auction, Fotis|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@d is xfert for @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: not sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S i think a proposal|pg||
nt|athene: it makes game and slam auctions much easier|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, probably they use different gadgets (like 4@S immediatly over 4@C) - so 4@S probably cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is wrong, because of responder has, say, @sJ10xxx and a yarborough otherwise, 3@s will usually be a better contract that 2N|pg||
nt|drewsky: EW are the ten of @C away from being a decent slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 3N will be dreadful|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt depending on agreement is turbo or rkbw @C|pg||
nt|athene: yes, certainly it doesn't work when responder is very weak, but playing imps especially, people are prepared to give up on that to bid the strong hands better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: turbo is out, but many pair use turbo with @C suit|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea was first popularised in france?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: welcome Henry Bethe |pg||
nt|henryb:  I know this may be supposed to be Italian commentary, but would you prefer English to none?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will speak english for now (since my italian is horrible) |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at bidding not sure what 2 @D was |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H was definitely a bit wet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about that....North might have shown some semblace of spade support at some stage|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|jtr: The lead was helpful but he would have made the hand anyway|pg||
nt|flash: several reasonable lines to get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm south i think made a wrong decision but clearly didnt want to risk a big minus swing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: reason : if underlead by Q just shake his hand, opening leader didn't, then that's most probably a try to subterfuge for you|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  I will have to figure out the bidding along with the rest of you.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know they have special system but ..... |pg||
nt|henryb:  I understand 1@d-1@s. beyond that I have no idea|pg||
nt|daman: I would play on @Ds|pg||
nt|flash: the location of the @SJ is favorable for declarer|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: especially when opps are in the middle of an artificial sequence (i assume 1@D was some sort of relay)|pg||
nt|athene: you can really give them problems if you pre-empt before they actually get around to bidding their suits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam there|pg||
nt|drewsky: It is useful to firm agreements after 4@C, for example, my partner and I play 4@D agrees clubs and 4@H agrees spades, etc|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  You lose a lot of imps by getting overboard on partscore hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Drew, it is usefull to have the agreements in this sequence|pg||
nt|athene: I am not sure exactly how good 6@C is here - you don't mind stopping out of it, certainly|pg||
nt|henryb:  Too good for Roland who likes slams around 12%, but otherwise pretty bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was more easy to make, but in bridge need to use the bid to know the possibility to play a slam, so 5@C i think is a right contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in theory that was west's fault|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@H was made ruffing 3@S in the hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: I would suspect it is around the 50% mark|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: If the @SK is on you will generally make and if it isn't you generally won't|pg||
nt|bridge_one: INTONTI is precise in cards playing|pg||
nt|henryb:  that is much too high. you need a favorable spade lie and not two club losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so probably his line will be the best|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|daman: sooner or later he is going to have to play @Hs|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: I can even understand 2 @C,  but startin at 2 @D I am lost |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as we surmised, Fantone-Nunes found 6@D on board 2.|pg||
nt|daman: yes     to lose 2 :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  cash three rounds of @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is agustin madala from argentina |pg||
nt|henryb:  and exit with the @sJ|pg||

pc|c5|nt|sybarra: (orginially)   |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: is there another option other than playing a @H?      |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sybarra: bridge pro might last longer |pg||
nt|sybarra: less injuries |pg||
nt|athene: but as a practical measure, when you have that east hand and partner opens, and opps are bidding hearts, you are asking an awful lot of partner if you get cute with control bids|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Jim|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|daman: both pairs play weak NT|pg||
nt|olson: 2s  1h  4d  3c|pg||
nt|flash: Angelini out to an early lead and has passed Lavazza for 1st place|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: there is a case for responding 2@C on hands like this South|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaahhhhh|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think a operator error|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Olson|pg||
nt|athene: rather than the "obvious" 1@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play a natural bridge with many (a lot!) of conventions|pg||
nt|flash: the last match of the championships will be tomorrow - far too early for some of us   :(|pg||
nt|fskoul:  not all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: really?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 13+ forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|daman: 1NT = 18-19|pg||
nt|athene: much better just to bid slam, or blackwood, or something that makes west's life a bit easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we talking about a hand only 4 losers after west opened?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Forcing pd to bypass 5@S to either control bid at 6 level or blast slam -- I'm with you, it was time to get realistic..|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what's the problem finding slam ?|pg||
nt|athene: yes and the small doubletons weren't even in opps' suit, which might give you some pause|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D  majors|pg||
nt|jtr: Should be able to avoid the @s guess here one way or another|pg||
nt|roswolf: the double by west was radical in my young days|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: or so it seems|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: welcome to Joe Shair |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  He was on the Argentina Under 18 International team at 16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think even east would ask 4N over 2@h could stop in 5 <worst scenario>|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@C|pg||
nt|olson: yes  clubs break  3/3  so he has  2 discards|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bal 15 count - heresy in the 1960's|pg||
nt|jtr: But will probably get a @d lead anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Actually, I wasn't.|pg||
nt|olson: or they fail to lead clubs and  hand makes|pg||
nt|fskoul:  2@C is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand and the decision to bid 1NT, rather than wait for a reopening X is reminiscent of a Spingold disaster last year...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: Nanev's hand typical F******y 11-15 range|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D i suppose|pg||
nt|daman: Italians cuebid  A  k  or singleton normally|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if weak nt, pretty frisky slam try by south|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Joe, we were talking about Madala|pg||
nt|henryb:  You came in in the middle of the discussion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: heart values were obv w opps, so even 11 easy to visualize|pg||
nt|daman: I suppose he might find the perfect hand 1 out of 1000 times|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S giving void/sgl|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: off 4 tricks on power|pg||
nt|daman: 5 tricks on ruffs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whew, you had me worried there for a moment...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: It seems to be universal in italy to play a lot of doubles just to show a good hand|pg||
nt|flash: this looks like a good hand to use for stretching, refilling cup/glass, etc...|pg||
nt|fskoul:  this lead will not be very unpleasant for Sementa.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: this will bring them to a grinding halt|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Fortunately for them. 5 should make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very diffused the use of Dbl to give interesting hand|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Unusual to double with 3-3 in the majors, but I think it's better than 1NT for two reasons. Partner is a passed hand, and Axx not the greatest holding for NT. Even if you disagree, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: it's hard to argue with the maestro's decisions; he has played a little before|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Nice little @S Q-J.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt was probably better by east to offer the choice of games|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he found a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: so i suppose if north had bid 3@H over 2@S that would have shown long hearts but minimum hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C means both controls (@D is obliged to go up 4@H)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D in North means Q or doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: the idea behind this bidding strategy is, if you have weak distributional hands you need to show your shape right away|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thik they don't use turbo - |pg||
nt|athene: with some strength you can slow the auction down, or try to slow it down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 4@h 5@C means almost 2 key cards and a hand with it is possible to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but not depending of key cards !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D by Lauria means that need anything more to play slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this way to bid need to have a great evaluation of hands by both palyers|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: normally should be off one, maybe two, by the way that was a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala has a brother (older) who is also quite good,and of course the father (adolpho) also excellent player |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S suggests north thought 3@D was a game-try for spades?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 5 is in jeopardy, but the 3c bid should help with the h guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: as I predicted    a @D lead on Board 3 would have beat 3NT    Fantoni led it in the OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually no real guess, since takes h out|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|daman: they lead a @S here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: answer of 1NT is costructive|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should make in comfort|pg||
nt|bridge_one: constructive (sry)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: quite an effective lead though|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: well always winner QTx/Ax , K with declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H is the card that is usefull to bid six|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: say declarer guessed well @c position, still 2 losers |pg||
nt|jcwla: I hope not.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you can see how is the way to evaluate the hand: step by step|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: 2NT by North was quite aggressive|pg||
nt|daman: yes Jim  5 is perfectly safe|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer can have a sigh of relief, makes now regardless of how hearts are|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the @cQ onside, declarer should make at least 3@h|pg||
nt|flash: 3@C made N-S on Board 20; 6 IMPs to Lavazza|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: @h finesse fails, prospects bleak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still down|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem odd, but what other explanation is there for 4@S?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not exist a different way to establish the full in the minors suit|pg||
nt|fskoul:  there are certainly some points of the play that required a fast claim|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: maybe he was thinking that south would just double then bid 3@D second round with a diamond hand|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|daman: on power|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this line is correct because if South ahve a other @S to return means @s splitted 4/3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so now there are the time to search the nine trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: looks like 3@C initiated a sign-off sequence|pg||
nt|athene: so double then double then diamonds isn't that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: maybe, what i am sure 1@s didn't promise a rose garden, and 11 with a stiff in vul vs nonvul 2N "weird"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently 3@C asked for shortage, 3@H showed x@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: when you play in this way the problem is when lead was from doubleton :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: But I still don't see a jump to 4@S.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: 2NT was a spade raise with a singleton somehere|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 morra tricks @cK and @d A for defenders, no where to park that losers|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well @DK more interesting than @HA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also true Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: The hands in this event have NOT been dull.|pg||
nt|daman: East will open 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Another slam swing on 19|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Slam failed in the other room on 19, so 13 more IMPs to Fornaciari|pg||
nt|athene: cash a top trump from hand first of course, to pick up 4-0 break either side|pg||
nt|bridge_one: xxxx in @S over the sgl is wonderfull for Versace !|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a bidding test for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: now a goulash|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i guess 5@d very hard to land but they may try|pg||
nt|daman: would we overcall 1NT with the South hand?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|athene: hand 18 was a 2@H opener|pg||
nt|athene: but this is 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i really don't understand these EW methods :)|pg||
nt|athene: some people might go 4NT with south|pg||
nt|olson: 5 @c best here|pg||
nt|olson: but 3n always wins |pg||
nt|jtr: Garozzo prefers to show his @ss rather than Michaels|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this might have been exciting but looks a straightforward game now|pg||
nt|jtr: Facing a passed hand it makes sense|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S is clearly better than 2@C (Michaels)|pg||
nt|olson: he may treat it like 5 4  and really wants spades  led  versus NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the vul is not conducive to adventures|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: un|pg||
mb|3C|nt|daman: I would rather bid 2Nt than 2@C   gets it off my chest|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get the reasoning behind pass of South|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that N-S didn't cash their @Ds, so they disappeared on declarer's @Hs - only way i can come close to that many tricks   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I wonder if N will double for t/o?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: unlucky 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2N as you said would be a "nice" decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Bocchi interested in a slam maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means strong bal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise 2@s (i suppose)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: defenders trump spots are quite strong|pg||
nt|daman: I'm not sure I would pass 2@C with the East hand|pg||
nt|olson: 2 losing spades may slow him down  and 2n rebid may be a minimum |pg||
nt|jtr: Madala interested in signing off asap:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however seems losers are 2@s and a @c with a working @d hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case East endplayed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or just play straightforward|pg||
nt|fskoul:  6@C could have a play with a different layout, but here there are too many obstacles|pg||
nt|flash: from West's perspective, the question is how many of East's values are 'wasted' in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@h looks excessive to me, but ...|pg||
nt|olson: is 4c  rkc ?|pg||
nt|olson: prob  not|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C forcing (of course) and means or stong hand or problem in a red suit to play NT|pg||
nt|flash: as Fotis noted, the trump split and the location of the @HK would have doomed 6@Cs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: the bidding is a bit bizarre really|pg||
nt|daman: West led 7th from his longest and strongest|pg||
nt|daman: transportation could be a big issue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: problems|pg||
nt|daman: On Board 19     6 @H was -1   so 14 IMPs to Sabbatini|pg||
nt|h_karluk: besides timing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hold up twice is normal|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like asking how good pards hand is?|pg||
nt|sybarra: make a guess Henry how many pages their system notes are?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I agree, but people are raising after x'ing far lighter than they did a few years ago.|pg||
nt|henryb:  well sure, Shirley, but even 2@s would be forward going|pg||
nt|henryb:  350|pg||
nt|flash: (although North wouldn't have had a comfortable lead??)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now the @H lead makes life much more confortable for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s stayed at a safe level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@d and 3@h for E/W|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: ugh |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d (instead 3NT) giving a not strong control in @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: given layout i think there's a need to hook @c J, but who knows, you know 3/3 break 35/.6 %|pg||
nt|daman: it would be hard to play West for 7 @Hs AND 4 @Cs imo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid with the North hand   lots of intermediates and a good hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt seam not natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C i think not drury (or reverse)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: Not a highlight reel set for N so far.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3Nt by Versace have a means different from natural bid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|daman: he is stuck in the mud insofar as communoication between both hands is concerned|pg||
nt|sybarra: but then they make their living this way |pg||
nt|athene: they have bid and made two horrible games and now play a good game in a partscore |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, I must run - thanks Roland, Hamdi, Bill, and all specs.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Italian open team for the European Championships in Belgium next month: Lauria-Versace, Duboin-Sementa (playing in the other room) and Bocchi-Madala. No room for Fantoni-Nunes. ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|olson: good stop |pg||

nt|peachy: what would be your bid, 2H maybe?|pg||
nt|daman: let's see what fantoni does|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: he can never guess West is void in @S     East did not rebid his 6 bagger over 2@C|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i did not see any magic wand:)|pg||
nt|athene: when you bid 3@D on that hand of course you hope to get a chance to show your second suit later|pg||
nt|daman: no   double in the passout|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H in a live auction can get you massacred|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, thats more like it. I misunderstood|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||

nt|jtr: Major game on thin values here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It must be a strong team when you can afford to leave out the world's 1st and 3rd ranked players|pg||
nt|jtr: Which will be reached now|pg||
nt|flash: another double-partial swing:  2@D made 3; we're all even|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the match is very interestin - only 3 at 2 means good bridge !|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might generate some action|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: transfer opening bids?  :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing like opening 1@D to pick off the opposition's 6-6 fit |pg||
nt|daman: 1NT by South      maybe they open 15 - 17 in first red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: both pairs were playing weak NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: 2@s shows heart support with a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h seems fine for NS|pg||
nt|chick: EW have a reasonable sacrifice in diamonds, but apparently they aren't going to find it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is why you should be able to bid 2@D natural against Precision players|pg||
nt|athene: interesting north doesn't overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 and an exotic flower|pg||
nt|daman: well   he has 15|pg||
nt|peachy: unless variable range, looks like it George|pg||
nt|daman: that's what I thought|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry specs, I don't have conv card to load|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if 15 is top of range, i wonder why n would act over 1nt|pg||
nt|daman: it has to be if North bid 2@C to invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 5@dx-2 would be excellent in MPs|pg||
nt|daman: I think it has to be 15-17 in forst seat red Jim|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see, ok that makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s is a make with @s3-2 and both black suits behaving|pg||
nt|athene: lots of hundreds for NS here|pg||
nt|athene: they could have made 4@H with good guessing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: molti italiani chiedono commenti in italiano ..... sry, ma vedono da tutto il mondo, così forse è giusta la scelta di commentare solo in inglese (:|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks are on in NT with Kx doubleton in @C also with @d 5/0|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S depending on style|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use 3@H giving the value|pg||
nt|athene: east obviously following some sort of relay sequence here - maybe 3@D asking for shape and 3@S the singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, if they don't bid game, you don't have to sacrifice|pg||
nt|daman: reached the normal contract the hard way|pg||
nt|daman: a lot of pressure on your judgement on auctions such as this|pg||
nt|daman: he will pick up the @C suit for one loser on this auction as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and it was different than last year|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now Board 22 gets even more interesting, we must see if Sabbatini will avoid the slam |pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  about 17%|pg||
nt|henryb:  does not have much choice in the play|pg||
nt|olson: it is a strong team , I think their record would get them a spot,  but you probably leave off this NS pair  because of less experience  |pg||
nt|jtr: If Garozzo had not bid it would have been tough|pg||
nt|olson: any of the 4 pairs  surely deserving|pg||
nt|athene: but it does look odd for east to bid anything other than 3nt over 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here anticipate a controls bec choose to play @D suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: @d obv artificial forcing, 3@h stop, hard to reach game, normal result|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|daman: this will cause some difficulty   but he will still make|pg||
nt|santyclz: Both of the partners seem to have taken normal actions however.  They are both near the bottom of their ranges but the vulnerability favors agression.|pg||
nt|daman: East must be gagging|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt limit+ raise|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: hearts friendly|pg||
nt|athene: a nice no-loser club suit|pg||

nt|h_karluk: more counting - a must !|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think there is any signalling system yet invented that assures partner with 100% certainty you have a particular card :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: might have got uppercut for spade ten|pg||
nt|daman: I would not bid 2@S red ever|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i totally agree, daman|pg||
nt|daman: must be testosterone    or maybe  red wine|pg||
nt|daman: or both|pg||
nt|wygbe1: plus a vicodin chaser|pg||
nt|jtr: He had not played for Italy during 2 years so could change|pg||
nt|olson: Did Bocchi play for Spain  in recent years ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is a test of sorts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strange stop at 3@S in this hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk5: Norberto Bocchi has been living in Barcelona for some now. He has a Spanish wife and they have two daughters|pg||
nt|athene: true, if you do pick up the falsecard you get serious bragging rights, but still, seems odd :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: i go ti see how they can stop at 2@S in the previous hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: nine tops in 3NT for EW here, may be awkward to reach |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @c|pg||
nt|daman: washed down with a double rum and coke|pg||
nt|Walddk5: *some time|pg||
nt|Walddk5: He never played for Spain, though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: italian federation asked to comment only in english|pg||
nt|roswolf: another limit+ raise |pg||
nt|bridge_one: please, stop to ask me why not in italian, thx :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: South will compete for sure|pg||
nt|fskoul:  no I haven't. But AQxxx with no spot is a very good alternative to the xx in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|h_karluk: Lanzarotti&Buratti once a very strong pairs, seems their ban lifted, however they didn't stop to register festivals as a pro pair|pg||
nt|daman: since North did not open a weak 2/multi    he is stuck|pg||
nt|daman: does 3@S show a @H tolerance?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: simple sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: they built up a system aptly named "nightmare"|pg||
nt|daman: all his partner did was overcall   and now they are commited beyond 3@H    which could be a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he has a collection shouts speak now or remain silence at all|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does this pair play Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not opposite a passed hand anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bocchi thinking of stepping in?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D = balanced hand (or natural) dpending on sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s means balanced hand|pg||
nt|flash: (hint - if you tend to always lead 4th from your longest and strongest, partner will seldom be able to gripe too loudly)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: do we think EW stole them blind?|pg||
nt|roswolf: tiger double|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: i guess Massimo would try for a slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be. And double would be music to Madala's ears|pg||
nt|athene: EW do seem to always bid the next step up when they have a good hand, so it's some sort of relay system of doom|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C i suppose strong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: yes, no fear EW|pg||
nt|daman: bold as brass|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: still a hope maybe Vittorio pulls |pg||
nt|daman: such a weird hand|pg||
nt|athene: lauria will fall asleep unless east bids diamonds, in which case he might double for the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|daman: nice lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems @sK lead would work well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Madala almost has best hand at the table |pg||
nt|santyclz: Too rich for my blood.  2@ds seems about right.|pg||
nt|olson: needed spade ace  to beat this one  , always hard to know  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: in the previous hand the stop at 2@s is lucky but possible - after 1@S open the bid of 2@s with 4333 and 8 hcp is correct - also the pass by opener (without sgl and normal streght ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: is correct)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|henryb:  what's this almost bit white woman? :)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Now if anyone knows the Sementa-Duboin system he can help us a bit|pg||
nt|flash: they haven't talked me out of leading the @HQ here...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|flash: 2@C appears to be any game force (2 of a red suit requires 5-card length)|pg||
nt|flash: that's 5th, not 4th...   but gripe away   :)|pg||
nt|fskoul:  the @H2 is quite imaginative, but unsuccesful|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he knows he will be the opening leader|pg||
pc|d5|nt|flash: 2@S the default call after the 2@C response; 2NT natural; 3@D expressing concern about that suit...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  both 6@s and 6@c will make with the favorable breaks, but 3N is much more likely|pg||
nt|athene: probably 11 tricks here, courtesy of 3-3 clubs and the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|fskoul:  probably 3@H must have shown @H length, so Intonti thought it better to try finding Hx @H in his partner|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: on balance    this is the best lead   because S bid 4@D|pg||
nt|daman: they have no tricks on the side other than trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but you know @sK already hooked, so why not @h A with p|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case you score 3 trumps and hope a trick on an side suit|pg||
nt|daman: it's hard to decide if that is enough     you need 4 tricks to beat it|pg||
nt|daman: the peril is if North had AQJxxx       but then he would have opened|pg||
nt|daman: looks like THE LAW plays a role on this one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: when your stiff @sK obviously hooked @h lead really passive, best to look for a ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the double will net 2 imps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: aside from HCP of course|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
mc|9|nt|bridge_one: yes, to stop at 2@S isn't correct (because the game is high %) - but the bid was correct ...|pg||

nt|peachy: and I had Fantunes as teammates other table...|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|daman: would we open the South hand a weak NT?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this year played also Garozzo in italian champion team |pg||
nt|fskoul:  the Italian style is very often "attitude: |pg||
nt|fskoul:  but in the end we have another good result for Lavazza|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: weak N in action|pg||
nt|daman: halfway through the session and a 1 IMP diff    good stuff|pg||
nt|athene: but if you are going to reserbe the option of finessing the @S10 i suppose you lead towards the @SQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am just wondering how high NSEW can go now|pg||
nt|olson: 6 @h would normally be a great spot,  not  today  |pg||
nt|flash: (for ACBL members, the 3rd and 5th notation on the convention card is simply wrong...   if you lead 5th from a 6-card holding, you'll be giving up the advantage of the lead system)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: We have been asked by the FIGB to provide English speaking commentators for both tables, so that is what we will stick to|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be trappy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Roland Wald (the director of BBO vugraph) ci ha appena detto che FIGB ha chiesto commentatori iin inglese per entrambi i tavoli - non è colpa nostra !|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: maybe 2N < dia bust >|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: *reserve|pg||

nt|Walddk5: You are desperately unlucky to go down in 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I have been worse *grand slams* I can assure you|pg||
nt|olson: 3 @h might catch a 4 @c cue|pg||
nt|olson: we know |pg||

nt|jtr: at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: tho obv stayman|pg||
nt|daman: they will get to the NT game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 3D i hope|pg||
nt|sybarra: and appears they do not play constructive raises |pg||
nt|daman: North opened that trash|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is rubinshool (like a cuebid at 2@H)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: no 3@C protection|pg||
nt|flash: either we have few, if any, ACBL members or everyone's in an agreeable mood today or no one's reading the commentary...   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 23/17 and interesting partscore battle|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from north now shows his hand perfectly well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess responsive double also an option|pg||
nt|athene: doubling when you can make a descriptive bid is a bit cruel to poor partner|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might think EW are in trouble|pg||
nt|wygbe1: these guys are hungry - on both sides of table|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm speechless|pg||
nt|daman: South will not stop below game|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding 7 would be 'lucky' here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is using up a lot of room|pg||
nt|olson: QXX of @D is  suspect  after a 3 @H try and he probably dislikes  3433  |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i know that's sort of a bee on your bonnet bid|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|daman: is this really the Italian Team Championships?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow|pg||
nt|bridge_one: look how both players use 2Nt for balanced stong hands|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now this contract is not expected to be very exciting, which allows a cup of coffee. Good for N-S to stop low, although the position of @DK allows 8 tricks for NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so, beind like 2@H bid, the menas depending on agreements (here seam 5@S GF)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|daman: and  would lead a @C as East|pg||
nt|roswolf: never hurts to be lucky|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding 4 is even luckier|pg||
nt|roswolf: i cant see why south should not pass 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: (told me about 5@S a strong italian kibitz that play frequently against BocchiMadala)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: with 2 bullets|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ssh walls have ears sir :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Vunerability is for... oh never mind.|pg||
nt|daman: with any luck    NS will bring this home   lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the contract is made because the loser @C over the @d|pg||
nt|flash: over a 1@D opener, a 1NT response tends to show @Cs; hence, Duboin's decision to look elsewhere for an opening lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@d fix @D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|daman: a @H lead would be the best|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|peachy: spade lead will kill diam entries and h lead open up H suit|pg||
nt|olson: e  wanted  to hear a 4 @C cue  and  decided  slam  probably not a good place|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: very nice guess with a fine reasoning|pg||
nt|athene: eight tricks are easy, assuming you find the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: the question is how to make nine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say as N you doubled, in case EW buys 1N that's Xmas for your side, if not still you can afford to buy it at 2 level in unbid suits|pg||
nt|athene: EW don't really have a suit they can attack so maybe you just plod away with the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, you are 6421 |pg||
nt|daman: 2@S    -300   cost Angelini  9 IMPs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 4@D fix and RKBW in @d - 4@s = 1/4 key|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose this is the means of auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because the cue in @S with sgl (partner suit) isn't ortodoxe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Geoffrey Giorgio specs and operator|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think both rooms who had similar auctions misjudged this hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult to stop at 3Nt after open by North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably Fantoni Nunes (with the cards of N7S) would stop at 3Nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well when players of this calibre do it it must be a difficult hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think the key is to bid 2Nt (by North) over 2@H giving 2 good stop in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy to read 5 hcp in @H by South after this auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still for me 2nt not only good @H stop but does suggest a better opening as well?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|daman: very tough now      North has the spots in @Hs to staunch the threat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however @sA wrong placed|pg||
nt|daman: and Qxx in @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot continue @Cs for profit|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot play @Hs|pg||
nt|daman: and @Ss gives the contract|pg||
nt|daman: he is skewered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sKj at table prospects are not bright for East|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would balance Shirley. Especially at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Table feel I suppose|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: the defence can't organise to set up two clubs AND a diamon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|athene: either dummy's third club will go on a diamond, or maybe the diamond will go on declarer's long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: depending what suit west leads here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the defence don't have the communication to make the thirty @c|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably jaap|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: now it is safe for Northe to play a @S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: placed @c9 to his partner|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: duck a @C?|pg||
nt|olson: he  is probably unhappy with dummy   until he sees the majors  split and the club offside  :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can play A in @c @c but after no possibility to make the 3th @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play also @C and @c - @d Ace, @C ruff, @S @S and Q in @h to last @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  And how does declarer make this after a @c return?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not losing the @D|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting on @C return|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can *duck* it but of course he looks silly if it's east who has the third club|pg||
nt|henryb:  he wins the club and?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C return @c again...|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, no, duck is bad :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 entry in the dummy to discard a loser @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is the best line of play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing small @d from dummy after the return @c is dangerous|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has two entries to hand to use the long club|pg||
nt|henryb:  actually, the strongest defense is a @h back|pg||
nt|athene: west can only knock one of them out (@HQ or @DA) when he wins the @C10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @d and @H beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so @H return seam the best defence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy after @h by East|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so on a heart lead, does declarer have to find the club duck to endplay east?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays two clubs, W wins and plays a @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after @H return to win need to play small @C !!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer plays a low @d E wins and plays a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very interesting hand !|pg||
nt|athene: the question is whether declarer can find this play of low club, playing east for the bare @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: he has to think what it means that east is worrying so hard now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jaap, probably you are right they don't use 2Nt natural in this sequence|pg||

nt|roswolf: routine for these players|pg||

nt|roswolf: but lavazza put the pressure on|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: come on|pg||
nt|jtr: He doesnt know about the @ss|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D and @D in open room by Versace - so 4! made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do you guarantee on a x@S return he will not play the K:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is just a quess the K or the J now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes specs DD we play @S :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: pull is very clear IMO|pg||
nt|daman: I cannot believe North passed that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he could bid pass, 2@H 2Nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is the more safe bid|pg||
nt|flash: over here, most would use a negative X there to show the majors and the 2@D call to show a limit raise in @Cs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: 4th from longest and strongest will work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am unsure about 1@s by E|pg||
nt|h_karluk: operator, is everything ok there please? :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think we need two passes then this auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think West is supposed to start with 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: either that or they put the board on the table rotated through 180 degrees|pg||
nt|athene: that's most likely actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N off to a small @s lead or @sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -2, so 200+130=330 which it's 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but to be sure let's wait and see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: HE PLAY THE BOARD INVERSED|pg||
nt|wygbe1: wow, n must have loaded up on steroids before this match|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a direct approach from West, but one suspects it will be unsuccessful|pg||
nt|sybarra: this goes in the soup |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: this is a pianola hand    it plays itself       a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: NORTH IN SOUTH ECC...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 Imps to ew|pg||
nt|athene: yes right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzth: THE RESULT IS CORRECT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a breakpoint, match were tied 18-19|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: @S 2|pg||
nt|daman: the 10 is a big card|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok bets on now (I vote for K)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: Passive works here|pg||
nt|olson: he cannot make  playing  on minors  so  spades  only chance|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: and you have transportation|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: everyone open 1@s? Or 1@c?|pg||
nt|flash: great matchpoint spot   :)    a @C partial a bit safer??|pg||
nt|fskoul:  certainly|pg||
nt|flash: Board 23 in as a push|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and Bocchi also led a @C :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: bravo Riccardo|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: @H7 might start to loom large|pg||

nt|jtr: And another potential slam|pg||
nt|flash: 140, we'd think...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: theonly indication was the pause by S in returning x@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: well in a sense going off was no disaster with the result in the ither room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: might end up here with north saccing over 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS will get pummeled if they keep this up|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: can make 4@H if they get there|pg||
nt|Walddk5: My Italian is non-existent, so not sure I can explain properly|pg||
nt|jtr: eh?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: But we have a (former) South American here, we can expect to be faster.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't think EW easily would give up|pg||
nt|athene: north in the other room never bid - 1@D opener did take some of the wind out of his sails i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, 2nt over 2@H looks very plausible|pg||
nt|olson: not  1 @H|pg||
nt|jtr: Pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: a more sedate board|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: gee|pg||
nt|peachy: some mixed or preempt raise,|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: light 1NT response - very popular these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed 2 @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 lol gee whiz|pg||
nt|daman: :(|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmmm|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt superaccept xfert|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: N really does not have a bid|pg||
nt|daman: notm opposite a passed hand really|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however, 2@S was not what North had in mind |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose pass to 1@h <unless otherwise stated in sys card>|pg||
nt|athene: super-accept leads to easy 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: correct Joe, always a joy to comment on the So. American vugraph,  it is at sprint speed |pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like seven tricks for declarer|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|fskoul:  4@S is reasonable to bid, but when dummy goes dummy you always wish you could avoid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is IMP style - with 5/4 and 14 hcp need|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls i can not answer to all the why questions specs (sometimes there are no mathematical or technical explanations)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many would bid 2! here |pg||
nt|bridge_one: also in open room 3@H raise (2 is dangerous)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a @D a@S and mb a @H to lose : will take some time so coffee break suggested|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: very light responses can work well in a strong club system, where there is a strong likelihood that it is EW's hand - you amke it difficult for them to come in |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: good news you can finesse to @sJ, bad news but which direction :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: they could have bought this in 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: and now they have to struggle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very much|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still threats to ruff 3rd @h|pg||
nt|daman: Sabbatini    retakes the lead    they won 6 on  24    played in the normal 2@S   they we in 4@H -3 at this table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oy|pg||
nt|daman: this is like a ping pong match|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think maximum with 4 cards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: vey|pg||
nt|athene: EW can go for the four obvious tricks (spade, some aces, @C ruff)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h over 2@d would be 4 cards raise minimum|pg||
nt|flash: unfortunately, i haven't found a grid of results on the web page; i haven't watched all the matches, so i'm not sure whether the last round will be Lavazza-Angelini or if they've ...|pg||
nt|flash: already played|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: here, obviously, it hasn't worked so well |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bad pass and bad lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: but one board doesn't prove anything.|pg||
nt|peachy: with a singl diam, he might|pg||
nt|athene: good lead, otherwise declarer might have time to set up a spade for the club pitch and 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wah wah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however West still dominates|pg||
pc|c4|nt|flash: any of the specs have an answer to the last-round match-ups?|pg||
nt|flash: not yet played, i'm told|pg||
nt|fskoul:  The Italians usually use a "delayed" RR system, which "shufles" the rounds in order to delay the match between the two leading teams|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  although an eighth is available in @d|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine the operator is trying to ctach up|pg||
nt|jtr: catch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: he is trying for the @D trick |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh west quit to have a @h ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, he is trying for a ruff|pg||
nt|daman: nah   he needed to hear 3@D from South before he would consider game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good line by Madala|pg||
nt|bridge_one: start fixing @S is a good choise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flash: so, if you didn't set you alarm (or stay up) to watch Garozzo in action in the first match today, perhaps tomorrow's match will be worth the extra effort/ sacrifice of sleep|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3@h ok now, 3N questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N <esp by E> good|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT by East|pg||
nt|olson: 24 and 26 correct now|pg||
nt|fskoul:  Board 24 gave Lavazza 11 IMPs. The critical point is that declarer was denied a 2nd entry in dummy to establish his spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: EW might end up in a @S partscore here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: Board 26 corrected|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D = majors weak|pg||
nt|flash: 3NT down 1 on 24...   |pg||
nt|fskoul:  So he reverted to the @C, but both @C honors were misplaced|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i asked Madala comment the line of play many times - he is the faster man in the world :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lavazza is routing for an easy win this round|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: normal lead @sJ, @dA+ruff hard to visualize|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: 2@c normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s dicey|pg||
nt|santyclz: Usually 4-6 imps on that.|pg||
nt|daman: and an invite by West|pg||
nt|bridge_one: look: 3Nt for N/S here !|pg||
nt|athene: hard to get there, given the NS spade stoppers |pg||
nt|bridge_one: the 2@D open worked very well|pg||
nt|athene: not to mention the lack of values|pg||
nt|flash: to see how that happened, click on Movie; click on Open Room; highlight the board and use the Next button to move through the play of the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: slowly slowly catchee monkee|pg||

mb|5H|nt|bridge_one: impossible to come into the auction by N/S|pg||

nt|fskoul:  you are right, it's exactly there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some specs do expect a push here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I would have bid 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: little nibbles - can add to a big bite|pg||
nt|jtr: It may be sacrilege but i hate 1@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @h2 or @s9 close decisions|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get murky|pg||
nt|jtr: X is 4+ @ss i imagine|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wd specs:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt isn't so clear with 4 trumps and sgl in @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: why should north/south double? a reflex action due to the vul no doubt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S could think to make 5@H, so they can think 5@S a defence ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nice idea : it needs @HA and x@C with small chance to beat this|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: in 12-14, I suppose E is max|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this can be a swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S instead 2Nt (or also 3@S splinter - so limited hand)) would work better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but i think declarer plays the K then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with regard to the 1@H opening|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: when SQ is facing 4-cards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: overboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North cam switch to @D10 when in with @HK, so can defeat 4@H |pg||
nt|daman: not the lead that hurt|pg||
nt|daman: he will make this or more|pg||
nt|daman: 2 rounds of trumps ending in dummy and then a low @D?|pg||
nt|daman: seems reasonable even if trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or still @h ruff|pg||
nt|daman: he could ruff 2 @Hs yes     but South would get to pitch |pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|daman: he has a few options available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he has no idea of @d A location|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ignored top of nothing, led m.u.d.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so push very likely|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|olson: 3n makes  but not a great spot  |pg||
nt|olson: every card is right  for  NS|pg||
nt|jtr: Hence 1@s shows 3 card support|pg||
nt|roswolf: making is all the justification it needs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about developing the @D:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better not|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he is thinking how make the contract with @S 3/0|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but @S 3/0 need @D 4/2 ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but if @D are 5/1 lose a ruff in @d ...|pg||

nt|ritong: this auction shows the interest of double= 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can't think at A@C position ! need to be in North |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he jus5t plays cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: well, may not lose a heart if North cashes @CA|pg||

pc|hK|nt|daman: gag|pg||

nt|fskoul:  so in a way South's decision to pass was a winning one. Now we have to see if Sementa will find the @CQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: with nada, north would simply pass and stay in the 4/3 fit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however if we are talking about std signals, sure, @s ten asks for @h switch|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he needed that much for 2@c though|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair points|pg||
nt|jtr: Hence only 2NT|pg||

nt|athene: i imagine they will play 6@H, although 6nt is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: 4 more hands  for Fornaciari tem to even up the score|pg||
nt|roswolf: homer nodded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would not dare to say about fantonii mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a distraction by Nunes - after A in @S and @S 2/1 could play different - also with @d 3/3 only 2 discards over the @D, so K in @C must be in good position|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: and that was 2 way, somehow inspired|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be fun |pg||
nt|athene: if you have oodles of HCP and two trick sources, you sometimes want to play in notrumps because then even if one suit breaks badly you survive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both finesses are onside|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|daman: they will not get to the cold slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for NS |pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|athene: but if that's your trump suit with two losers, it doesn't matter if you have 15 winners elsewhere|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it happen, overl all after many day of competition|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hear that his cat did hit the x@D on his keyboard?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 2@S some kind of diamond raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h singleton?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: again 2 way finesse , this time @h suit|pg||
nt|daman: they have lost the @D suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: another flat 3nt?|pg||
nt|jtr: 25 was flat but not in the way we originally imagined|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: in North America    we ipen the South hand 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: either 6@h+3@c+1@d+3@s or finesse to @d K brings 13 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: as a general game-force?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic |pg||
nt|fskoul:  now a lead problem for East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now Lavazza is very near to win the italian champion|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Board 25 in as a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: they have got quite high under their own steam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA lead would be very friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have good vlaues, so perhaps it is unrealistic for them to stop low |pg||
nt|daman: open*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tartan 2?|pg||
nt|sybarra: madala in with 3 @s is my guess |pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he wants to bid 4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: stayman or transfer than new suit GF|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: opening 1@C seems weird to me|pg||
nt|jtr: It would seem so Geoff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: 2@S obviously something cunning|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d ok here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Last round this|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|fskoul:  the seemingly "safe" 9 @D lead allows declarer to establish 3 diamonds tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: Angelini might cash, knowing his partner is broke, well see|pg||
nt|peachy: even if he doesnt, just overtrick or two at stake.  But he cant realisticlaly expect his partner to have an entry in this auction|pg||
nt|wygbe1: working this hard with one imp at stake, down 27, not really energy efficient|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like the modern puppet stayman idea|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H = no major|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 3@S to force 3nt, but if he bid 3nt right away , that would be 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|drewsky: Declarer should duck this trick|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you play it that way round (rather than responder's 3@S = 5-4 majors) to rightside a possible 4@S contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i fear we witnessed a very rare mistake and proves also Fantni is human|pg||
nt|bridge_one: before i writed Nunes, but was Fantoni to play - sry|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: @sK relieves any problems|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: so I do not go to track to day |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5 long day of competition are hard for all !|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: if 4NT was RKCB then 5NT asked for kings, so 6@D looks like one side king - but showing just the number of kings isn't much use so i can't believe that's what they are doing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: another breakpoijnt|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nor I.  I never expected a pass.|pg||
nt|fskoul:  now declarer has 6 tricks, but it is very unlikely to find a 7th|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: making 5   if they cash the @S    doink|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *breakpoint|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though south thought 6@D=@DK|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just works out the grand might be excellent and at worst will be on a finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mega difference of Di Lauria - world grandmasters ranking top 4 <best placing points owner> a living saga!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: i think he thought 3N disaster, then pushed|pg||
nt|athene: three options:- a) finesse @D (works)  b) finesse @S (works) c) play for @S-@D squeeze (doesn't work)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you might try to ruff the diamonds good as well|pg||
nt|athene: (throw dummy's diamond on the @CQ and ruff a diamond or two)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: Tutte le strade portano a Roma (All roads lead to Rome)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: The Law says to bid 3@s (nine trumps) but maybe with his soft values he was afraid EW might bid a missed game|pg||

nt|jaapfr: anyway he is not only one of worlds best players but also extremely nice person at the bridge table|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: If all bridge hands were balanced, the game would be boring. There are many combinations resulting from the deal of 52 cards. Many have weird shapes.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I suspect I don't fully appreciate how bad 3 cards in the opps unsupported suit it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: 3@S was not my choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and a funny superaccept, as i thought they will nicely land to 4@s, however @d lead will hurt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @c by south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, would 2NT be clubs and diamonds or simply natural? |pg||

nt|roswolf: south might raise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: what are they trying to accomplish/|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: specs suggest 2 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Di Lauria forced Angelini to play 7, as declarer he did his hard homework|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2/3 nt?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@H in OR with @D lead could claim 11 tricks trick 1|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: with one of my pards 2NT there would be 6@C4@d  |pg||

pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: and we still have 3 boards|pg||

nt|jtr: 2@s now and will West double again?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt by north means long @c (can't have a bal 18/19, he would open 2@D)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D now by South|pg||
nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for other events and local times|pg||
nt|fskoul:  EW will probably end in 2@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by Madala means support for not declared suits (4@s for sure)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Madala could have also a 4135|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: Presume 1@H was a xfer to @SS.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the first @H bid =spades |pg||

nt|olson: I would think he doubles 2 @S|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not need much to have a playable game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: extra value could be for distribution|pg||
mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass is a option - i would choose to play in suit with void @C|pg||
nt|athene: an ugly spot but at least they aren't in 3 (as north might have been tempted to bid)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this contract is not in jeopardy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now asking if they can play 3 nt |pg||
nt|olson: not  often I get a great  20 count with  nice pattern |pg||
nt|jtr: Some would use 2NT by East|pg||
nt|jtr: As 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as 4@d denied club stopper 4@s normal contract|pg||
nt|athene: hard to reach hand for the club up|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff is ok i guess|pg||
nt|athene: the mistake is to throw the club on this - you need that club loser to set up your tenth winner (@CQ)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks very optimistic|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: AKA Scramble|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d was ON here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: small software problem of BBO is when you reply to someone in private and at same moment he/she loggs off or loses connection ones reply is send to the room:(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the other line is to throw the club and ruff two hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer doesnt have a whole lot to think about here|pg||
nt|olson: 2n by east is best to show  playable in 2 suits  or  lebensohl  showing  extreme  weakness|pg||
nt|roswolf: strange choice by east surely either 2nt - a sort of scramble was better here|pg||
nt|ritong: the maestro might express some disapproval about 3@c|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think this is their way to sign off in 2@H, as opposed to suggesting going on|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: it seems a concensus exists|pg||
nt|olson: w could be  1354 and this  works ,  but  game in H  only needs 10 tricks ,  and E was hoping  to  find a spot  undoubled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|flash: while this is playing out...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: small to hand, @h hook works, +1 expected|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Gulbis against Nadal at Rome now - very great game !|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: nice try|pg||
nt|daman: I play the King|pg||
nt|athene: you just hope that ruffing two hearts won't give the defence two trump tricks (@SQ10x)|pg||
nt|jtr: Meanwhile, 3@c is no certainty|pg||
nt|olson: yes,  2n should not  be natural     scramble  is  common  treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice @sK by Madala|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Daniela Nante, for a great job!!!|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the FIGB, and particularly Gianluca Frola, for their sponsorship of this event|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this auction isn't perfect - but depending on agreements - after initial bid 4@S in North can't be - so Dbl would be a interesting hand or distributional|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fskoul:  I believe 2@C was some kind of forcing bid, requiring a 2@D response, and then 2@H shows an inv hand with 5 @H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: mind you|pg||
nt|daman: this might be one way he can make it|pg||
nt|flash: and to the organizers, particularly Vincenzo Delle Cave, for inviting us to participate|pg||

pc|d5|nt|flash: 2-way new minor forcing...   cross-eyedness has set in!!!|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if longer time THEN it says do you want to send a mail|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2Nt the 3@D can't be very strong hand (otherwise 3@D instead Dbl)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: then Bocchi couls pass 3@d (perhaps)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still 4@D C possible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: finess @S now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well proves that trump leads would be good|pg||
nt|roswolf: no real hope otherwise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but mb too DD|pg||
nt|jaapfr: countless different lines possible here|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2010/CXSQLBSG/turno.asp?serie=1&tipo=1&girone=1&turno=9  for results and standings|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: wd|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: a bit harsh to lose to the stiff ten :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||
nt|athene: usually you expect that if you get overruffed it will be from the trump trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they are working for a trick |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|athene: declarer in the other room had more information|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why deserved "wd" (!)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h J and claim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: now @D|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: this a losing option working if @D 3-2|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the initial return @D by Intonti was a perfect timing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: several specs are of course pointing out he didn't need to ruff the heart that east played into his @HAQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wygbe1: notice declarer's failure to lead the 9 on first round of spades left him poorly placed to finesse against south's spade jack - since suit blocked|pg||
pc|s9|nt|flash: Angelini's gained a few IMPs (and a few VPs) - Lavazza now ahead by 3|pg||

nt|athene: went|pg||
nt|wygbe1: lucky slam possible here, in h, clubs or nt|pg||
nt|olson: down  22|pg||
nt|olson: 2|pg||
nt|flash: last board now...   thnx for your help this session, Fotis; thnx, specs, for trying to keep us on the straight and narrow|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes another potential feisty hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   and http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php also http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all are very nice ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tools for you to enjoy more|pg||
nt|daman: inverted|pg||
nt|olson: 3n  would be a great  result  ew|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt and 5@C are ON for N/S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: thx Daniela  our terrific operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to my co-co's Henry, Joe and Mike   great fun guys |pg||
nt|jtr: X or @hs?|pg||
nt|fskoul:  and he has to either return a @C in the teenace, or concede a ruff and discard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: don't see that North can do much over this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d minimum 2Down Vulnerable, so no good defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: given layout 4@d very easy for EW|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yup rt|pg||
nt|jtr: Will Garozzo try 2NT?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdl conventional (many kind of hand)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C obliged|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he do not expect S to pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: I|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C obliged - after many means depending of agreements|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but what to bid????|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt means very strong one suit hand in @c|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt like north's a moment ago|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this sequence Dbl Rdl is typical in weak NT to save in a suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs whose comments keep us on the straight and narrow |pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess 1@S was F|pg||
nt|wygbe1: so ew were presented with two chances for large pickups by bidding grands - admittedly the second one incredibly lucky|pg||
nt|jtr: Nope went gently|pg||
nt|athene: but still hard for Lauria to find 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and not balanced ! (otherwise would open 2@D)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|daman: well done|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you for the last round of this competition and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has to bid 3@S now, I guess - not sure of the ramifications here |pg||
nt|athene: this won't take long|pg||
nt|athene: not once the @SQ appears anyway|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Daniela, Jordan, William, good work|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting view to pass this out|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: good decision|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|olson: he wanted  KQx  of  @H |pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe not that hard|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@C great card, sufficient to call game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: auto -1, aggressive try|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his @CA is worth about 10 hcp|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: not match ponts so this is not the worse spot |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@S makes|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps they aware of approx standing and didnt fight much|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what is going through his mind?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: God knows:)|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the @D 9?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, bye for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure when we are back  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i confess i would have doubled to compete|pg||
nt|jaapfr: expected final score 34-21 much closer than early on|pg||
pc|h5|nt|olson: a calm  130  here to end the set|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 110|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: should think stolen fruit has a special flavor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if X then as S i am afraid my pd jumps in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for example: 1Nt Dbl 2@c = 3+@c, not 5 cards in a suit - 2@D = 4@D and 4 in a major, ,,, but there are a lot of agreements - can look at CC convention of a pair at high level and ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you will find all you want|pg||
nt|roswolf: true jaap there was certainly risk |pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: previous hand 3@D by N/S, so swing for Sabbatini|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: 1@C 1@D - so start small @C from South need (very hard to find Qxx in West after the overcall 1@D)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ty all for watching !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here will continue with other time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: last turn tomorrow in the morning|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BYE ! |pg||
nt|flash: the big match-up of Angelini vs Lavazza scheduled for tomorrow - in just under 15 hours|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: now he makes the rest|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fskoul:  2@C will lose 3 trump tricks and 1 trick in each major, but a good result for EW|pg||
nt|flash: double-partial swing again on Board 28, extending the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: off to the Open Room; thnx again|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
