nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzpx: 1@C was 15+ and 1@H showed GF with a balanced hand|pg||

nt|djneill: the @d lead was reasonable, even if led something else, the @d switch would be hard to avoid - the dummy was so weak in @d it seems unlikely West would have both the @dA and @dQ ...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|djneill: East should probably double rather than bid 2@d, in my eyes|pg||

nt|djneill: 4@d, 4@c, 2 Aces at least, all South has to do is hold up a few spades to cut communication between the E-W hands, so might just make 9 tricks |pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1991 was the year when Iceland came to a complete standstill. People were up all night to listen to radio coverage of the event. Iceland had their first world champions. Even the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: session in the national parliament (Alþingi) was adjourned to announce the fantastic result in Yokohama. A nation with just 310,000 inhabitants!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure,,,,E might have bid with 7 spades. i think he is considering discarding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ine of the world champions is North at this table|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 to HFV on 10 -- they made 2@H with two overtricks while GT failed by one here.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i believe Iceland has the oldest parliament in Europe. i dont mean the legislators, but the institution|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: thank you too shirley :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|djneill: it should have been better of course, had N-S found the @d slam - maybe South's choice of 3@h rebid was off the mark - 3@d would have gotten the only real suits in play (@h was ...|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|marlowepi: so everyone played a diamond partial. how odd, considering the number of times that commentators have noted the rarity of partscores in thios event (and country). one might have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that at least one pair would bid 3N with 26HCP & all suits multiple stopped. live & learn|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|chick: pretty brave vul X with 12 HCP |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: suit not good enough for 3H|pg||
nt|djneill: North removes to 2@c to accentuate the distribution, rather than pass and bid 2@c later - does not really want to penalize with such long @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pass not on the menu|pg||
nt|chick: pass looks right to me, after a 11-15 opening, and forcing your side to the 3 level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: canadian spec notes that the first speech ever given in the Icelandic Parliament in 930 is still on record: "How the hell did we miss England by this much??"|pg||
