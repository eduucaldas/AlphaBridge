nt|georgej: I bid better than I count|pg||

mb|1N!|an|10+ FG May 4M|mb|p|nt|lc: Yes, 5@C is excellent -- let's see if they can avoid 3NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 5@C is much better than 3NT. |pg||
nt|georgej: Should be easy to reach and easy to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|lc: Most pairs have the mindset to bid 3NT first.  5-of-a-minor as a last resort.|pg||
nt|gtusa: true|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 14+ (good 12/13) 4+ clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|lc: AT IMPs, though, which this is, I find too many pairs fall into the 3NT trap more than they should.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in some matches, W could block the spade suit at 3N|pg||
nt|georgej: Nunes has upgraded his 5th cub|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 10+ balanced, forcing to game I think|pg||
nt|gtusa: K@d is the magic card for Fantoni to choose the right game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has too much of his stuff in N's suits to do more than hint diffidently at NT|pg||
nt|georgej: When he leads the 8, declarer might WIN the first spade|pg||
nt|petergill: With the auction already being game-force, they should be able to identify the spade weakness and get to 5@C not 3NT. |pg||
nt|lc: A Standard auction might also begin 1@C-1NT -- Then 2@D -- and I agree, 3NT should NOT be reached -- but surely will at some tables.|pg||
mb|3D|an|6-4 17-20|mb|p|nt|georgej: Marshall: Diffidently is a banned word here as nobody else knows what it means|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petergill: If North had Jx, K, AQxx AK97xx, they have (had? after 3@D?) enough space to identify in that case to bid 3NT. That's why the 1NT GF response is so useful. |pg||
nt|gtusa: nunes solved the problem with 4@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: just trying to get siomeone to notice me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi gabriele|pg||
nt|lc: So, the Italians reached the inglorious 5@C on a 4-3 fit on the first board, down 1.|pg||
nt|lc: Why doesn't this ever happen when they play against me?|pg||
nt|georgej: In the USA 2 match, both tables have reached 5 Clubs|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lc: at the other table, here, Woolsey-Stewart will start with a strong @C which "should" make it easy to reach 5@C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if they can get to 5C with a 43 fit, ought to be able to do so with 11 of them|pg||
nt|petergill: 4-6, must be a singleton or void in one major, thus Qxx is not enough for 3NT, most of the time |pg||
nt|lc: Note the quotes areound :"Should."|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 5@C W -1 on Bd 17 gives USA1 11 imps. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: the play will take 4.3 seconds|pg||
nt|georgej: I knew they would reach game|pg||
nt|gtusa: some misunderstanding in open room?|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin - Sementa are a new partnership and still have teething problems in their bidding sometimes. |pg||
nt|lc: Of the 3 Italian pairs, certainly Sementa-Duboin is the newest partnership.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|gtusa: they dont have any gun, right?|pg||
nt|georgej: Still you would think they might sniff at 5-4 @H|pg||
nt|lc: On the USA1 team, we have 3 long-time pairs.  Although they aren't doing well this week.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: fulvio suggesting not to take a long time|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin - Sementa stopped in 3@h on Bd 18. |pg||
nt|lc: They breezed through the Tream Trials to become USA1 in June -- won every match easily.|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 22: Some tables obviously got interference, with those 1400's and 1700's, which might have made bidding the grand much harder. |pg||
nt|lc: Okay -- last board.  They have played 16 in 1 hour 20 minuted (1 passout).  Very fast.|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgej: In my next book; "bidding for your partner", I discuss that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lc: Did East really open 1@D????????|pg||
nt|marlowepi: >|pg||
nt|petergill: If I were playing against George Jacobs and George Jacobs, I would interfere in the auction.  |pg||
nt|lc: I doubt it.|pg||
nt|lc: Vugraph???????|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|9-11 GF 5+|nt|marlowepi: not me|pg||
nt|petergill: No - South opened 1@D - |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: tyyyy|pg||
nt|lc: Much more sensible.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|not necessarily strong|nt|georgej: It was a tactical 1@D by Doub|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Marty Bergen used to refer to it as "testical."|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: from Ridgling, NJ ?|pg||
nt|lc: This will not do well after 4th from longesty and strongest.|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board already. Thanks to everyone. For once, I'm brief.   |pg||
nt|lc: But, the @C10 or @C9 could block things up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: In fact, I think -1 with @C6 or @C7 lead, making otherwise if dec guesses @D.|pg||
nt|petergill: Which club would you lead, Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: low, of course -- I see all 52.|pg||
nt|lc: In real life, I would need to know what the bids mean.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: high club spot probably contraindicated with this bidding by S|pg||
nt|petergill: I would lead @C10. |pg||
nt|lc: An hones man!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lc: Doub gets it right.|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead by Doug Doub|pg||
nt|georgej: I admit I would lead the 10 and probably block it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Not that declarer would have made it anyway -- he still would have had to guess to work on @D and guess them right-- far from clear.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has shown a lot of red cards, so low club better i think|pg||
nt|lc: As opposed to woring on @S.|pg||
nt|petergill: Can Doug hear what you write, Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|georgej: Adam hasn't gone up yet|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lc: THe educated @Cj play  .|pg||
nt|lc: Could be right.|pg||
nt|georgej: I am so good|pg||
nt|lc: For example, switch the @CQ and @CK and see how the @CJ works better.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D can be made, but NS ran out of space to discover that the clubs were not quite adequate for 3NT. |pg||
nt|georgej: the 7 is also looking high to him|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, if declarer has, say @CQ10xx,  @CK10xx , etc.  @CJ is right play.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, declarer is not home yet.|pg||
nt|georgej: This would lave been a good place to lie and lead the 6|pg||
nt|lc: He has to decide which pointed suit to work on.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best chabce here as cards lie is to return club 8:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: give them one more chance top block suit:)|pg||
nt|georgej: Which are the pointed suits?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: zoot|pg||
nt|lc: I got a little weary here myself, dyslexic in the @D -- they are offside, it seems -- .|pg||
nt|georgej: Why not take the legit line of favorable spades?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lc: Switch the E-W @D and @D work -- but @S better odds.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was not touting my line george....i said best chance as cards lie :)|pg||
nt|georgej: good play of the 10|pg||
nt|lc: Amusing falsecard.|pg||
nt|petergill: Wildavsky can see @d's not running, and spades not running (North is a passed hand), so Adam Wildavsky covers partner having @CQ10876 or similar. |pg||
nt|lc: Now declarer could get tempted to try another top @D -- and go down extra.|pg||
nt|petergill: with @CJ play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good point peter, though the primary reason was no doubt to provide for N having club king instead of queen|pg||
nt|georgej: A Kib suggests that the @D10 is Smth|pg||
nt|georgej: or Smith|pg||
nt|lc: Could well be.|pg||
nt|lc: That means he "likes the opening lead suit."|pg||
nt|lc: Which he surely does.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|petergill: vs NT on EW CC: "hi-lo by 3rd hand in declarer's 1st suit shows present natural count in opening leader's suit." |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it seems he played the ten of D quite smithly|pg||
nt|petergill: No Smith Echos on their CC|pg||
nt|lc: Peter, you are a wealth of information.  Thank you!|pg||
