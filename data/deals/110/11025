mb|3D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: well, after 3@D by South ... maybe|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: complicated by the bad trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: keys to auction:  a) how forcing is North 2@D  b) what exactly does South 3@D promise|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  Needs to play hearts correctly by leading from North so East can only ruff a loser|pg||

nt|ahollan1: aha  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: thanks Felipe|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobh1: the usual confusion when they open a minor that could be short|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobh1: in this case VERRY short|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but at this level, you'd hope situation was discussed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: instead of hope - make that expect|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: you would hope that|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the RR you play so many different teams|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That makes sense because North's cue bid is normally forcing to suit agreement so South could just bid 2@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they meet in the KO stage, that will be discussed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this is situation where there should be default agreement about bidding over opponent Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: sure, but there are different kinds of precision 2@d bids as well|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 2@d is at least 2 that's one thing; if it could be a void, that might be different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Austberg just had a brain cramp|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Saelensminde|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so for my cramp -- it's time for a coke|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row where opponent holds 4 trump -- that can be exhausting|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Is this still makeable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my remaining money on defense|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|bobh1: they always break badly at this level|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|danilo1: after getting @D count  .. @DA and @D = danger of endplay ... but @SA and @S ... simply not enought tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: only in sectionals or club games are the trumps always 3-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passive defense is good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bad breaks in rubber bridge too|pg||
nt|bobh1: depends on the stakes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always more than i can afford to lose |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think it must be correct to play hearts initially before trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now any high black card|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a very natural system with 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|danilo1: 4@S could be made ... declarer should play second @H from hand much earlier |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10 winning doesn't really help if declarer wants to take @D tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would play that 3n shows a different hand than this|pg||
nt|bobh1: this hand is 2n|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 2@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: but i prefer 2n|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT OK ... North should not have 4-card @S ... why showing them to opps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  One @c10 scores, safest way is to just set up 2 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3n shows long @hs, often solid or nearly so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when it holds - just attack from dummy to ensure 9   in fact low @S Aronov may not play Queen!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but declarer had to think about what to do if @C10 was covered -- we didn't|pg||
