mb|2H|mb|d|nt|joest: yes but the players at the table rarely have the chance to make their full case under the time constraints of playing|pg||
nt|finch: OK, that you aren't allowed to appeal just because you disagree with the original ruling|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2 hearts is hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h = 5 hearts + a 4+ card minor; weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|joest: hi Roy and Frances|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: not an appetizing hand to respond with as west|pg||
nt|royhughes: No, indeed, and Brogeland makes a conservative response|pg||
nt|finch: 2@S an interesting choice as West has sufficient values to make a constructive call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which do you suggest, Frances?|pg||
nt|joest: assuming Lebensohl yes: 3@c at least has clubs + shows something|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT would not be natural|pg||
nt|finch: as well as every suit stopped.  He really wants to bid a natural 2NT, but that's probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2S could turn out well if partner is minimum with 4 spades and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|finch: 3@C, showing constructive values is the 'normal' call opposite a normal takeout double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: The players are using screens so a pause before seeing North's pass doesn't mean he was thinking, it means one of N and E was|pg||
pc|h2|nt|finch: East debating whether to commit to spades or suggest NT.  With so many extra HCP 2NT a good choice|pg||
nt|royhughes: It also caters to partner having only 3 spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: no news about the appeal as yet - you will know as soon as I hear something official|pg||
nt|joest: note the low from three small lead in partner's suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|joest: typical expert practice unless you have raised|pg||

mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jallerton: No, Al.  Reverse Drury would be playing 1@h-2@h as constructive and 1H-2@c as a poor raise|pg||

nt|finch: The lack of a 4@H cue has caused me some confusion|pg||
nt|joest: or a 3@h call|pg||
nt|jbgood: he preferred to show short clubs - and didnt have for another slam invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 3@H possibly would have been natural, rather than a cue bid|pg||

nt|joest: now Boye can count the tricks if he plays for four diamond tricks and thinks parter has at least three clubs|pg||
nt|finch: Knowing about club shortage opposite (I assume that's what 4@C meant) makes the East hand huge|pg||
nt|joest: and it's hard to imagine a 2NT bid with club shortness but lacking a heart control|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland knows he discouraged - still prd is grand interested|pg||
nt|finch: even lacking a heart control, the 5-level looked safe from East's hand|pg||
nt|finch: One popular method over intervention is to play the double by opener shows shortage in the suit bid|pg||
