nt|vugraphzwa: (they are still playing that last board, hence the non-bidding here)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: over now|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 1st link above shows the matches for tomorrow (USA time) 10AM East / 7 AM|pg||
nt|mariner1: Pacific|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: sorry about that, but I assumed a claim was forthcoming and it wasn't|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|jallerton: I suppose you couldn't really insist that they claim|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jallerton: even though the players had enough information to do so|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe offer a bribe? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I wanted to (after the last trump was drawn)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzwa: they played 3 more tricks after that though (2 diamonds from dummy and a club)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|vugraphzwa: tricky hand for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Getting overboard .  N will double|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'd prefer to be in 3NT N/S than E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: trickless, although tricky|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: after thinking for so long, if he passes, it will be tough for South to lead a heart|pg||
nt|jallerton: Will anybody run?  |pg||
nt|jallerton: Perhaps East is the one thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he really dbl and should he|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes and yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: North & East on same side of screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: not if it goes all pass, then North is marked as the thinker|pg||
nt|marlowepi: USA need a big win, and this is a great opportunity for a lot of IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: if he doubles, then the heart lead is expected anyway (by my lights at least)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jallerton: North knows the cards are sitting badly so to even think of passing would be poor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am certain the double came quickly and it is E who thought|pg||
nt|mariner1: all dbls from here|pg||
nt|jallerton: East was the one thinking, as I suspected|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: E thinking about 4@S now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D first:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: or about not getting out of bed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: or redouble to keep @d in the picture|pg||
nt|mariner1: run up the line :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: N forgot to lead a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: my fault, folks|pg||
mc|8|nt|marlowepi: even so, heart seems obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Robinson had 3 diamonds, and South cashed the @dA rather than leading low|pg||

nt|mariner1: well @H and @D plays better|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: It's popular in USA to play double as both minors but this hand illustrates why it's better to play it has any 2 strains|pg||
