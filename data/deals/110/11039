nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good thing that the other table started already, might be slow there (the bauke muller factor :))|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best of starts for the Dutch, playing the 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: muller-de wijs played in 2@s in the 3-3 fit in the cr|pg||
nt|jeanhari: will probably cost exactly one imp|pg||
nt|danilo1: just cause they stared to fast :)  ...  -3 is not so tagic .. idf EW makes 3@H (140) :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: but ... will West enter biding after ev .. 1@D/@C -1NT ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: may be double score|pg||

nt|jeanhari: @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: normal spot of 1NT by NS|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to me was safer to overcall 1NT than balance with double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but Kit has gone low on both turns|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H not yet made on a spade lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: sure :) .. well, when no 1NT, also no Dble ... |pg||
nt|jeanhari: or switch|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: needs spade switch now|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Hello, Linda, gad, and specs. Welcome back to VG, where USA1 will try to lift itself out of the hole they have dug. Not that NL is a team you want to play when you are in this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: position|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

mb|3C|mb|d!|an|3 cards !s|nt|lml: I think I would have just overcalled on the South hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on the double, as spade bids could make it uncomfortable to show your hearts and shaope and strength. i prefer 1NT or 1H|pg||
nt|lml: we agree :)|pg||
nt|lml: I like bidding hearts when I have them|pg||
nt|lml: AKQxxx|pg||
nt|viren169: S is intending to bid hearts at his next turn to show a good hand...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that is better than bidding them when you dont|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I know he planned to bid hearts later as he did|pg||
nt|lml: but I think the overcall is better|pg||
nt|lml: I dont like doubling and bidding my suit unless I have a huge hand.  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: The problem is that partner does tend to jump around in the other major thinking I have a normal double|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|viren169: even 3@H goes down on a diamond lead...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|viren169: no!|pg||

nt|viren169: ...8...|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|imp_jan: 7H! nice save|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 7@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but 6@s has to be played with great care|pg||
nt|danilo1: cause single @C ... ev @S lead (or even @H & @H) ... may make 6@S not so cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we shall see, bidding only 4@H allows you to judge better whether to sac than a higher preempt (in my view)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|tarekr:  this might become a push now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: DeWIjs not choosing the best way in 7@H, unlucky though, will be 1400 I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well south has painted 0 defense, as occured in USA2, where sac was taken|pg||
nt|danilo1: I doubt North will bid 7@H ... 4 trumps even if 2345 are ... 4 trumps|pg||
nt|imp_jan: heart-heart|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... bwsides, he has ... @D Queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the sac is right surely unless you are afraid they will bid seven over it|pg||
nt|jeanhari: choosing another line it coud have been 800 in 7@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: sac is too risky ... if 6@S is on , probably min - is 1100 ... so 8 Hcp .. how big loss is if 6@S not on  ..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead clearly indicated versus 7@H, and likely yields 1100|pg||
pc|hK|nt|imp_jan: wow usa has 1400 on the bank|pg||
nt|dburn: may not be enough|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|dburn: though not obvious to make 6@s if the defence plays a second heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he will go down i think going for the crossruff|pg||
nt|danilo1: lets just try to apply Vernes (theory of total tricks) ... assuming pd ha 5 @H ... ops 9 @S ... 19 totals ... if 6@S on, 7@H is too much down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meckwell escaped down 800 in 7@H, some Gib viewers will know the par result|pg||

mc|11|nt|jeanhari: unlucky but a well deserved victory for USA 1|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well may be he cld have made it on a trump coup, bujt tat is dbl dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator, Jeanne Carbonneaux, good work|pg||
nt|jeanhari: tx all|pg||
nt|tarekr:  thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: thanks all|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, there was|pg||
nt|danilo1: Great set by USA1 .. unf. probably to late|pg||
nt|joest: she didn't seem so babbly or opinionated when I worked with her last time.  Of course it is possible I tuned her out. :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: tx all cu later|pg||
nt|poussin: bravo jeanne|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: next match in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|danilo1: Thanks all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also to Jan, Jean and all the spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next match in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: jessie ;)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry, Jessie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the defense to 7H, lead trumps, if declarer leads clubs, force dummy with spade for 1100 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: sounds like something out of Adventures in Card Play actually|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lml: quite a pretty one |pg||
mb|5H|nt|viren169: how high will South prempt? |pg||
nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
nt|lml: initeresting choice|pg||
nt|lml: puts it to you|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lml: East may well bid 6@S now|pg||
nt|lml: all he did so far was bid 1@S|pg||
nt|viren169: East will bid 6@C|pg||
nt|reisig: He'll bid|pg||
nt|viren169: still looking for 7!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good bid. W is nearly certain to have a spade raise in him, so you dont want to let him do it at the game level|pg||
nt|lml: North South have a decent save in 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the downside of course is that sometimes u push them to a slam they might not otherwsie biod. because when W DOES have enough to bid 5S, E will like the sound of that|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: spec notes Meckstroth saved at 7H|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6@S is enough ffrom West|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd believe them..and save|pg||
mb|d!|mb|6S|nt|viren169: not much of a save on a sure trump lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: down 800. opps only bid 4S though (just kidding about last part:))|pg||
nt|viren169: could be here for a long time...|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|viren169: dble?!?!|pg||
nt|viren169: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unpenalty slam double? :)|pg||
mb|7H|mb|d|nt|lml: the undoubel worked|pg||
nt|reisig: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: excellent!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: i'd rather go plus against 6S|pg||
nt|viren169: dble was=I want to bid on pd... (thks specs)|pg||
nt|lml: me too but I dont think you will|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: 6@S is laydown!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really?|pg||
nt|lml: it is indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: ruff diamond and use trump to cross ... ruff over north to draw trump|pg||
nt|lml: overruff|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 rounds of hearts is suggested in 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: you ruff|pg||
nt|lml: then you cash the @DA|pg||
nt|lml: then you cross on a spade|pg||
nt|lml: then you ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: then you cross on a spade|pg||
nt|lml: then you run diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: when north ruffs you overruff|pg||
nt|lml: and you have a trump entry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 6@S will have probably taken a while to play!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: bu t how would declarer actually play? after 2 rounds of hearts? if clubs are not 6-1 he is laydown via a crossruf. |pg||
nt|lml: I would play a trump to dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you are in dummy alredy|pg||
nt|lml: I have to cash the @DA anyway|pg||
nt|lml: no matter what line I cash the @DA and cross to dummy on trump|pg||
nt|viren169: best to cash the @D first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you mean cash a trump in dummy you are down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it matters|pg||
nt|lml: I have already said the line once |pg||
nt|viren169: once may not be enough!|pg||
nt|lml: it cant hurt to try diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: you have to ruff them anyway in a crossruff|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it matters a lot how declarer plays. main point is that the hand is not "laydown". you have to unblock D ace before even a single round of trumps. and even then the winning ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: line works ONLY because Ds are 33. meanwhile there is a complete crossruff for a TRULY laydown 12 tricks as long as clubs are not 6-1. i think the losing line is far better ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: statistically|pg||
nt|lml: generally 6@s made even on a heart lead but some occasionally went down.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: and i think it isnt close, and so i think many top declarers would go down unluckily|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pc|hK|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: they didnt|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|lml: on the actual board|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe the defense slipped up somehow|pg||
nt|viren169: do they get into the 'Unlucky Expert' club then?|pg||
nt|udo: ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless of course the declarer can see opp's hand, which is also not unheard of even at these top echelons|pg||
mc|7|nt|udo: sy|pg||
nt|lml: you dont necessarily need a 3-3 diamond break Qx is enough|pg||
nt|viren169: -1400 is not a thing of beauty!|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks all... especially the helpful specs!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK, that may be right, but it is still a considerably lower probablity than clubs not 6-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: OK, see you in a while. Vugraph out|pg||
