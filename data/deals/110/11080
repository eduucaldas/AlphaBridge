mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|howiew: North looking at a strong 1N opener opposites partner's mini 1N, will try for penalties at this vul.|pg||
nt|howiew: or not.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT15-17 - NS play 2/1 GF, pretty standard, 1st seat fav 1Nt 9-12, they have abandoned the Multi Twos they used to play. |pg||
nt|kit: North must have gotten confused about the 2@D call and thought it was forcing -- otherwise his pass makes not much sense|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|howiew: North apparently took the chance of a major suit correction to be followed by a card showing double.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: this could have been a digit for NS|pg||
nt|kit: this could well be down about 4, coming close to the value of the non-vul game|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|barnets: north will be feeling slightly foolish now|pg||

nt|bigtrain: most play X of natural bids as takeout...  X's of artificial bids as cards|pg||
nt|barnets: normal 3N in open bid n/s|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

nt|howiew: If 4D shows diamonds, N-S are in good shape in the auction.|pg||
nt|petergill: North is relaying, South has shown 4=3=6=0 and 14+|pg||
nt|howiew: apparently it showed the 4-3-6-0.  Now north may pull in his reins too mcuh.|pg||
mb|p|nt|howiew: They still rate to get to slam, but it may be very hard to reach the grand from here.|pg||
nt|petergill: We confirm that this match will of course be one of the matches on BBO for the next 16 board segment which starts in 105 minutes. |pg||
nt|kit: it would be hard to imagine any decent pair not getting to some slam|pg||
nt|howiew: One problem with relays such as this, is you find out shape, but both hands are unclear about strengths.  Here south has shown 14+, but I don;t know what else either knows about ...|pg||
nt|howiew: the other hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@H = RKCB for @D |pg||
mb|4N!|an|opt diamonds|mb|p|mb|6C!|an|3 KC and Q and good hand|mb|p|nt|howiew: All 11 N-S calls have been highlighted.|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps my Dutch adviser got it wrong - he did win the Spingold the other day, but he's not perfect. |pg||
nt|manado_1: pulsa 0,sekian soalnya..:)|pg||
nt|kit: North has easy 7NT bid with that knowledge -- he can count 6 diamonds, 4 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 spade|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT was RKCB for @D and 6@C = 3 keycards plus @DQ - the long pause might have been North trying to remember what the system is. |pg||
nt|howiew: He can hope for 6 diamonds.|pg||
nt|kit: if the 6@C bid shows 3 aces and diamond queen, as we have been told|pg||
nt|howiew: As Kit says, it seems 7N is at worst on a 3-2 diamond split from North's perspective.|pg||
nt|kit: I think South showed 6-card suit in response to the relays, but maybe not|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT was Optional RKCB for @D, with special responses|pg||
nt|barnets: in 7@D south would have an extra chance on a club lead he could ruff in hand Cash@SA 1DA @D K and then cash 3 high clubs pitcing spades ruff a spade cash 3  hearts ending in dummy ...|pg||
nt|barnets: and make last2 diamonds making if east was 2-3-4-4 with west the j or 10 of diam|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 6 @D's|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT showed 14+|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D showed 3 hearts, hence 4360|pg||
nt|howiew: I don't think 6@C was in Kantar's new blackwood book.|pg||
nt|kit: so maybe North is trying to choose between 7@D and 7NT, with possible trump coup in 7@D vs. just plain 13 winners in 7NT|pg||
nt|daman: that sounds reasonable Kit|pg||
nt|petergill: Optional RKCB in Netherlands is that step 1 = not keen on slam , others = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: Since it is impossible to decide, he might as well bid 7NT and take the 2 extra IMPs when both make, as is likely.|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|howiew: sometimes it is just right to take the two imps.|pg||
nt|petergill: My source is Spingold winner Jan Jansma, he predicted 7NT as the final destination. |pg||
nt|howiew: This is where it would be quite nice for us to let the viewgraph operator claim and get onto the next hand.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Over 4NT , 5@C would be no interest in slam, others = keycard responses, 6@C being 3 keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: lol|pg||
nt|petergill: So North knew South had Axxx, Axx, AQxxxx, void with perhaps another card somewhere|pg||
nt|kit: unless the viewgraph operator misclaims, as we all do on occasion|pg||
nt|howiew: Very nicely bid hand.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer examining various squeezes on the assumption that diamonds aren't splitting|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: he asked about lead|pg||
