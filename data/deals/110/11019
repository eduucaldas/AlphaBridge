nt|buffytvs: I'm a little surprised Stewart accepted the invite -- not much extra and not vulnrable, with a doubelton in his partner's suit|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the hearts are friendly, so all will be well -- spades break too|pg||
nt|andyv:  sluff ruff may be the best D|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- really need to attack the entries, which are trumps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: he heard you Andy :)|pg||
nt|ybob: ruff in hand, 2 rounds @S with AQ and @H to K and ruff @H  ? |pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, that works|pg||
nt|andyv:  better not if they want any chance for that 8th spot!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or ruff in dummy and finesse @Dq|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the OR did not bid the game, so potential pickup for USA1 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  might even just ruff @h high, play two rounds of trump and run @hs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: both same i think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: unless after high ruff he plans to run @S9 ..|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Stewart and Woolsey are both 'thoughtful' players -- don't expect any speed records to be broken here|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding this game may be more of result of where USA1 stands rather than bridge logic.  They need to blitz to have any chances.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: to cater for j10xx with east|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that will not work|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  last possibility... pull trump (if 3-2) and give up @h|pg||

nt|cicus: I think he still makes then|pg||
nt|mariner1: lots of ways to play and most work|pg||

nt|ady: a low heart to the queen gives best chance to go down|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay|pg||
nt|cicus: well a small heart makes it tough, E wins, leads a club, west leads a @D and now declarer has only 2 trumps and has to crossruff to make|pg||

nt|buffytvs: Linda :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but a @C singleton or @Ck is good for east|pg||

pc|d2|nt|andyv:  with such soft values, hard to fault East for not bidding 4@d but that would have done it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S seems to have a very variable NT opening|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: i think i saw a 15-17 vul NT sometime back|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N seems like a mp bid here... with that vul, a good 5 card suit and 9hcp, 3N seems reasonable|pg||
