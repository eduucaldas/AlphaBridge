mb|4H|nt|kareno: 6@d was a little rich for me too!!  But once south opens, north can be almost forgiven.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive 3@S cause else N would have used a relay. But waited for the @D slam try|pg||

nt|vugraphzwc: director called|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But a swing to Germany|pg||
nt|kareno: The 3@h bid may have propelled e/w into game - wasn't made in the CR and game wasn't bid e/w.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: tempo issue|pg||
nt|kareno: By whom?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I assume West|pg||
nt|kareno: hm.  Only possible violator but did she actually hesitate overlong?  |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It didn't seem long to me but may have been noticeable|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it is with screens so it would have to be very long - perhaps south considered her bid a while also.|pg||
