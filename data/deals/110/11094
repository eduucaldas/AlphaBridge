nt|tomi2: CR bid the slam|pg||
nt|MolvaM: smirnov will be pleased to hear about that splinter|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but what to bid?|pg||
nt|danilo1: however slam try, I do not like 4@D .. why not start with Dble when alread chance (saving space) .. they could score almost slam in 3@D Dbled (800)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no @s cue and 5@c would be exaggerating a bit|pg||
nt|tomi2: he will not know how serious this spinter was. depending on, waht 2NT was, 4@D could show only strnght to game/double them but not to slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|danilo1: than one more reason for Dble and not 4@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: their 1@H opening is limited to bad 18 so 1@H-2@H sequences seldom lead to slams|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: did North bid @D in CR too?|pg||
