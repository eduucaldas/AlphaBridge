nt|odysseus69: Harper- Hackett also played the first set. The plan seems to be for them to play their quota early and leave the rest to the front-line 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland special here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: NO JUST SHOWING A GOOD RAISE|pg||
nt|lestergold: Paul using the old fashioned but excellent convention to show good raise in dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviouly playing  fairly natural system|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: having volunteered 1S on hand 1 East is more prudent here-comung in now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have bid as east|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but if West doubles again we can expect 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may double again|pg||
nt|odysseus69: passing then coming in sounds weaker so better|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s was called for over 2N as a two way bid either makes if pard strong or disrupts opps |pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: wromg colours to bounce|pg||

nt|lestergold: price and simpson dealt rather summarily with e/w cards in closed as one should at these colours|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: red card pls paul|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard vul to get excited with Ross' 11 count including qj clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: or 5@D fielders choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: he doesnt know that qj clubs is enormous here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: hmmmmm ross so a push probably|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  It's hard for N/S to do more|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: swopping the club ace for heart king and 4S is cold - needs 2 out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|roswolf: unconvinced im afraid when north shows a chunky raise it has both offrnce and defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: on another day 4s would be cold and 5d going for a fair number just change the position of a few key cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- moving the club ace and heart king|pg||
nt|lestergold: this auction and the result is absolutely normal on the cards that the players can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: except that e/w shoudl have got their more quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: if the key cards are swopped bidding is likely to be very different|pg||
nt|odysseus69: essentially it is a 25% game|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: I think this hand will often be played in 4s undoubled more often than not|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down and 2imps back for Egypt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 2 down if he runs this|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The 8@h doesn't indicate any holding where he can make|pg||

nt|roswolf: 6@D is very fortuitous because of the @S position|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the sort of slam that could well be punted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: 5@H seems a good save, 500 if they find the @C ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes quite often you can't know that partner has three small cards opposite your AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nigel_k:  So you just hope he has something else|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: east will not need much encouragement with dim support and finding his pard with an ace, natural to take a chance of no spade losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6H is good save - 800 with club ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he would be luckily right too|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhileross and paul have done their favourable vul trouble making|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: would you as west raise 5@D to 6?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|odysseus69: not me- when partner is bounced I miss my slams- |pg||
nt|lestergold: probably on the closed room auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be interesting if west bids 5@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5S is ok with me|pg||
mb|5S|nt|roswolf: AND THEN EAST SHOULD BID THE SLAM IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5S if pard can bid 4s all on his own i would assume so|pg||
