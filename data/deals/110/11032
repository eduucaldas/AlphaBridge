mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: of the six European Teams entered, 5 are in the top 8|pg||
nt|athene: standard methods for NS; 15-17 NT, 5-card majors|pg||
nt|athene: EW play Kaplan-Sheinwold (weak NT 5-majors)|pg||
nt|xenya: impressive, Cliff|pg||
nt|capercliff: and Germany are currently sitting 9th|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|shurik:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|capercliff: for running scores http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=782&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|capercliff: USA 1 have had an uphill battle after starting poorly|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's main decision on this hand is whether to ruff two spades in hand|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that even if one is overruffed it might be from four trumps anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: this would have been interesting at MP -- overtricks are possible|pg||
nt|athene: well, the clubs lie nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: so there's no danger whichever line is chosen|pg||
nt|shurik:  yep i think he is more worried about 10 tricks Volodya|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: @SK, @SA, spade ruff to start with, i think|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|h7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer played a club up from dummy early he could make 12|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: now W can be squeezed |pg||
nt|athene: he can ruff just one spade and then run trumps to squeeze west in the black suits|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|hK|nt|athene: ok this is a nice line, eloping with diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing the fourth spade high establishes a trump trick for east but declarer gets it back by making dummy's small trumps with diamond ruffs|pg||

nt|athene: both black suits doing their best to get into declarer's good books|pg||

mb|1C|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: possibly 4@H for EW here|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|nt|athene: east can double for t/o here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: think they'll get there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but west has the most he can have and not overcall 1@H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|athene: hard for east to proceed|pg||
nt|capercliff: im surprised N didnt bid some number of @c's, can 1@c be short?|pg||
nt|athene: ok 3@C actually helps east describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west should bid 4@H over the second double i think|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|athene: perhaps it's a bit pushy|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H has issues|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: 10 now|pg||
nt|athene: many ways to play this heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: a very common combination|pg||
nt|athene: 8-card fit missing KJ|pg||
nt|athene: you can take finesses either way|pg||
nt|capercliff: running the Q is % no?|pg||
nt|athene: here there's also the issue of dummy being forced, and problems with entries to dummy |pg||
nt|tarekr:  well N did bid 1NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: although the 1N bid might sway that somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: i think he is intending to put in the @H9 if north plays low|pg||
nt|shurik:  North did his best by stopping them from 4 h- club lead can he still make though?|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie there's no worries|pg||
nt|athene: the problem, always, on hands of this type|pg||
nt|athene: is how to keep control of your weak suit (clubs here)|pg||
nt|athene: whilst getting trumps drawn|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|athene: or at least enough trumps that you can run your side-suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tarekr:  He did get a friendly lead|pg||
nt|athene: you want to lose a trump trick early whilst dummy has length to control clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  as specs point out, makeable doesn't mean it will be made... play of @h suit will be key if they reach that spot....but unlikely|pg||

mb|4D!|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: not sure quite how you make 12|pg||
nt|athene: they got a diamond lead, @DQ, @DA, ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: so you can lead the @DJ throwing a spade|pg||
nt|capercliff: im trying to work that out myself:)|pg||
nt|shurik:  but they are moving there- if 4dia shows void then 6h have great chance unless pd has 9 points:>|pg||
nt|athene: but you still lose the @DK and a club|pg||
nt|tarekr:  thinking about 5@d|pg||
nt|athene: @DK lead indeed concedes 12 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: it also concedes a fair amount of prestige|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|tarekr:  People play that the @d of shortness NV vs V suggests a sacrifice|pg||
nt|capercliff: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D presumably promises specifically a void|pg||
nt|tarekr:  that the Dbl of shortness|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think you are right Bill, singeltons would go through 3@c first|pg||
nt|xenya: do we agree with S's double (assuming 4@D was a splinter)?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|shurik:  5dia dbled around 500- now west has to bid??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tarekr:  yes |pg||
nt|athene: in "traditional" Jacoby 2NT, east would bid 3@D, showing singleton or void, but most good pairs play a better scheme these days|pg||
nt|athene: firstly, you should be able to differentiate between singleton and void|pg||
nt|athene: because they aren't the same|pg||
nt|athene: secondly you should use lower-level responses for a wider range of hands|pg||
nt|capercliff: this will not make|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 4@D did show a void|pg||
nt|athene: and the high-level bids for sending very specific messages|pg||
nt|shurik:  i think 5h overstatement- unless it shows weak opening hand|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure 4@D showed a void|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Well it is a choice: The other way 4@d would have shown another 5 cd suit with 2/3 top honors|pg||
nt|capercliff: *commentators curse?|pg||
nt|shurik:  if 4dia shows void- why bid 5h?|pg||
nt|athene: trump or spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: notice the other room did not see slam possible and simply rose to 4@h's|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Doug bid his hand 2+1 times|pg||
nt|capercliff: now it is impossible to find the @d sack|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D a little too high for south to make a support double|pg||
nt|athene: i think he will bid 4@S now, though|pg||
nt|athene: very close|pg||
nt|capercliff: doesnt want to miss a VUL game|pg||

nt|athene: if you take an eon, they are more likely to double you, if things lie poorly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S makes because the defence can't knock out both red aces|pg||
