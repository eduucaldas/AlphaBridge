nt|lestergold: west on lead this has good chances|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead helps defense|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: best lead found|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if you know to find @CJ you make 3nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@H is 2nd high which I never have liked|pg||
nt|lestergold: most logical lead on bidding |pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like it from an honour card that is for sure|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @H J lead would have been inspired|pg||
nt|mariner1: here it is clear to N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote for making and you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the issue here is can the defence come to 3hearts a diamond and a club beofre declarer can get at 4 clubs a heart 3 spades and a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: he is down now I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: the defence need to get their carding and timing right|pg||

nt|mariner1: he may miss guess @c now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: no the club guess hes home|pg||
nt|lestergold: north needed to switch to a dim at trick 2 to create problems for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: will be believe S only had weak @D suit and nothing else?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @CQ and after 2@H lost and @DA and @SQAK he is home|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he mite think @CA with S|pg||
nt|mariner1: so u think its clear where the AJ @c are?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: if north switches to diamond only winning play for dclarer is to rise with ace and play club toq defence will then get 2 dims a club  and a heart otherwise if declarer ducks ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamond switch back to hearts will defeat|pg||
