pc|cT|nt|pbundy: strange; this is the spade holding for which zia was hoping when defending 3NT|pg||

nt|jallerton: The conv card doesn't say anything about 4th seat openings, but a Multi might have been available for a min with 6 hearts|pg||

nt|daman: 2NT is a standard call|pg||

nt|dinos1: play 2@h on xxxxxx opp x? instead of on @d4-4?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 2H with W hand you will miss vul games, a style which is not in the Meckwell toolkit. 2N by W was just normal|pg||
