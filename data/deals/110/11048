nt|daman: South will start with a canape 1@D|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1N|nt|daman: canape is where the second suit you bid is always longer than the first suit|pg||
nt|flash: some would play that a 2@C call from the North hand now would be showing the majors|pg||
nt|daman: I play 2@D as showing that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: longer or sometimes equal, when 55 you bid lower,higher then lower if given the chance|pg||
nt|flash: which would restrict North's ability to intervene|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: doh|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S should be 5-card suit, as well|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lc: Presumably 5NT was pick-a-slam, but it looks as if he gave up too early on 7.|pg||
nt|daman: I think they will bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|flash: 4@C control bid?|pg||
nt|daman: looks like it|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably 4@C does agree@S and show @C control.|pg||
nt|lc: Now, if 4NT is RKC for @S, they should be on their way -- but it is always scary in these auctions if 4NT might be natural/quant.|pg||
nt|flash: 4@H appears to be coming next?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see how Kirr will ever be able to count 13 tricks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|flash: and to use b'wood with Qx in an outside suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: if 4@C cue, South should have enough to use RKC -- then all Keycards and King ask.. etc.|pg||
nt|daman: they could be in Neverneverland here|pg||
nt|lc: Can't be off @DAK if 1NT is 15-17.|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|lc: Have at least 34 HCP from South's point of view.|pg||
nt|flash: fair enuf  :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lc: Normally, don't Blackwood off an AK in one suit -- but here it would have been safe.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|lc: So, now they seem firmly in Blackwood mode.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Just a question of how North shows kings.|pg||
nt|daman: Easley has been unsheathed|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lc: Roman Easley :)|pg||
nt|flash: and (if they're using specific Kings), the @CK is just what's needed|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|lc: 3@C showed 5 cards South can already picture 13 tricks if one other king with North.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 4@D paid dividends by finding heart king in advance of Blackwood|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: well done - 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: in gin  they call the @C King an "elbow card"  it fits the hand so well you push it in with your elbow    very distressing to your opp :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lc: Well done (although 7NT is better than 7@S since will often survive bad ! break).|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: nicely done guys|pg||
nt|lc: If @S misbehave, 7NT might still make.|pg||
nt|lc: But, South had no way to know about North's @CJ.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: And, once N-S push opps to 3 level -- let it go.|pg||
nt|lc: On a typical partscore battle such as this, the goal is to push opps to 3-level.|pg||

nt|lc: I agree!|pg||

nt|lc: No endplays, no squeezes, no potential defensive lapses -- just plain down 1.|pg||

nt|lc: Then, how will North treat his hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Possible to open 1@H, or 2@C rebidding either @H or 2NT.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: as an additional note, should both USA teams advance to the KO phase, they must meet no later than the semi-finals|pg||

nt|daman: np :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both 1@C and 1@D are multi meaning openings|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1@H and 1@S are strictly canape openings, either 6 card suit or longer side suit|pg||

nt|daman: Arno will cuebid now|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the details i don't know, but here seems to have turned into a strong 1@C auction|pg||

nt|lc: This is one of those deals where "Deep Finesse" or "Gib" will probably say slam is cold.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, those programs are looking at all 52 cards.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 2 bids are intermediate, somewhat like in Fantunes system|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: I'd like to be N-S at money bridge this match.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is the good contract|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|flash: Carruthers ended up on lead and not sure whether partner had an ace and, if so, which one...|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|flash: 1@H is either the equivalent of a forcing NT or natural|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: sorry - 0-7 over the 1@C opener|pg||
nt|lc: So, why do we think 3NT made? |pg||
nt|flash: the sideways action got me|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, West lead a top @S against 3NT.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C is for sure forcing, so looks to me 1@H is negative or hearts|pg||
nt|flash: Carruthers exited a @H after cashing his winners...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: Then, when he gets in with @HA and cashes @S, he should know which ace to play partner for.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Why should he know?  Well, East plays S.P. on all those high spades.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in Roman Club the 2@C rebid would announce the equivalent of a strong 2@C opening in standard|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I would burn a hole in the table as East by playing my spades from the top down -- HIGHEST SIDE SUIT PARTNER!|pg||
nt|flash: :)|pg||
nt|lc: Besides, doesn't South have to give the show away on the run of the spades?|pg||
nt|lc: What does South throw on the good spades so that West would not realize the importance of playing diamonds?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lc: Anyway, here, it is wrong-sided (wrong for Berk, anyway) -- so we won't get to see.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lc: THere are 2 theories at work here as to Berk's lead ...|pg||
nt|lc: 1) Prefer to lead majors over minors (because opps always would find a major if they had one).|pg||
nt|lc: or ...|pg||
nt|lc: 2) 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|lc: What kills you is to zig and zag.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: south has just about enough to look for slam|pg||
nt|lc: By the way, Gerstman-Passell is not a regular pair.  Far from it.|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that the worst possible qualification outcome for the two USA teams would be to have one of them finish 4th and the other finish somewhere in 5th-8th|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so maybe 4@C now but not sure if Stayman or natural|pg||
nt|daman: normally   gertsman/sutherlin|pg||
nt|lc: The USA2 team is sort of 3 pairs, but Passell ends up playing lots of extra matches (not just with Lynch, but taking turns with Sutherlin and Gerstman).|pg||
nt|flash: that would likely result in a qtr-final meeting, as opposed to the semi-final showdown we've come to expect|pg||

nt|flash: sit out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: BB argentina 28 netherlands 2|pg||
nt|lc: Well, my strategy would be to put the big@C pair in for the slams deals :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt this is an opener|pg||
nt|flash: the draw/ sequence of matches has been known for quite a while; line-ups have to be submitted just before play starts|pg||
nt|lc: Flash, are you there in Brazil, by any chance?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this system is most closely related to Roman, balanced minimum was 12 points|pg||
nt|flash: i see this as a first cousin to MPs in a weak field - you try to break even against the strong pairs (taking any gifts) and clean up against the weaker pairs|pg||
nt|lc: Absolutely.|pg||
nt|flash: no, sadly - it took great effort for us to avoid going...|pg||
nt|lc: That is why the "Butler rankings" -- which IMPs each pair's results and are published .. are misleading.|pg||
nt|lc: When you sit out against the weak countries, your "rating" suffers.|pg||
nt|daman: BB    Mexico 29   Norway 8|pg||
nt|flash: any match against a strong team which yields a margin like this is a windfall for the winner and rather disastrous for the loser|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely though if all three pairs are roughly equal in strength, you end up playing a mix of good and bad teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: ok, continue now|pg||
nt|daman: I am told on this hand....Indonesia was in 5@C doubled   making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Looks normal to play 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: if all three pairs are roughly equivalent, you're most likely just to use a fixed rotation - with each pair getting one match off each day|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C opening?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2D|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|lc: I love 2@D -- and knew Berk would do it.|pg||
nt|lc: Opp passed hand, you can have very wide range -- no fear of missing game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, not sure how this works since 2@C rebid by Hobart is the strong hand|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lc: I forgot to study the N-S system notes -- should have been a prerequesite to commentate on this match.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: ANyway, they have landed in the noraml contract.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Hobart could have bid 3@H also, since with 4 hearts would have opened that suit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lc: If playing "Rosenkranz" redoubles, West has denied a top @D.  With a top @D he would have XX over South's Double.|pg||

nt|lc: yes...|pg||
nt|flash: given the odds of not having to play against a particular pair during the round-robin, how likely is it that anyone will actually read up in advance of a match?|pg||
nt|lc: Good question...|pg||
nt|lc: My policy was ...|pg||
nt|lc: During Round Robin, just study about 5-10 minutes before the match.|pg||

nt|mcphee: bye bye 3N|pg||
nt|lc: So, can they cope in 4@S with the 5-0 break?  I doubt it.|pg||
nt|mcphee: yeah I guess not|pg||
nt|mcphee: even 4-1 this hand would not be good|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably, 3@S by North directly would have shown 5@S, invitational.  By puppeting first, he shows 4 invitational.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: at least, that is how I play it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lc: So, opposite 4@S invitational, with the @CQ now wasted (likely), maybe South could have passed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lc: Fun hand to lead from for Berk -- lots of appealing choices.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
