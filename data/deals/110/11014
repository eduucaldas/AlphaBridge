nt|bobh1: 6@d not a terrible contract but doomed here|pg||
nt|xenya: any lead beats 6@D i think|pg||
nt|jallerton: with North having a singleton @d, yes|pg||
nt|lady007: according to GIB even 5@d is going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@d usually makes if @ds 2-2 |pg||
nt|jallerton: singleton @c I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they're 3-1 you run out of winners|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even 5@d may be off on this layout|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT is the sure game|pg||
nt|jallerton: So East is right to be thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course opener's hand is really bad so E has to pull in his horns|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a lovely hand opposite W's shape|pg||
nt|jallerton: East can bid 3@h as a weak relay according to our systems expert|pg||
nt|lady007: east must be very worried about the diamond and club loser but he doesnt know they have 8 top tricks in 3nt|pg||
nt|lady007: change wests club and spade holding and 3nt doesnt look so great anymore|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course even though W's hand is bad for an opener, the lack of wastage in @ss is good on this auction|pg||
nt|jallerton: though 5@d might also be in trouble on a @h lead on that layout. Marion|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but you may be able to set up the spade suit if the ace is onside|pg||
nt|lady007: for 3 club discards|pg||
nt|bobh1: for E, this may be a case of "the man who knew too much"|pg||
nt|lady007: and the opponents have no clue at all to lead a heart or a club against 5@d and against 3nt they usually try their longest suit (which is more likely to be hearts in mullers ...|pg||
nt|lady007: perspective)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lady007: the problem with these GF relays is that you get to know the shape but in this case that doesnt help very much as you need to know where your partners points are|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h weak relay, 3@s minimum, I think|pg||
nt|lady007: if de wijs had shown a singleton somewhere it would have been a lot easier, of course|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, min|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you play these relays, Marion?|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007: but on this hand i would respond 2@d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d pn way to sign-off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: so in the end E tried hard and then left his partner an out|pg||
nt|lady007: because of this problem, we tend not to use it on unbalanced hands with a good other suit unless we are (very) strong|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong club; there's not much point in playing strong @c if you don't open the West hand|pg||
nt|lady007: do they always have to bid 1N on GF hands?|pg||
nt|jallerton: He seems to be in trouble if N has 2 trumps left|pg||
