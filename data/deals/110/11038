nt|sommer: you have to use @D as sparetrumps, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: In the open room declarer knew that a cross-ruff would not work|pg||
nt|Walddk1: North overtook @HQ and switched to a club|pg||

nt|Walddk1: That must be a singleton for sure|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|ralfwil: Use @d as extra trump will work|pg||
