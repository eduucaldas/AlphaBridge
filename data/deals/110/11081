mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|danilo1: 7@C?|pg||
nt|danilo1: or 6@S with @H lead?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is "Baltic", thats a ploish club style but also allowes 11-14 natural. (and 21-22 bal are excluded)... so its either ballanced 12-14, 18-20 or 23+ OR natural like here ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: (unlimited) or any other 18+ hcp hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is a very difficult hand|pg||

nt|danilo1: this may break German pait in CR ... there Bulgarians recovered bad board|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|mcarroll: Yes Remarkable|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: West fooled the defense when he played @CQ covered to the ace and @C5 (the highes outstanding spot)|pg||
mb|p!|an|1/2 stoper|nt|tomi2: Elinescu was not awake and did not ruff this, so a @H could be pitched|pg||

nt|danilo1: hope it is not South who is thinking|pg||
nt|tomi2: S and W are on same side of the screen, guess both bids will be shown when the tray is over|pg||
nt|tomi2: Problem for Smirnov is now that Piekarek never really confirmed he has real spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: ok guys... director was here e he ask to stop the bidding for a moment. I still dont know why... we are waiting for him...|pg||
nt|danilo1: upleasynt for West ... would like to bid 6@C ... but KQ may be only 2 loosers ... I would not be schocked with 6@S here too ... A is Ace and partner bid at least 6 of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S is systematicly RKCB in clubs when @C are set - and this auction looks so|pg||
nt|danilo1: why 4@S cannot be natural, as well as 4@C?|pg||
nt|tomi2: because Piekarek refused to bid spades instead of 3@D and insteaod of redouble|pg||
nt|danilo1: note that 4@C was forced bid (West could not pass Rdble)|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think redouble invited Smrnov to bid 3NT|pg||
