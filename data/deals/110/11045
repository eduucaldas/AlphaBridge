nt|sybarra: every imp counts now (as always really) but this and 3 rounds to go |pg||
nt|ady: grand here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: 7@h is pretty good if you aren't forced to guess what to do in diamonds at trick one|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid it on the finesse? |pg||
nt|joest: you can test spades w/o a diamond lead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: 1NT = 10-12|pg||
nt|ady: very good grand played by east  as option of 4 spade tricks  or diamond finesse|pg||
nt|dinos1: weak NT NV|pg||
nt|joest: sometimes there isn't a ton of great slam machinery opposite mini-NTs|pg||
nt|dinos1: mini-NT :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and do they get to the slam....|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my question |pg||
nt|joest: they bid the small in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: easier now with super accept |pg||
nt|sybarra: may just blast |pg||
nt|joest: Even if West could locate the diamond ace (via Exclusion Blackwood for example), he stilldoesn't know what to do about his two small spades.  Thsi won|pg||
nt|joest: won't be easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: how much science can you employ?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S    4@D    may get them there|pg||
nt|joest: even at that, you don't know that east has a doubleton diamond witha pitch coming|pg||
nt|dinos1: for grand he needs @dAK @hQxxx and @sxx|pg||
nt|dinos1: or @dAKxx|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: i doubt the grand can be bid from this point without a throw of the dice in some material aspect|pg||
nt|dinos1: so no need in blasting|pg||
nt|joest: i would think 3@s might be preferable so partner doesn't worry about spades and to leave partne room to (unfortunately) cue the ace of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|dinos1: or 6@h?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no 4 @d? |pg||
nt|joest: 4@s ok assuming it is not some sort of RKCB exotica which, with some pairs, it would be|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends on agreement - W skipped @s cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe its exotica |pg||
nt|joest: yes both east and west are skipping over opportunities to cue bid controls they own|pg||
nt|dinos1: and E has no @s cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: then it is something else, skipping the cue bids|pg||
nt|joest: if I were East I'd be worried about spades.   If west had denied holding a spade control, cue bidding the ace of diamonds would promise I had a spade control!|pg||
nt|sybarra: think you are right Jack, Vlad, et all |pg||
nt|dinos1: if u cue 4@c then u MUST cue 4@s now (or bid 6)|pg||
nt|joest: but we are not (I am not) privy to their cue bidding understandings so this is speculation|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are why "system notes" are 200 pages |pg||
nt|sybarra: or so |pg||
nt|sybarra: W in the tank |pg||
nt|dinos1: but it's the only reason why E didnt cue @dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it is N |pg||
nt|joest: over a 3@h jump I think he owes his partner 4@s even if he is worried about @ds|pg||
nt|ady: I would have prefered 3@S to 4@C  over 3 hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: me2|pg||
nt|joest: at this point I would think seven is completely out of the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: uuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh|pg||
