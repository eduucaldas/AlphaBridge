nt|askgaard: Grand slam here. Hopefully they won't play this board equally fast :)|pg||
nt|benjent: A big loss could seriously dent either team's chances|pg||
nt|frm: Starting with a grand slam depending omn the spades to behave or a diamondfinesse|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right this is an important match for both teams.|pg||
nt|benjent: They have both have pretty tough draws coming home, playing 3 of the other 6 top teams|pg||
nt|askgaard: Denmark has a very tough program left for the remaining matches|pg||
nt|benjent: By the way, what do Germany and Denmark have in common? Apart from a border|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|an|min, 4!H|mb|p|nt|benjent: This is a good grand from East (protecting the @d holding). The Danes have done the first part...|pg||
nt|askgaard: Yes good start|pg||
mb|4C!|an|short|nt|benjent: They both have to play Australia!  That's about the only relevant part Australia has left to play in the tournament, so I'm going to cling to that :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: West has a very promising hand, but bidding the grand with any certainty is difficult.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: west has written that she will bid over 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|an|3 KC|nt|benjent: 4@c doesn't deny a @s cue - showing the shortage takes priority|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: that mean if the tray took a long time at the other side of the screen and a 4@H return, she is not bidding on unauthoried information|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|an|nothing more to show|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|benjent: Smart thing for Binderkan to do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: E-W don't play roman key card but show aces rather than ask for them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|askgaard: This is fair enough. They discovered that @dK was missing so the grand rated to be not good enough.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|benjent: Difficult for West to know about East's clubs, and East is also known to be minimum. Easy to construct a hand where 7@h isn't good|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|jeanhari: east wont be happy to cooperate...|pg||
mb|4C|an|shortness|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: but 4@D would be a welcome sound to west|pg||
nt|joefri: Good to know pard has 4@Hs, probably in a weak NT. But difficult to learn about 3rd Control @S, @D-A and possible @D-K now. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: always scary to splinter in partner's "suit"|pg||
nt|joefri: 4@D is all she wanted to hear, so they won't stop before 6@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: on off the things you will have duscussed on this level :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine getting past 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: relay bidders might be able to locate @SQ but still not a percentage grand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be good if played in east|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: spades 3-3+Jx is 52%, and you have the diamond finesse in reserve. Quite good. |pg||
nt|jeanhari: not in reserve after the lead|pg||
nt|joefri: Odds for Grand are 73.4671 % .... rough calculation until someone proves the opposite :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1/4 kc|nt|ahollan1: if 4@D always Ace then 4N is safe|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @S now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not going for 7 after one ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: could be Ace clubs and diamond king|pg||
mb|6H|nt|joefri: Open Room stopped in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right - depends if 4@D can be King|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: apparently it can - in which case I don't like 4N bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dare I say it would be old fashioned 4@D to show the ace?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: if absolutely Ace, then don't like 6@H -- still too many hands where 7@H cold|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no 4Nt is the easy way out, I guess she would have gambled 7 after 2 aces|pg||
nt|joefri: SHe should have bid 4@S to hear, whether pard bids 5@C (bad) 5@D (very good) or 5@H (nothing more to tell)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly right|pg||
nt|joefri: 4@D is just a control in their system, 1st or 2nd|pg||
nt|jeanhari: as there is nothing in the play we can keep on discussing the bidding :)|pg||
nt|werge: Do they play?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW do play Exclusion Key Card -- so that would have been option to consider|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d2|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|hA|pc|d8|pg||

nt|askgaard: Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: 1N is 15-17|pg||
nt|mug: most players would double 1@S on Bekkouche's hand, but I think there is a good case for passing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: if it goes all pass you will go plus, if you have a game on you will hear from partner|pg||
nt|benjent: Please make it :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mug: anyway 1NT is a good stop, many pairs will be in 4@H which will cost|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|askgaard: On this layout EW did well to stay so low.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|benjent: So consistent English pessimism :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Assuming the same shape, how much better would you have to be as West to balance?|pg||
nt|mug: just normal bridge, slow down when there is evidence of a misfit|pg||
nt|mug: I guess you reopen with about 17-19|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't disagree with you Tom, just interested in everyone's boundaries on a classic competitive problem|pg||

nt|askgaard: The @dAK are stranded, but NS will have to play something.|pg||
nt|mug: weak notrump is much harder to play than strong, you avoid these problems by opening 1NT|pg||
nt|frm: king of spades and another spade will ensure seven tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|benjent: The thing I think is hard is playing 4 card major with weak 1NT. EW play 4@h and 5@s, kinda half-half|pg||

nt|jeanhari: without the diamond control|pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|joefri: When I was young, I liked Blackwood. Nowadays I have bid so many Slams with intelligent cue-bidding and no Blackwood at all. This ace-asking-stuff is overrated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification -- i mean 5@C after 4@D|pg||
nt|joefri: This looks like a simple 4@S from EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point is that asking aces with void, or 2 loser suit --   aces doesn't tell what you need to know|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but blackwood is getting more sophisticated too, would not want play without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: bd 19 was skipped by the software. I'm trying to figure a way to get to it. This is not the board they are playing now.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok so we wait?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West has a 9+ HCP, 2+  1@C opener -- just like east on last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what happened to board 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: still being played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  i see Paulo's comment noe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: P-1NT-2@s-Dbl so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: on bd 19 (for those of you who can follow the cards in another screen)|pg||
nt|joefri: very low standard of opening ... don't like that in a natural system, because the span of HCP is to wide then|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: 3@d-P-3NT-all pass, 3NT by West there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room auction to 6@H much more convincing|pg||
nt|Zmud99: There's seems to be a bug at board 19 - sorry for this - we will wait for board 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: @s10 lead by North|pg||
nt|jeanhari: like a radio comment :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: this bug named "copacabana" bug is well know here and happened rarely...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can save yourself trouble Paulo -- since we don't know the hands|pg||
nt|joefri: Seems to be a bit too high, 3 NT. Open room is in 1NT EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow is last day of round robin   this and 3 more matches to determine 8 teams that advance to Knockout|pg||
nt|joefri: and they are talking about a way to ensure 7 tricks ... not 9 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: I'm seeing only declarer and dummy (so far), it doesn't look like a bad game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: but I don't know how the suits break ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: ah, I know now (just seen South's cards). Yes, it is a bad game :D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Germany currently 6th  Denmark 7th|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: declarer won trick 1 with the jack, ducked a heart to North, who played back another spade.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now a club to the 7 will work|pg||
nt|jeanhari: for some tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: declarer then ducked a 2nd heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: France, China, USA1 are top 3 with a lot of clearance till 4th spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: South came back with a diamond (@d2)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so now ns will make 6 tricks|pg||
nt|joefri: Back to board 18 (6@H+1): Italy bid 7@H against Pakistan, Indonesia against Argentina also and Egypt played 6@Hxx for 1820 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1820 -- i wonder if anybody knew that result without having to use fingers|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Good for Indonesia (and the dutch therefore :) )|pg||
nt|joefri: Venezuela missed the xx and scored only 1310, all other matches no swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Brazil also bid it against Pakistan|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 210 x4 + 100|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not that diff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just look at back of the bidding card :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: declarer won the diamond shift (pitching a spade from dummy) and ducked a 3rd heart, in the meantime on bd 19|pg||
nt|joefri: I only checked Ladies ... no ideea what Open teams did with Board 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: South then played the @c6, and West is thinking|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so decl will make 3s, 2H 2D and thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: ah, sorry, I'm following both brazilian teams|pg||
nt|jeanhari: did she|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now the 7 will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: @c6,7,Q,2|pg||
nt|joefri: So about 8 IMPs for Denmark in the invisible board 19|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no, north still a chance to pay diamonds back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: North can now establish spades with a club entry, though|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or diamonds|pg||
nt|joefri: Somebody tell a joke please so we don't loose our specs :)|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mug: so 3@C is rather dangerous, clubs could be the canape suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: 1@s is also limited, so it's going to be even tougher for them to imagine a slam with a passed hand opposite 10-15|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|benjent: The @cK was hardly a juicy card. Not entirely sure of their methods, but I think North should have ventured 2@d instead of 1NT, since she was a passed hand|pg||

mb|1H!|an|4+!H or any INV|nt|frm: Seems like a normal 3 NT|pg||

nt|askgaard: Auken's 1NT shows a hand too *strong* for a 1NT opening...|pg||
nt|askgaard: so 13-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|frm: And so it will be. Theres no ecxuse for going beyond 3 NT!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: 6N is makeable|pg||
nt|benjent: Might get a quant 4NT passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: thanks to the fall of thc @Ct|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: @H 3-3|pg||
nt|benjent: yes, 2@s, 3@h, 3@d and 4@c - not a great contract though!|pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: not at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwb: so last hand, thx all for coming|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|benjent: I guess 3NT meant 4333 minimum. Good control by von Arnim to pass it out.|pg||
nt|askgaard: Well done to stay low. With my usual luck I would have been down 1 in 4NT.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 20-22 I played 28 years ago or so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joefri: and then you have all possibilities to upgrade 10, downgrade 22 and so on. If you know your hand-evaluator by heart :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bertens-Bakkeren use there multi-purpose 2@C/@D/@H openings to define all 2 point NT spreads from 20-21 all the way to 30-31|pg||

nt|vugraphzvs: she has to guess hearts, but other than that it seems that all the cards help|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Last board... time to say goodbye, tx Joerg, Hans and Al and above all Paolo (?) for the very good operating job ( even on board 19 :) )|pg||
nt|joefri: Egypt and Sweden with 278 still competing for qualification|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: a very lucky player would find KJx with East ;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DJ as @HJ would make big difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: minimizing the chances of a misguess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even then needs to find @HK or @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: thanks all|pg||
nt|joefri: Guessing @C (not so difficult) and guessing @H (50:50) they will make this bad slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point being -- i think this 4333 should not accept - but agree very close|pg||
nt|werge: Will East alse-card with @C 10?|pg||
nt|werge: false|pg||
nt|joefri: all 3 9's in N-Hand look good. But maybe South should not invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks dangerous with @C8 in dummy|pg||
nt|joefri: 10 tricks were made in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north holds 5 card suit - the south hand could be very good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just needed way to say my invite is 4333|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|joefri: Some can check for distribution of opener after 2@D and give up learning opener is 4333 as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: in the open room it was a completely different game... declarer ducked the spade lead, and avoided the @c finesse into the dangerous hand at the ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: luxuries this North can't afford|pg||
nt|joefri: Decision time ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and others over 1N-2@C;2@D  differentiate rebids of 4@S/4N  [some even use 4@H as some artifical slam try]|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if playing the 10--> 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: slightly better chance (for 5-1)|pg||
nt|joefri: but then she needs @H 3-3 as well ..... @H-Q also wins agains Jx with West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with Germany 5th  Denmark 7th through board 31   we can guess impact of make vs down|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so she must play 10 if she following female intuition :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know VP scale enough to be confident|pg||
