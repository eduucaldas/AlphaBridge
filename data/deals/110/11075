nt|lc: I am here to harass Berk.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: A noble task!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Larry just wants to be prepared for the phone call :)|pg||
nt|lc: TOugh decision here for Berk|pg||
nt|lc: Might not be sure if Pass is forcing.|pg||
nt|lc: it would be in our partenrship,|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D my choice|pg||
nt|lc: Nice 4@S by Swanson -- very "LAWful"|pg||
nt|lc: 5@D is possible, but it doesn't take much for slam opposite.|pg||
nt|lc: As here :)|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe too strong for 5@D with that powerful control-rich North hand.|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, 7@D not bad at all.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Depends on how much Mark showed with 2@h.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i dont treat this as forcing pass situation, so what choice|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, 6@D if they reach it is very easy to play on likely @CK lead.  Win, play @DA, @HK, @DK, @HA and @HJ throwing @C and claim.|pg||
nt|lc: 4NT is possible.|pg||
nt|lc: Whatever that means.|pg||
nt|lc: Prob RKC in @H though, so  not an option.|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bid 4N ..and correct|pg||
nt|lc: 6@D is possible -- |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Slow X is the worst.|pg||

nt|lc: Partner can't ethically pull.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||

nt|lc: Looks like a Stayman auction to 4@S here for N-S|pg||
nt|lc: Missing a great slam in the process (again).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: A "perfect fitter" -- hard to reach slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless s decided his hand is too good for 1nt.  Never mind.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lc: Atfer 1N-2@C-2@S can North really make a try?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lc: I think just 4@S is likely to be bid.|pg||
nt|lc: I never like to look for "magic".|pg||
nt|lc: David is used to me NEVER having the perfect hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you play splinters as "slam barely possible", why not|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe, though, Lair sometimes has it for him (as here).|pg||
nt|lc: The problem with 4@D, is that  : |pg||
nt|lc: 1) I'd like a little more.|pg||
nt|lc: 2) helps defense|pg||
nt|lc: But, if you assume game easy on any lead, then " 2" not an issue.|pg||
nt|lc: Also, he has to remember his system with Lair.  They don't play together much.|pg||
nt|lc: The modern method here is :|pg||
nt|lc: "|pg||
nt|lc: 3@H = unbal slam try-- artif.|pg||
nt|lc: 4@D = balanced alsm try, artif.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my view is your never too weak to splinter, but could be too strong|pg||
nt|lc: 4@C = Gerber|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Well, you'd bee too weak if you took away North's @CQ for sure!|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Berk can now at least say he thought about it.|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s ...solves the memory problem|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: it was definitely worth 3@H if that is an option|pg||
nt|lc: Some tables will reach slam after a Strong 1@C by South and @S shown by North -- maybe room to investigate.|pg||
nt|santyclz: With Berk and Solodar here we can safely predict we won't be the 1st table finished.|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: Swanson (Paul, that is) jumped to 4@S - in this case a very effective pre-empt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru: another slam..|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 6@S seems an easy contract to make|pg||

nt|flash: 4@D to show shortness now?|pg||

nt|flash: or is that too avant garde for this pair??|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: In context 3@S is a slam try!|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@S gives much more room to investigate|pg||

nt|lc: Have to have knowledge of partnership style.|pg||
nt|lc: For DB-LC 2@H is permissible, though quite heavy for these colors.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Europeans would say is too strong, looks about right to me|pg||
nt|lc: I'd say it is too strong -- but if playing constructive weak 2's, then it is okay.|pg||
nt|lc: I'd prefer to be VUL -- since for once, I really have my bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2 quick tricks, 6/4 how about 1@h?|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, all roads will lead to West guessing 3NT, I'd think -- at some point.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lc: West can X then bid 3NT.  OR just bid 3NT directly.|pg||
nt|lc: I like X first -- as it leaves more room to explore.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: I prefer 3NT to be more like "This is where I want to play, no matter what."|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gosia: playing Lebensol hate to double when I want to play no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: West has many other things in mind, like 6@C, or 4@S opposite, say @SQJxxx @Hxx....|pg||
nt|lc: Now, 3NT by WEst -- all pass, I'd think.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT tends to show long solid minor and heart stop, no interest in 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: West could torture his partner with 3@H, I suppose.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: There is the torture.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: true torture here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lc: So, 3@S by Solodar, then 3NT?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Too likely to get 4@s on @sqxxx.|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, Swanson should be sensitive to the fact that his partner could even have only THREE @S  (something like   xxx   xxxx  xxx  xxx).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you already suggest 4@S possible with double, so 3NT would not preclude a conversion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Anyway, it looks like he will be a trick short.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lc: Hard to imagine a defensive accident, but it is never pleasant to discard on the run of declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|lc: Actually, I forsee some trouble for Berk.|pg||
nt|lc: He might have to be very careful.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lc: Declarer will run @C and Berk has to make 2 discards.|pg||
nt|lc: North will be in some danger of providing declarer with a 2nd diamond trick.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how can he go wrong, more danger that lair pitches too many hearts|pg||
nt|lc: He can easily go wrong -- can't he?|pg||
nt|lc: For example, if he throws 2 @S, declarer is home -- exits in @S and Berk must break @D.|pg||
nt|gosia: Lair is thinking if should win and switch, which will squal the whole hand to Swanson|pg||
nt|lc: So, Berk has to keep 4 @S.|pg||
nt|lc: Dec exits with low @S -- then what?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lc: I see this as a big problem for the defense.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lc: They discard Odd-Even.  Each defender has thrown an odd card in the suit he likes.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lc: Really no choice but to make it now.|pg||
nt|lc: @SA and a @S -- or a low @S -- either works.|pg||
nt|lc: North must break @D -- 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose declarer can go wrong and try @D himself.|pg||
nt|lc: This could be right if South had @Shonor and more than 1 @S.|pg||

nt|flash: for those who haven't been glued to their computer displays, this is the 3rd of 6 16-board sets|pg||
nt|flash: 96 boards plus carry-over from the round-robin|pg||
nt|flash: USA 1 finished 4th in the round-robin and got the unpicked team from those finishing 5th-8th|pg||
nt|flash: not at all surprisingly, that was USA 2|pg||
nt|flash: USA 2 had beaten USA 1 soundly in the round-robin, so they got 1/3 of the margin in carry-over...   10 2/3 IMPs|pg||

nt|lc: So, no need to finesse @CJ.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so Larrys argument says spades not breaking, and yes can make|pg||

nt|fabsayc: he might be more suspicious on club or spade lead|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, GIB will make this, but I don't think LAIR will.|pg||
nt|lc: Problem for declarer is even if both majors are 3-2, he still has to build 1 more trick.|pg||
nt|lc: For example, win @DA, draw 3 trump, @HAK -- ruff a @H -- no good.  A trick short.|pg||
nt|lc: So, he might play @HAK before drawing all the trump. That will obcviously fail.|pg||

nt|othered1: Some open south with 2@C, a dangerous way to handle a 3-suiter.|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to Ed for helping with the commentary|pg||
nt|othered1: Lair, in open room, opened 11D.|pg||
