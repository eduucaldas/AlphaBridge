nt|athene: it doesn't give you much room to invite|pg||

nt|ahollan1: only if forcing :)|pg||
nt|athene: 5@H fro, Brogeland now is possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there doesn't seem to be a consensus about whether Leaping Michaels should be Forcing or not -- what does the panel think?|pg||
nt|athene: i think it shld be forcing|pg||
nt|athene: you don't climb all the way to the 4-level to play a partscore, as Meckstroth points out|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: Brogeland might have done better to pre-empt more vigorously first time but he was hampered if their multi includes strong hands|pg||

mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: the other argument is  pressure on simple overcalls since they may include good 2-suiters that are NOT game force|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is not automatic game force, but 2@S is FG  [3@D rebid would be NF]|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: EW discover the club-shaped hole in their auction and will surely settle for the 5-2 heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: although the @H10 makes that a LOT better|pg||
nt|danilo1: anothe friendly distribution for agressive bidders|pg||
nt|athene: and they can't find that|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: west goes for the 4-3 rather than the 5-2 major fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps hoping his partner has 3-5-3-2 shape|pg||
nt|athene: so he won't get forced in the long trump hand|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: would anyone/everyone force to game with West opposite 11-15?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|athene: so he has to set up the hearts first|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|danilo1: I thk West choice for 4-3 instead @H 5-3 is wrong (probably no matter this board since @S 3-3) ... but as they bid, with no @C stopp, he should choose to ruff from shorth, ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: therefore, he should bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: north will surely duck the first heart|pg||
nt|danilo1: *5-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it would be outrageous for big club auction to go  1@H-1@S;1N[11-12]-P|pg||
nt|pelu: now duck the @H and take nexo and let S ruff = @S10 take the down 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: your question indicates the answer, Al|pg||
nt|athene: no choice surely for now but to play @HJ and hope something good happens?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|athene: very very interesting position now|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can set up BOTH red suits to kill south's trump holding|pg||
nt|athene: he sort of uses both red suits as substitute trumps|pg||
nt|athene: in some lines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i blinked -- when did Espen play the @S10|pg||
nt|jbgood: too interesting for my biased objectivety:)|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a trump switch he just wins, ruffs diamond with that precious @S6, and plays @H|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 was costly but these positions are a nightmare to defend|pg||
nt|danilo1: may ruff only 1 @D  ... second @D will be overruffed - with 4 (5) ... but may not be easy for North to believe that|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: west knows it's very likely north hasn't got the @S8|pg||
nt|athene: he did ruff with the @S10|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might be flat anyway if EW other room play 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: or if declarer in 4@S chooses the superior line of just setting up hearts|pg||
nt|danilo1: still, 1 trick is missing, one way or another ... except if @C now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room East is playing 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: no, it always makes now|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok i am told 4@H was down|pg||
nt|danilo1: so .. @H - ruffed by S|pg||
nt|danilo1: or .. @S -- how does he make?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: for sure a very fast table - but no mistake tx Aline|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: last board. tks everyone and see you in a few minutes...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was "5th suit forcing" was it, to get partner to bid 3nt with @DQx?|pg||
nt|danilo1: of course, 3NT also on ... and 4@S (with little more work too) ... hope they will note play in @D :)|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts and clubs were less happy than they are, it might be necessary to organize it so there were two diamond stoppers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set begins in 55 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@D = cue accepting @C|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: North may bid 4@S now (to play hopefully) ... if affraid of @D suit ... but South may correct to 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: south knows his partner has shortage in @S and/or @D|pg||
nt|athene: kings and queens aren't what he wants there|pg||
nt|athene: if he had aces in those suits and the KQ in clubs, then he would have more reason to get excited in clubs, i think|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|danilo1: guess South has no options here except 5@C |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north decided, i think, that south's sequence expressed doubt|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: with a hand which definitely wanted to play 3nt he would just bid that over 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think 3@D is a cue for clubs|pg||
