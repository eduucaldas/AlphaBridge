nt|daman: and here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: .|pg||
nt|daman: North make open 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: usa have a 5 imp carryover from the round robin|pg||
nt|lc: I think North is worth 1NT  15-17|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Cecilia    good luck to you|pg||
nt|daman: may*|pg||
nt|lc: 14 HCP +1 for the 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Cecilia. Welcome to you too and good luck! Cecilia is the most important person for this broadcast|pg||
nt|lc: Also, 1NT has preemptive effect.|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: next to you Roland :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 3NT plays better than 4@S on this hand. |pg||
nt|daman: he said   tongue-in-cheek|pg||
nt|roswolf: in that case will reach 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: It's not my style to overcall 1@S.|pg||
nt|petergill: the 1@s overcall will stop NS from getting to 4@SX|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: ok guys... Cecilia is in other room. Today is Aline with you. Wellcome all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello Aline|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: Might lead to 1@S X.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: thanks Aline    good luck to you too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Bertens is not getting cheated with his flat 12-count.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dutch are naturally aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Surely, Nickell should have doubled!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Double would show a trap pass of 1@S -- which he has.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: left to their own devices over a strong NT   NS might have ended up playing 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: He also has @CJxx -- plenty in a suit partner rates to have som elength in.|pg||
nt|petergill: Huub Bertens was sure a penalty pass was about to happen, so he esaped to 2@C|pg||
nt|lc: This clearly should have been 2@C doubled with a trump lead.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: yes not waiting for the guns to open up|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: agree|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lc: Did Katz win the @DQ -- not the @D10 at trick one?  Seems hard to believe.|pg||
nt|petergill: A double of 2@C by South primarily means that South has a decent hand that was about to pass 1@SX|pg||
nt|daman: was that an undo with the @D Q?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: yes... he won with the Q|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -1 and may be more|pg||
nt|lc: Seems like N-S aren't warmed up yet :)|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, I would have bid 1N-P-4@H-P-4@S and played in 4@S N-S -- and I suspect that will happen at many tables.|pg||

nt|lc: Of course, those datums or "Butlers" can be very misleading.|pg||
nt|petergill: Ton Bakkeren and Huub Bertens were 19th in the datums , or Butler scores|pg||
nt|lc: It depends on who plays against Western Angolesia, and who plays against Italy.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|petergill: Katz - Nickell played mainly against the weaker teams in the Qualifying. There are no weaker pairs left now.  |pg||
nt|lc: We'll find out what 2@S shows in a moment, but even a natural weak 2@S at these colors would appeal in modern bridge.|pg||
nt|georgej: 5-5|pg||
nt|lc: 5@S + 5 any?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S basically any weak hand with 5+@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOT necessarily a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|lc: South has a dilemma over 2@S|pg||
nt|lc: Dangerous to bid (2NT) -- dangerous to pass.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lc: Ooops|pg||
nt|daman: nothwithstanding the butlers, Nickell is a many time world champion and Katz is a world class player in his own right|pg||
nt|lc: 2NT surely won't be a happy bid here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: This one is getting doubled|pg||
nt|georgej: Where can Ralph go?|pg||
nt|roswolf: red card = excitement!?|pg||
nt|daman: he is going for a number|pg||
nt|lc: The danger in passing, is that if partner has a flat 11, you miss out on 600.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: The danger in bidding, of course is shown here.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|georgej: Nickell may have thought they were stealing|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm blood is about to flow|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S = 5@S, 4+ minor in 1st/3rd green versus red (i.e. here), 3-10, else 5@S, 5+ minor|pg||

mb|3N|nt|daman: applying the ax was tough on the last|pg||
nt|lc: Easy 3NT bid for Nickell -- no point in a Neg X when he knows what to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|petergill: Ton Bakkeren seemed to consider bidding 4@C briefly.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||

nt|lc: You can't believe some of the crazy preempt Bergen made in the name of "favorable."|pg||
nt|lc: Only if Claude and you both happen to remember at the same time.|pg||
nt|daman: when you bid 4@C you are unilaterally taking partner out of the auction    every now and then he might happen to have a decent hand...the type that makes 3NT|pg||

nt|lc: These days, most pairs, when a major-suit fit is established, use 3NT as articial -- some sort of slam (or non-slam) message.|pg||
nt|georgej: 3NT some kind of serious/non slam try|pg||

nt|petergill: That's one thing about these experts, they take percentage plays. Huub Bertens in my opinion is one  of the very best card players in the world, and quickest card play thinkers, so ...|pg||
nt|petergill: if there is any reason, he will find it.  |pg||

nt|lc: Other than a "tell" or seeing the opponents hands, I can't see any reason to guess this one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|georgej: there is no time to get any counts. you are down 1 as soon as you do|pg||
nt|lc: Probably good for Dutch rooters -- as I think 6@S would have been -100.|pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore team orange are safe on this one|pg||
nt|georgej: I think it is 100% that Meckwell bids it|pg||
nt|lc: George, you wouldn't run the diamonds before trying to guess the trump queen?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: 4@S might be a lucky gain for the Dutch, although if Meckwell find a keycard and @SQ missing, they too might stay out of slam|pg||

pc|s5|nt|petergill: I think he will take @SA and play @S3 as suit pref for clubs|pg||
nt|lc: The tricky play which almost works is @SA and a quick @D back. Declarer might hop  ACE and then play @HA and another @H -- but why would South find that play.|pg||

nt|georgej: looks like always trumps holds him to 9|pg||
nt|lc: Having such good holding in declarer's suit, I'd think a trump to stop ruffs would be much more appealing than setting up declarer's suit.|pg||

nt|georgej: @S 9?|pg||
nt|lc: @S9 or @C10.|pg||
nt|roswolf: any black card i think|pg||
nt|lc: I doubt he will play the @C5 -- willing to bet on that. :)|pg||
nt|lc: On a @S, what will Katz do?|pg||
nt|lc: He needs lots of cross-ruffing -- and has to decide @S10, @SQ or @SA.|pg||
nt|georgej: He has to wonder why E did not lead a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: Depending on how the play goes (not if a trump now), on the 4th @D South might be able to pitch a club loser from dummy, loser on loser play|pg||

nt|georgej: 4 will get you 6 here|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: That should be it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Not unreasonable at all to rest in 5@C with N-S cards.|pg||

nt|petergill: guess |pg||

nt|georgej: but ours is easier to spell|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: This is the first set of 6 -- 96 boards total in this match.|pg||
nt|petergill: George's point is interesting - the very long term partnerships have an advantage in deep understandings of things like "is 4@H natural or cue bid?" |pg||
nt|daman: words with more than 2 syllables give me a headache|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: One reason that Brazil bombed out this year is meant to be that Brazil had new partnership(s) playing new understandings, and it takes more time for the results to come. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: North's DBL already said 4@H so don't show again after Opener's takeout double|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe Brink has to shoot it out |pg||
nt|kit: I think North didn't evaluate his hand properly -- he should realize he hs good cards and make some move|pg||
nt|kit: Sout shouldn't go -- he needs king of hearts, ace of diamonds, queen of clubs, and if North had all these (as he does), he shouldn't have bid 5@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i doubt it -- takes up too much space|pg||
