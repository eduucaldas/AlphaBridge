pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, the key question here is whether to play a trump|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: he simply plays trumps to break 2-2 to avoid complication.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he might get overruffed with the SJ if he proceeds crossruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Eric Rodwell correctly planned the play in some detail before even playing to Trick 2 - no over-hasty @CK at Trick 2. |pg||
nt|athene: playing a trump might work out ok if south has a singleton @SA or @SK|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't entirely reliant on a 2-2 break|pg||
nt|gracelin: his concern is whether to play small spade to cater for south's singleton A or K, or SQ to drop a singleton J.|pg||
nt|petergill: This play succeeds if trumps are 2-2 or "singleton @SK or 1SA in South with @H 4-3". If Rodwell plays it this way, I assume it is probably the best line of play, avoiding overruff ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, but luckily it's 5-1 here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: I thk declarer shud duck 2 round of spade.  There is no reason for north to shift to H after declarer ducked the spades.|pg||
nt|athene: ducking two and hoping for 5-1 hearts or no heart shift is possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it's hard when you are mixing objective and psychological odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "which is more likely - this break or this slip in defence?" that sort of thing|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobh1: thin game here|pg||
nt|bobh1: needs to guess trumps among other problems|pg||
nt|gracelin: when you partner found the spade lead and declarer ducked, it looks right to continue spade rather than to shift to dmmy's 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|petergill: Very weak hearts in dummy, and East unlikely to have 3 @H's, so if @H's are 4-2, the heart switch is looming, and even if @H's 3-3, a @H switch is possible. Hard to say which line ...|pg||
nt|petergill: was best, I think|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: gib says you can't afford to duck here - i am just wondering why :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: Trumps 4-1, @S's not breaking, @CA offside makes this 4@h a challenge for declarer too. A very hard challenge|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a diamond and two clubs but it might be possible to crossruff the hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: now we are back to making|pg||
nt|athene: so ducking was obviously wrong because it allowed south to do something killing like play a trump?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: ok - gib analysis no use on this hand because it all depends so much on the specific layout|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer had to run the @C9, finessing against the @C10 to build a club|pg||
nt|bobh1: germany made 3n on the previous board|pg||
nt|bobh1: they are now leading|pg||
nt|gracelin: so when declarer ducked the first D, south shud shift to spade, and eventually let north discard his 3rd club on 3rd spade to deny declarer any club trick|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: it was a race between the black suits amazingly enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 31: Since @S2 had not been played on Bd 31, it looked to East like spades were 4-4, South having led @S3 from xx32 in spades. Hence winning the second spade was clearly best, I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: now think, due to @S2 not being played. Thanks to Joe Shair for pointing this out|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: north finds the club pitch|pg||
nt|gracelin: I still thk defenders had no idea they had two cashable D tricks so only need to develop one H trick to beat 3NT.  I am quite confident defender will continue Spade if declarer ...|pg||
nt|gracelin: ducked two rounds.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 31: However, at the other table, NS's carding made it look like spades were 5-3, so ducking two spades was correct. So both declarers played Bd 31 correctly in my opinion, and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: it was NS's unusual 3rd best lead versus NT that triumphed. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 31 summary: Germany did well and took the lead. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 31: Piekarek ducked two spades at Tricks 1 and 2 at the other table, so the defence could not set up spades.  |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess declarer is doomed now|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have to win a heart trick|pg||
nt|bobh1: this has been a great match, thx to all|pg||
nt|gracelin: good lead, DQ will allow the contract be made|pg||
nt|athene: north correctly avoids the trap of giving ruff/discard with @DQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|athene: that is often the right play when you have long trumps|pg||
nt|athene: to weaken declarer's combined trump holding|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: but not here, where he basically just wants to crossruff|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: it would help him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think this hand Bd 32 is too hard for human declarers who can see only 52 cards, although perhaps Germany will prove me wrong. |pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: see only 26 cards I mean|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i don't see how you can possibly view to play the clubs "right"|pg||
nt|athene: (run @C9) |pg||
nt|bobh1: germany has been very impressive|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks all and bye.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to our operaor and everyone else. and to the players from both sides for putting on a great show of world class bridge|pg||
nt|petergill: When commentators at other tables talk about ducking two spades on Bd 31 as textbook play, they mean if you can tell that spades are 5-3. But not at this table where you cannot ...|pg||
nt|petergill: tell that|pg||
nt|petergill: I prefer the analysis of Bd 31 at this table to the analysis at other tables, but I am biased. :)|pg||
