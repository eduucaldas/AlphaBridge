nt|joest: I believe this is a playback from the second set|pg||
nt|imp_jan: cold slam|pg||
nt|barnets: after 1@S 2@H|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: hamman bid 5@D and zia passed|pg||
nt|barnets: North was good for 5@D bid|pg||
nt|askgaard: Even a grand slam has reasonable play, but is not quite good enough though.|pg||
nt|joest: it is tough to know what Hamman ought to have done over 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: let's go|pg||
nt|benjent: The auction will be different here - if only because NS play strong @c|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|joest: but I suspect it will be at 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|an|4!h+ GF|nt|rhelle: Muller desribes his hand as 9+ with @h|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|royhughes: NS must have an interesting set of responses over interference|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is very important for strong clubbers|pg||
nt|barnets: now north can bid diamonds and south can cue|pg||
nt|rhelle: they do - we call it' 2-up|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wc ro helle: tarzan precision expert :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: this will give Muller room to raise diamonds I suspect: the missing piece to the puzzle in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: indeed - he may bid 5@d or do something more enterprising|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|joest: as in 4@s|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@s, excellent|pg||
nt|royhughes: He seems full value for a cuebid|pg||
nt|benjent: I was about to say - if Muller finds 4@s, they will easily bid the slam|pg||
nt|askgaard: Maybe they will even bid 7 now|pg||
nt|joest: they can make seven if they have to|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rhelle: North can discard 1 @c on the @h Ace|pg||
nt|barnets: 7 requires a heart guess|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly|pg||
nt|joest: plus it goes to show the old adage: why risk a grand when you'd be surprised how often your opponents miss the small?|pg||
nt|royhughes: very true|pg||
nt|joest: as conceivable as that might seem at this level|pg||
nt|askgaard: North is torn between blasting 7 or inviting|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|benjent: Even though the Netherlands are chasing, it's important for them to remember that (a) there's plenty of time left and (b) even at this level of competition, there's no guarantee ...|pg||
nt|benjent: the other table has even bid the small slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think netherlands want 7|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|rhelle: No, but 5@s gave South the option to give one more sign of life|pg||
nt|askgaard: After 4@s Muller has done his duty|pg||
nt|benjent: Muller doesn't have much left in the tank - sensible stop |pg||
nt|rhelle: finally the relay system produces a decent result :)|pg||
nt|barnets: dec could poss run the @HJ in 7 playing west for the Q|pg||
nt|joest: if Muller were playing it in seven, we would need to book hotel rooms :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|royhughes: In 7, declarer would note that West has the short trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||

pc|hA|nt|askgaard: Credit to Bakkeren also for being willing to bid 4@s opposite a possible 'modern' overcall|pg||

nt|daman: Larry is probably commentating Berk's match|pg||
nt|georgej: Start right off with a slam|pg||
nt|daman: as commentators, we muxt remain impartial|pg||
nt|georgej: He is|pg||
nt|daman: must*|pg||
nt|jallerton: correct answer!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|howiew: whatever|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|jallerton: Slam to start with|pg||
nt|daman: 3 bids in and we have 1000 specs|pg||
nt|georgej: 7 appears cold, if not reachable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't apply here but NS get to choose the opening bid with 4@C & 4@D|pg||
nt|daman: and climbing|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|georgej: does Zia have enough to push?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Zia has a nice hand, but partner y have stretched|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|howiew: an awfully good hand to just bid 5D.|pg||
nt|georgej: and did Hamman really show his hand?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: what do you think he should bid over 4@S?   4NT?|pg||
nt|howiew: I prefer double to see if I can elicit D! support nad drive to six if 5D from partnr|pg||
nt|georgej: terrible result for S_N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|georgej: Good 4@S bid|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|georgej: kib suggests good/bad 4nt|pg||
nt|daman: 5@D was a rubber bridge bid methinks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4NT would offer choice of strains, or perhaps a good raise to 5@h.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Pass would not be forcing|pg||
nt|georgej: well he will probably make this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also possible this pair play 4N RKC @H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|howiew: If I double 4@S and partner sits, I don't mind.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|jallerton: So North has to guess between 5@d and 6@d.  He guessed wrong this time|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: and a real bidding test|pg||
mb|1H|an|4!s+ GF|nt|rhelle: 1@h shows @s|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 slams first two boards!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rhelle: and unbalanced|pg||
nt|benjent: just knock out @cA|pg||
nt|royhughes: Its a good slam, but not laydown|pg||
nt|joest: right if neither clubs nor hearts worked there would be issues|pg||
nt|rhelle: also, a positive respones guarantees 2 controls|pg||
nt|imp_jan: right roy|pg||
nt|askgaard: Bertens 2@c in the closed room showed a weak two in @d|pg||
nt|benjent: If @s are 2-2, it's pretty close to a spread; if not you need something useful happening in @h or @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: pass = forcing, and a realy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: you would be very unlucky to go down|pg||
nt|rhelle: relay|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes that is a typical dutch method: 2@c = weak in dia (often 5 crd) or something strong|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: I'm curious why Muller would not 'raise' spades there.  Would that be a relay?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: no, pass is the relay. |pg||
nt|joest: ok thx|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rhelle: now they are fresh out of relays, so dbl = takeout, 3@s natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: no it isn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: South can expect a singleton @d opposite, so he'll go to slam now|pg||
nt|benjent: The takeout X is great news for Muller. He'll be wondering which slam try to make|pg||
nt|rhelle: ah - so what was it, operaot?|pg||
nt|joest: does north really have to have a singleton diamond?|pg||
nt|joest: unless the t/o double guarantees shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: Operator - Jessie :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: the thing is that they have made some subtle changes in hte system that I play, so sometimes it's hard to exactly know what's going on|pg||
nt|joest: an honest man|pg||
nt|rhelle: if my interpretation is correct so far, 3NT = serious|pg||
nt|askgaard: NS play 'nonserious 3NT', so 3NT probably shows a bad hand for slam (primarily chosen because of the bad trumps)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: wow, well bid, and quick :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And Muller's choice of slam try was ... 6@s :)|pg||
nt|joest: bid a slam and try to make it|pg||
nt|royhughes: Muller appreciates that it is difficult for partner to try for slam when you yourself hold AKQ in trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is the 'Steve Green' rule ... if partner shows slam interest, and you have AKQ of trumps, then just bid it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|joest: that sounds like a pretty good rle|pg||
nt|joest: ruel|pg||
nt|joest: rule|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is an interesting slam to play.  Maybe draw all trumps and play a club up|pg||
nt|barnets: slam looks in the high 80s as a percentage|pg||
nt|benjent: got it every time, Jack. I wonder how many ways we could spell "rule" and still be understood :)|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Have to try one top spade in case they're 4-0|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then heart to the king and another club up.|pg||
nt|rhelle: seems to me that if @s are 4-0, you're off|pg||
nt|joest: it would speed up the play though :)|pg||
nt|joest: this won't be so easy not knowing everything breaks|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think declarer's main problem is to decide if he can afford to draw all three trumps and still have enough communication|pg||
nt|benjent: And you can manage yourself to minimize the off|pg||
nt|royhughes: to pick up the various chances|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS have not have the best of time with slams over the last couple of days - glad to see the tide turning for them|pg||
nt|cumino: Spade 2-2, or club 3-3 or Q 2@H|pg||
nt|joest: their system wrongsided a slam in the last set|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he should draw all the trumps because 5-1 clubs is a real possibility|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 2 high trumps and a club|pg||
nt|benjent: You want to play clubs towards the KQ twice, to allow for @cAx onside|pg||
nt|cumino: Q1H 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: then the third trump and another club|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|joest: that permits you to test clubs before committing tohearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|askgaard: I don't see any problem with drawing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 2 spades, then @c up, then 3rd @s, then another @c up|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dummy reversal|pg||
nt|royhughes: It seems to me you can afford drawing 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: me too|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|georgej: well done by them|pg||
nt|jallerton: Well, North might have bid 5@h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: sure wish i knew the inferences that get 6@S bid over 5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise - why not just 4@D-6@S|pg||
nt|georgej: Zia was just super max|pg||
nt|georgej: and Zia|pg||
nt|jallerton: in case they had a grand on, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 5@S just says no grand?  or confirms bad @S  |pg||
nt|georgej: I never saw 20,000 people on BBo before|pg||
nt|howiew: all lines lead to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point is - not sure what he learned when Hamman didn't bid convenient 5@H|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|howiew: the 5@D call was a minimum.  Haman properly pulled in his horns after that.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@s shows not enough to bid slam or bid 5@h.  On that basis, Zia new grand was not in the picture|pg||

nt|georgej: I understand it was 22,000 earlier|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||

nt|barnets: at one point e/w were in 2@Sxx in this auction|pg||
nt|barnets: but zia south bid 3@D|pg||
nt|barnets: which was x|pg||
mb|3H|nt|askgaard: You lead twice towards KQ and play a thirds (hope for 3-3) but then west plays a 4th and we are locked in dummy|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Classic Zia auction - opens a weak 2, then re-enters via a takeout X in front of his partner|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: that deprives you of the heart finesse option|pg||
nt|askgaard: We could of course then just finesse east for the @hQ, so no big problem|pg||
nt|rhelle: on careful defence, this looks 1 off|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is not surprising with that dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|barnets: it may take a while to defend though|pg||
nt|benjent: De Wijs best play is to cash the @sQ then get off lead with the @h9 - avoid later endplays|pg||
nt|royhughes: or get out in clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think he'll exit in @c, to avoid giving tricks away|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|benjent: Getting out in @c works because we can see all 4 hands - De Wijs can't|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|royhughes: I thought declarer might cash some clubs first to strip exit cards|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|benjent: he knows Rodwell probably has 2 hearts, and therefore his partner has @hKQ or @hA - getting out a @h is reasonably safe|pg||

nt|barnets: will be 5 imps to netherlands|pg||
nt|benjent: Cashing @c's would tip off the defence to the layout - Rodwell's best chance of a make was sucking the defence into error|pg||

nt|rhelle: Now North has a choice: 3@s as a 'strong' relay, and 4@c as a 'weak' relay|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rhelle: 3@s is only interested in the number of controls|pg||

nt|imp_jan: aha, but down under rooted? symmetric relay?|pg||
nt|barnets: east x a cue bid of 5@C now north bid slam inopen slam is decent knowing a club lead|pg||
nt|royhughes: 6@s is complicated.  If you get a club trick, then it seems you need both majors 3-2, or heart queen stiff|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, it comes from Australia / New Zealand originally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=33557&st=0& entry393519  for Monday's vugraph matches from Brazil (segment 4 only)|pg||
nt|joest: I am getting the answer to my question|pg||
nt|royhughes: If you don't have a club trick after the lead, it is a little worse|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: Wijs-Muller as in Johnny Weismuller|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect so - I used to play Symmetric Relay, and the sequence through 3@s was very familiar|pg||
nt|rhelle: Oops - not Rosenburg, but Barry Rigal|pg||
nt|barnets: well @H finesse is sufficient also|pg||
nt|askgaard: Without a club lead, the slam might make. After a trump lead, it's sensible to finesse hearts and hope for 6 heart tricks.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d was another relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h shows the A or K (or both) in @h, but denies AKQ|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, if they don't lead clubs, you could finesse hearts and hope to avoid playing for a club trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: and it shows the @sQ, and denies anything in @c|pg||
nt|askgaard: If we ruff up the hearts instead we will also need to make a club trick, and that might be a problem (without a club lead)|pg||
nt|barnets: @H finnese works with heaarts 4-1onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: he can't stop, of course - 4@s = relay :)|pg||
nt|joest: if defense plays club and a club why wouldn't you test spades and finding them 3-2 try to ruff out the heart?|pg||
nt|royhughes: Rodwell refrained from doubling 4@c, wisely|pg||
nt|joest: which btw is what Hamman did|pg||
nt|barnets: that is what hamman did |pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|barnets: and is natural |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: If there is a club lead, the club trick is in the bag and it's obviously best to try for 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|rhelle: he's asked for a @d lead, so I think he should lead one|pg||
nt|joest: hearing that South is 4=6=1=2 I'm guessing Meck will lead a club|pg||
nt|askgaard: right|pg||
nt|benjent: And if @s are 4-1, you need the @h finesse|pg||
nt|joest: right but once you see they are 3-2 you will fall from grace :)|pg||
nt|benjent: So really, it's quite an unlucky hand - "if only spades had been 4-1, partner"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: yes victor silverstone suggest the @DK if he leads a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: as he knows dummy has s ing|pg||
nt|benjent: There's the small matter of the @h9 to deal with, but I think you might get there, assuming West is the one with 4 spades|pg||
nt|joest: it's interesting that not knowing what trumps were going to be, Meck chose to double 4@d but Rodwell passed on doubling 4@c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: I did that against chemla in the european championship once and it didnt work out|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, back on starship Earth, this is an oddly useful lead for declarer|pg||
nt|rhelle: by the way, about the system ... once North hears 3 controlsd and South denies a @c honour, North knows that South has the !a AK|pg||
nt|joest: will it make a difference?|pg||
nt|barnets: zia would have led the K its his style|pg||
nt|imp_jan: the lead might indicate decl about the pos of @HQ (perhaps) |pg||
nt|royhughes: It seems to be similar to getting a club trick -- makes declarer likely to try to ruff out hearts|pg||
nt|askgaard: A fine lead for the defense I think, since it should induce declarer to try for hearts 3-2 rather than a finesse|pg||
nt|benjent: I think the stiff @h will still give him trouble. In the end, I think this will just give Wijs reason to think longer :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Before he goes for @s's 3-2 and then @h's 3-2|pg||
nt|cumino: With trup lead is about impossibile to make. Now difficult but  possibile |pg||
nt|askgaard: In 4@s, it would have been the right play to finesse hearts, but not in 6...|pg||

nt|imp_jan: yep|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's easy to take 5 diamonds when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|rhelle: he has 4, can afford a positive signal|pg||
nt|rhelle: Ace asks for attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the 2 shows the Queen|pg||
nt|barnets: you can meckwell bid a lot that is their style of play|pg||
nt|askgaard: Interesting that Muller chose the @dA and not a small one|pg||
nt|barnets: and generally it puts pressure onthe opposition and it works in the long run|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are playing reverse signals, so 2 looks encouraging|pg||
nt|joest: interestingly enough their card is marked that their first NT signal on partner's lead is count|pg||
nt|royhughes: If now diamond to jack, and queen, does Muller have to figure out who has last diamon?|pg||
nt|joest: upside down count|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes - that is the trouble with not playing the Q in trick 1 - that Queen would also be an unblock|pg||
nt|benjent: Their card says they lead K from AK with strong suits - that would be suits like AKJ109|pg||
nt|joest: king is their 'power' lead so Muller didn't want any unblocking going on|pg||
nt|royhughes: I guess it's not a problem -- if declarer has it the suit has already been blocked|pg||
nt|joest: A seems to be for attitude|pg||
nt|joest: what I'm trying to reconcile is a lead for 'attitude' and carding that shows 'count'|pg||
nt|joest: it would seem in this situation the card must be attitude else what's the point?|pg||
nt|askgaard: The card says small=enc T1, so not sure what Muller is thinking about|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear from very well informed sources that the Ace asks for attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: and that's what they then do|pg||
nt|askgaard: Perhaps partner could have Jxxxx?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that is reasonable|pg||
nt|joest: it's odd but sometimes the strongest suits are the hardest to run|pg||
nt|barnets: then he has to play the @D K|pg||
nt|royhughes: which is ok if partner has Qxxx|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|askgaard: These situations are so hard. I think that Muller is reasoning that he has likely entries to fall back on if he blocks the suit.|pg||
nt|benjent: Meckstroth will be alive to that - but he will probably assume South has the @hK, and not infer anything about the @cQ|pg||
