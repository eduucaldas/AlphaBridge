nt|kareno: Hello from Las Vegas :)|pg||

mb|3C!|an|3334|nt|rhelle: 2NT = relay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think he is hanging around in the bushes hoping to defend NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c shows 3334 exactly|pg||
nt|lc: Between Rob and Walter, we are in good shape here for knowing what all the bids mean--way to go guys!.  I can watch you explain the bids and just tell jokes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|rhelle: 3@d = strong relay; asking for controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|rhelle: 3@h = 2|pg||
nt|lc: East needs to know about the @SQ at some point for slam.|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice hands but the only thing that allows slam to make is @s Q doubleton.  AND that could be nullified by a play of two spade finesses.|pg||
nt|lc: Notice that West will declarer @H -- I think Rodwell will know what to lead.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, those diamonds speak volumes to an opening leader.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: this is not easy for Muller - he needs quite a few cards|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@d = transfer to 4@h, end signal|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|kareno: So they stop at a safe level.  |pg||
nt|lc: So, the right contract is reached -- even though a lucky 1430 was available.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|lc: In 6@H, after trumps 2-2, you have to guess if @SQ drops, OR play North for @SQ and @S10 (finesse twice).|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rhelle: East knows and Ace and a King are missing. He could have bid 4@h directly as a mild slam try, but he chose the conservative route|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, what's the math if you are in slam, Larry?  25% for two spade finesses.  How much for doubleton Q of spades?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lc: Well, it would surely be effected if North bid his @D.  (the odds).|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but Rodwell, a big clubber, knows how that sort of bid can go against him.|pg||
nt|rhelle: isn't there a rather pretty double squeeze now?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Perhaps Wijs is about to make a game try in spades?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|invit.|nt|kareno: I do too, Larry.  You have to mix them up a little and game is soooo unlikely.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: Yes, that looks likely - declines of course|pg||
nt|lc: Isn't it more effective to open 2@H than to bid 1@H- then 2@H?  Anyway, hard to argue with Rodwell's record :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle: in the other room EW are in 3NT - which looks high|pg||

pc|h4|nt|barnets: looking for points|pg||
nt|barnets: with a good suit and 2 aces|pg||
nt|howiew: Zia will duck the first heart, lead a spade from dummy at trick two.  North may rise, and it will irritiate Zia to see north also has the diamond ace.|pg||
nt|barnets: dec would need 9 winners without using one of his ace suits|pg||
nt|barnets: is zia playing it or hamman?|pg||
nt|barnets: it appears hammn is playing it|pg||
nt|howiew: Hamman is playing it.  It will take another board or two, to remember they ar opposite directions to last set.|pg||

nt|barnets: netherlands in 2@S here|pg||

nt|kareno: Yes, most unlikely that 2! would be played redoubled when you have that holding ;)|pg||
nt|lc: Notice that 2@H (showing 4@S), also DENIED a @C stopper ...|pg||
nt|lc: This is a very useful agreement to have:|pg||
nt|lc: After Stayman gets Doubled for the lead  ....|pg||
nt|lc: If you have @C stopped, you PASS and partner redoubles and that repeats the Stayman ask.,|pg||
nt|kareno: And with a weak notrump there isn't such importance placed on which hand declares.|pg||
nt|lc: If you DONT's have @C stopped, you respond immediately.|pg||

nt|lc: Will East X or 3@H?|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect double for takeout.|pg||
nt|kareno: No, with shape I'm in there.  But NOT with strong balanced hands.|pg||
nt|lc: and 3@C doubled could be the final spot.|pg||
nt|lc: A shame for N-S since they do so  much better in @D  :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: it could well be|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking it's right to bid conservatively vs big club if the clubbers know what they're doing...  frequently it only helps the strong hands|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh, I'm not sure about that - space is space|pg||
nt|lc: I agree Walter regarding low-level interference.|pg||
nt|lc: I welcomed low-level butt-ins.|pg||
nt|lc: But, the jumps kill the big@C.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H+ i agree|pg||
nt|lc: Surely, 3@H, but even 3@C often turns it into a guessing game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: anything 3@D and below just doesn't steal enough space to be worth the risk|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|lc: So, we can see that declarer can draw 2 trump and then ruff the 4th @S in dummy if he goes that way.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not really...  3@C does little if any damage...  3@D puts on a bit more pressure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi kit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lc: Well, 3@C  has damaged me over the years.  Glad you can cope so well, Water.|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||

nt|lc: Anyway, this @SJ is Rusinow, right?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: Rusinow if length?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rusinow is only on from known length|pg||
nt|lc: Your department, Walter...|pg||
nt|lc: So, now the 3@C bid has a bad effect in that it does indeed help declarer place the distribution.|pg||
nt|lc: He might think South unlikely to have @SJ10xx.|pg||
nt|rhelle: very - otherwise North would have bid @ds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 20+ years ago it was on in a couple of exceptional situations also...  but it was a real memory problem so it was reduced to only one situation|pg||
nt|lc: I sympathize.  I want nice simple rules -- not many excpetions.|pg||
nt|kit: I agree completely Larry|pg||
nt|lc: Nice result from Hamman-Zia in Closed to make 620 on this deal.  So at best a push for Netherlands.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|bigtrain: yes...  those early years eric was a purist...  he's become much more practical (partly at meck's request) more recently  :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lc: Certainly anything other than another high @C by Meck here would have let declarer claim 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer is trying to figure out if Meck might have @SJ10xx.|pg||
nt|lc: That would give North 7@D.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer now knows 6@cs and 1@h ... so if South has J10xx in @s, North has 7 @ds|pg||
nt|lc: too slow :)|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer also knows he can always make if @DA with North, of course.|pg||
nt|lc: Is there some sure way to make it on any layout?  That is the question -- complicated.|pg||

nt|lc: So, the 9-card fit is 2 tricks worse than the 7-card fit.|pg||
nt|lc: This might make me rethink the Law of Total Tricks :)|pg||
nt|kit: It is the side KQJx of hearts which makes the difference|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like the 4@d opening though|pg||
nt|lc: So, Meckstroth will win USA2 5 IMPs for his conservatism (not a word that is usually in the same sentence as Meckwell).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of people play it as a gadget, but there is a lot to be said for a 4-level preempt|pg||

nt|kit: pretty hard for West to resist I think|pg||
nt|kareno: The Norway match is not being shown now.|pg||
nt|kareno: Folks only five of the eight matches could be shown.|pg||
nt|lc: While West might not pass, he might not drive to 6.  So, we need to know if 5@H will make.|pg||
nt|kit: West has a pretty good idea of what the general hand looks like -- he is trying to mentally play 6@H and see if it makes.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kit: now, will anybody double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|kareno: 6@h a bit high here!!|pg||

nt|kit: actually, on a straight crossruff this might do surprisingly well|pg||
nt|lc: While, high, and while GIB says it is down, it is not quickly obvious that it is down.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart lead would have put paid to it I think.  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Believe me, you will have time to walk your turtle before Muller plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: LOL|pg||
nt|kit: 5 minor suit winners -- can he get 7 trump winners?|pg||
nt|lc: Hard to get to hand to ruff enough @S is the problem.|pg||
nt|lc: As he ruffs minors to hand, North can throw @S.|pg||
nt|kareno: You can get scores on the WBF web page  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Participants.htm|pg||
nt|rhelle: the thing here is, that Muller is somewhat prone to thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and when potentially the match is at stake, guess what he will do?|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the other room it went 2 off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: doubled|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told running scores: BB http://tinyurl.com/lr39ml; VC http://tinyurl.com/m7a4n5 ; Seniors http://tinyurl.com/m64csv|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so still a gain for NL|pg||
nt|lc: So, NETH will gain no matter what.|pg||
nt|kit: I think he can get out for down 1 if he ruffs 2 diamonds and 1 club|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think he's trying to make it|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, as would we all :)|pg||
nt|lc: He doesn't know @H4-1, of course -- so trying to think of a legit line.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is slow, yes ... but also one of Holland's best declarers|pg||
nt|kit: to make it he has to do basically the same thing I think|pg||
nt|lc: The Closed Room auction is amusing (put MOUSE on CLOSED ROOM under the score).|pg||
nt|kit: and if North had 1 more spade and 1 less heart, it probably would make|pg||
nt|rhelle: Huun Bertens tells me that he is THE BEST|pg||
nt|rhelle: and coming from Huub, I'll take that to the bank|pg||
nt|lc: I think N-S were about to play in 3@C X in the Closed Room!|pg||
nt|kit: 10 of hearts doesn't matter I don't think if North has the magic shape -- South follows to everything|pg||
nt|rhelle: And Jan Jansma agrees to - also not to be ignored|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like it for sure.  |pg||
nt|rhelle: One of Holland's juniors told me that when dummy went down he is going to iron a few shirts - he knows he has time :)|pg||
nt|lc: After he walks his turtle.|pg||
nt|kareno: hahaha Larry|pg||
nt|kit: oh, I think you are right that North needs A10x of hearts and the 4-3-3-3 shape -- South will be in position to overruff eventually|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if time limits will be enforced this last set of the match but they do accumulate against pairs don't they?|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, this match has progressed prett well up to now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I think it would be churlish to deny Muller his right to think on such an important hand|pg||
nt|lc: I am generally not tolerant of slow play, but in a situation like this, how can you not take a long time?|pg||
nt|kareno: That would not happen.|pg||
nt|kit: as long as one doesn't waste time with overtricks or other nonsense, taking your time on this sort of hand is fine|pg||
nt|lc: Meck is generally very intolerant -- he might be impatiently looking at his watch every 5 seconds.|pg||
nt|lc: I've seen him do that.|pg||
nt|rhelle: somehow I don't think it's overtricks he's worried about :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have seen someone do that against Simon De Wijs in an English tournament|pg||
nt|lc: And in all fairness, Meck plays quickly -- and is very good about saving time -- will often say as declarer: "don't think long -- just overtricks involved."|pg||
nt|kareno: He needs to be quick - Eric is definitely not.|pg||
nt|rhelle: And so when the opponent started complaining and fidgeting, he just stated that now he stooped thinking|pg||
nt|rhelle: and that when play restarted, he'd start all over again :)|pg||
nt|lc: It can get testy at times when it comes to this issue.|pg||
nt|kareno: Norway now only 6 IMPs down I'm told |pg||
nt|kareno: With four boards to play.|pg||

nt|lc: So, whichever minor he plays, Rod throw @S and dec ruffs and ruffs another @S.|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, I surely cannot reply to you all, sorry.|pg||
nt|lc: Or, will Rodwell do something other than throw a @S -- and can Rodwell figure this all out?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|lc: In the modern age of BBO, what typically is happening now is that the players who finished at the other table will have been told the story.|pg||

nt|kit: defense has 3 diamonds, 3 spades, and a heart easily -- but I guess they will be forced to break hearts eventually and with the jack onside declarer will score 2 heart tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You want to put an end to progress, Karen?|pg||
nt|lc: I suspect that Hamman-Zia are relieved at this point to see the score -- they surely had a skethcy scorecard here  (bds 17, 25,  29 for example).|pg||
nt|lc: Some players refuse to "hear/see" the scoreboard and prefer to wait for their teammates.|pg||
nt|lc: But, it is hard to resist the urge.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|kareno: A partscore pickup for Netherlands and the match gets closer!!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lc: If this makes 3 (140), that will be 6 IMPS and NETH will trail by 11.|pg||

pc|h8|nt|lc: The comparisons go quite quickly:  "+110, win 6,   -50, Lose 10,  etc. " -- nobody looks it up.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: EW likely to now get too high (4S not too bad in theory, but very unmakeable on this lie)|pg||
nt|howiew: Hamman is going to see a lot of bidding before getting around to his hand --- the best at the table|pg||
pc|cK|nt|howiew: 50 per trick again|pg||
nt|sybarra: who can X??? |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||

nt|kareno: There won't be thirteen IMPs on this board, folks.|pg||
nt|lc: Hard to see a gain.|pg||
nt|rhelle: unless they enter and go overboard very badly|pg||
mb|d!|an|majors|nt|rhelle: a swimming pool score|pg||

mb|r!|an|6-8pts|mb|p|nt|kareno: And say that the Dutch team made a very good showing these last days.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|G.F.|nt|tarekr:  Could have been exciting with last board. But it is time for the fat Lady to sing!|pg||

nt|barnets: with a couple of softish boards for usa|pg||
nt|barnets: but  not I think as much as 17|pg||
nt|chip: Netherlads has a good chance to win two more partscore swings on 30 and 31, but probably will then be just short.|pg||
nt|barnets: china beat Norway|pg||
nt|barnets: comeback fell just short|pg||
nt|barnets: lost it on board 31|pg||
nt|howiew: so the match was two boards to long for Norway.|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: all switch to the open now thanks to all the specs and organisers|pg||
nt|howiew: it is very hard to finally take the lead on the 94th or whatever board, only to have it slip away.  so we will have a new champion as Norway was defending the Bermuda Bowl from ...|pg||
nt|howiew: shanghai in 2007.|pg||
