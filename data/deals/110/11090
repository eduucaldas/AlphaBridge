nt|howiew: If south had the spade jack as well, six is cold without the diamond ruff.  |pg||

pc|d3|nt|barnets: best lead|pg||
nt|howiew: Reasonably looking for a 5-4 heart fit, and eschewing the possible 5-3 fit.|pg||
nt|barnets: by zia|pg||
nt|rhelle: sensible approach- with his balanced hand he only wants to go to 4@h if partner has 4 of them|pg||
nt|howiew: Hamman may put in the ten.  If partner has Kxx, it maintains better communication.|pg||
nt|rhelle: he knows the location of the key cards - apart from the @cJ, that is|pg||
nt|rhelle: so declarer may well duck the 10|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|howiew: club lead on an unoposed auction in the other room, making 10 tricks.|pg||

nt|rhelle: it's not easy to combine his chances|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course a throw-in might be possible|pg||
nt|howiew: If either black suit splits he has nine tricks, or Jx of clubs, with possible 9x or 8x of spades with east.|pg||
nt|howiew: A throw in won't work as west will still have the diamond nine as an entry.|pg||
nt|howiew: sorry east.|pg||
nt|howiew: If he ducks the diamond  he has nothing to throw west in with.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|howiew: 9x or 8x with east won;t help, need 9-8 doubleton.|pg||
nt|howiew: Zia should unblock the queen.   The diamond seven should be third best remaining, indicating the T87.|pg||
nt|barnets: even if zia unblocks the Q his @D9 will prevent hamman being thrown in|pg||
nt|barnets: after dec cashes his black winners|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|howiew: Zia is concerned about the throw-in.  He knows he has the nine, but knows Hamman doesn;t know he has the nine.|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|howiew: 5@C will play just fine, and may be better than 3N, especially if played by south.  the diamond ruff is the chief danger in 5@C. |pg||

nt|rhelle: 3NT = hand unsuitable for slam unless responder is very max|pg||
nt|rhelle: no reason why West won't lead a @h, of course|pg||
nt|howiew: So at most tables we have 1N - 3N --- maybe a club slam try thrown in.  On a heart lead, 11 or 12 tricks.|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4NT quantitative - shows 15-16|pg||
nt|howiew: south is pretty minimum for his bidding, if 1C was strong.  was it?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and yes, I know he doesn't have them|pg||
nt|rhelle: hence the 3NT bid, and not 3@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: In my opinion, 4NT is a gross overbid|pg||
nt|howiew: Zia is hoping for an acceptance.|pg||
nt|barnets: 4N is too high|pg||
nt|howiew: I don't know south's range, but north has a great hand if south has some aces.|pg||
nt|barnets: on aspade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think North should realise that South knows this|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is a small twist ... with bids like c@c etc, North could show controls (from 4 onwards)|pg||
nt|rhelle: sorry - 4@cv|pg||
nt|rhelle: so with only 4 controls himself, South should pass, I think|pg||
nt|howiew: Hamman would certainly lead a heart vs. 3N, not sure there is much case for different vs. 4N if it gets passed.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: after super-accept, 3N is some form of slam try  -  not an offer to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kit: and maybe another hand depending on picking up the spade suit missing the queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes and the dutch need to pick it!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: East knows queen of trumps is missing, but at state of match may bid it anyway, since can't be worse than guess as he has J10|pg||
nt|kit: Now, does Meckstroth holding the queen of spades lead his ace?|pg||
nt|kit: Or does that give it away?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just balanced slam try with 4suit shortness|pg||
nt|kit: or not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he will go down - no reason to go anti 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: anti%|pg||
nt|kit: why it it anti.  If he starts spades with the king, it is virtually 50-50|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|kit: a point may be that when South doesn't lead a spade, declarer may infer that South has the queen, since the spade lead seems "safe" on the auction|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 2-2 split is more common especially with no singletons in declarer or dummy's hands|pg||
nt|kit: Which may be why Meckstroth led the ace of clubs -- that he might lead with or without the queen of spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now the never ending question   does @CA imply or deny possible trump trick [or just say I have the ace :) ]|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
