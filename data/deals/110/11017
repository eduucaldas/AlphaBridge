nt|petergill: Not only the routine 2@C overcall, but the non-routine 3@C raise, did the job|pg||
nt|daman: first blood to Italy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria (North) kept on bidding at the other table and the spade game was found.|pg||

nt|petergill: the absence of opener bidding a real suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: yes but N opened 1@D   a bit different|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again South showed weakish with hearts.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: bad splits abound|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 1: Yes, so it was easy for the Italians who opened naturally to reach game, but not so easy for Bulgaria after the strong club|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was unsure whether to raise the clubs or show his spades. Close decision.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The auctions seem similar to me.|pg||
nt|daman: now 2NT by South and N can still show his @Cs|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: South showed about 5-8 with hearts and Lauria had to decide whether to pass or bid 3@S.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C strong 16+ any, then natural|pg||
nt|daman: now South has a clear picture of North's hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|daman: but not so much of his stregth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South knows of the singleton diamond opposite, so may be nervous of 3NT. But he is so minimum he does not like to contemplate an 11-trick club game.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: is 3NT the lesser of 2 evils?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S, 3NT and 5@C = 3 evils|pg||
nt|daman: I would not bid 3NT with A654 of @Ds opposite known shortness|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: I would always take my chances on 5@Cs|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least with the ace you can hold up to void one defender in the suit.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|petergill: @D's are 4/4 but the bad club break, and @SK offside, seems terminal to 3NT's chances|pg||

nt|daman: tilt|pg||
nt|petergill: South gave it some thought before venturing 3NT, I too prefer 3NT (ordinary club pips in mere 8 card @C fit = bad for 5@C) but he was probably considering 4@S very closely. |pg||
nt|daman: the record only gets stuck when the contract is doomed|pg||
mc|7|nt|brolucius: I think there was a double-dummy make if he won the third diamond and led a low spade from his hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: Should declarer have played a low spade at Trick 4? |pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: he had to keep 4 spades in the board, though|pg||
nt|daman: only if he could see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: to get his trick total up to 8|pg||
nt|petergill: That loses disastrously if East has 5@D's and @SK, with clubs friendly|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would then squeeze West in hearts and clubs, but totally double-dummy.|pg||

nt|hedyg: trump lead can beat it, K@H cannot|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a trump lead, North has to win the second diamond and cannot return a trump. But if declarer ruffs 3rd diamond with the @SJ, South makes the @S10.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: on a trump lead he'd have to play for a @d@c squeeze. I don't know whether this is the best line (there is a double squeeze possibility also).|pg||
nt|petergill: On a non trump lead, declarer does not have the entries to set up the long @H if @H's are 4-3, so playing to ruff a @D in dummy works|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading 10 @s of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: yes, trump lead beats it, since South ruffs early|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace led @HK|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests taking J@S on lead and @c finesse for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Totally obvious to lead the @HK, anyway. Only a genius or an idiot would lead a trump.|pg||

nt|sga1: how?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 6: Good point, Hedy, but in reality he would probably play for @d's 4-3 since he can't see through the back of the cards (unlike us)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Seems to need a 2-2 trump break. If the @HQ is singleton, you might have to take a diamond finesse.|pg||
nt|hedyg: of course|pg||
nt|daman: in 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Modified Precision with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: yes, 6 rounds of bidding (starting with 2@c by North, as usual) in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|daman: If you were to play Jacoby   and South showed a singleton @D....would that perk your interest?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West holds @SQ-x-x or @SK-x-x, you need only one ruff, since you can finesse on the first round. OK if he has both honours too. So chances are good if @HQ is singleton. |pg||
nt|hedyg: Norway back in the lead |pg||

mb|2S|nt|hedyg: this is forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: Fulvio is only mid 30's, 35 or 36, about half the age of Bob Hamman (70) |pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: he has to force a @h pitch from south before the endplay, else NS make 2@s and one in each other suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvr: sorry, was supposed to be private ;)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Once spades are raised, it should be a matter of cue-bidding. The auction worked poorly for Bulgaria at the other table. West denied a diamond control and East did not think that ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: his possession of the @DK justified him in going beyond game.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: But West at the other table might well have made one more try, looking for a diamond control at the five-level.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|petergill: I think: 3@S set spades, then they cue bid ast or 2nd round controls, I'm not sure why Fulvio bid 5@C not 5@D|pg||

nt|petergill: I think, as Paolo Brum our operator pointed out in part, showed @DK by inference and @CA (5@C, would bid 5@D if @CK) and no other key cards. |pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this exiting match|pg||
nt|daman: most people cannot spell slavinsky so it would be difficult to write it properly on their card|pg||
nt|vugraphzvr: they key to figuring those leads out is for the defender to identify whether his pd has an honor in the suit or not. (Usually not so tough)|pg||

nt|hedyg: exciting*|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland - you are right - I have difficulty even writing down what Slavinsky Leads are, let alone playing them.  |pg||
