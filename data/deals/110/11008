nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators in this room are David Bird, Ray Lee and Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers! Another great match for us to watch.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am Roland Wald|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi ro and the fellas|pg||
nt|buffytvs: It's an MPP commentary team! :)  Hi Jan and David.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: excactly, hi as well to ray and david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi Ray. I am already exhausted after watching the match between Italy and Norway this afternoon. Full of meaty deals, scarcely a dud part-score there. |pg||
nt|imp_jan: nl at 5th and usa2 at 8th place|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I watched India and Russia swing well over 100 IMPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have noted that Meckstroth-Rodwell seem to be opening most 10-counts in this championship, so I guess East will bid 1@H (despite the @SQ-J not pulling much weight). |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I also saw a passout yesterday -- very rare sighting these days|pg||
nt|buffytvs: MR are always very aggressive|pg||
nt|brolucius: By US standards in the 1940s that East hand is about half a mile short of an opening bid.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly not up to Al Roth's standrads|pg||
nt|imp_jan: kinda Muiderberg|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 5-10 hcp, 5crd @h + minor|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, Al Roth must have been some cardplayer, because I have never understood or admired his ideas about bidding. He did well, of course. |pg||
nt|buffytvs: LOL - Jan's just finished writing a book for us on Muiderberg 2's :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wldnt be a success here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think that generation grew up as rubber bridge players -- great cardplayers all|pg||
nt|imp_jan: actualy north has such a plaything as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: let's goo|pg||
nt|imp_jan: too ugly though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Al Roth invented the negative double, if I remember rightly - a huge contribution to the game.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: correct|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|imp_jan: heart spots might bring declarer home|pg||
nt|brolucius: I hope that the barrel of big hands was not emptied in this afternoon's session.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's always action with Meckwell anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: give them time|pg||
nt|brolucius: Watching them defend 1NT is not my idea of 'action'.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: patience, grasshopper :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the Good Lord had intended me to be patient, he would have given me some patience.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: back to the monastery for more meditation then...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I understand that 'down below' they do not allow the bidding to advance beyond 1NT.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose delcarer takes in dummy and advances @HQ (east shldnt duck ofcourse)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: shld i mean :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you're determined to make us discuss this deal, Jan...|pg||

nt|buffytvs: East is a bit embarrassed for discards here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes kind a squeezed|pg||
nt|brolucius: A barrage of kibitzers explain that North's 1@S showed five, because they play some unmentionable convention beginning with 'F'. Oh dear.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: They do?  For shame...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least all present in this room know better than to mention the convention by name (which might lure others down that unfortunate path).|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think if declarer ducks the spade he makes the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Regarded by Reese as the worst convention every invented.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well we can see the endplay now|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but does declarer see it?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvv: rodwell  play the 8 of @d |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, but at least we know exactly what happened. He eliminated the black suits and played a diamond to the king, ducked by North, who then took the next two diamond tricks. Well ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: defended.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: good play on both sides really.  Meckwell got to a good but unlucky slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: it was not the case|pg||
nt|brolucius: Light opening by Meckstroth. 10 points fewer than normal.|pg||
nt|lml: and the Dutch defended well|pg||
nt|lml: cant ask for more than that as a viewer of a world championships|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hope they can avoid 7@c |pg||
nt|buffytvs: this time MR may keep the Dutch out of a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: bertens doesn't duck , but after the ace , he played an other @d|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1. The score is not 81-54|pg||
nt|Zmud99: yes i will try to fix it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so declarer misguessed the diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2. No countries|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told the spectacular news: North took the ace played a @D back - declarer played the 8 instead of the 10|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, what a defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: What a huge number of IMPs depended on that!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He played the @D8 because he could not believe North would defend that way with @DA-J-x.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Menahwile, one of Meckstroth's better opening bids has happened here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvv: and rodwell took the bad card (the 8 instead of the 10 )|pg||
pc|h5|mc|11|nt|buffytvs: so the psyche did keep NS out of 6@C and USA retake the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Right let's see how they deal with the psyche. Well, we are being shown the result, not the whole auction - after the crash. |pg||
nt|brolucius: E-W were in the bidding at the other table too, so they did well to bid 6@C there.|pg||
