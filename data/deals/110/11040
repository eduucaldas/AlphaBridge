nt|Walddk2: also welcome to Bart Bramley|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Bart|pg||
nt|fred: Bob Hamman can't be too happy with his first hand of this match|pg||
nt|fred: Bob is a die hard 4-card majors man|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|fred: you can bet it pains him to have to open 1@D with 4432 shape, especially with all of his strength in the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean it hurts to open 1@D? :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: it hurts him|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|fred: right - he plays 5-card majors with Zia, but that is not his system of choice|pg||
nt|bbramley: it's painful even for diehard 5-card majorites to open 1@D on three small|pg||
nt|fred: maybe this hand will get him to reconsider - not so easy for the opps to find their best fit once hamman opens 1@D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fred: well done|pg||

nt|fred: ravenna's delayed entry into the auction suggests some length in diamonds, so maybe it is possible for pellegrini to bid 3@D, but much easier with all the cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S might have been the lesser of 2 evils in his view|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|bbramley: punting with 2@S on a 3-bagger is almost "standard", when the alternative is a scary 4-bagger at the 3-level|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fred: agree|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: defending 2@S is their best possible result|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|fred: what do you think of Ravenna's DBL? Not sure I would have done that with only 3 spades and the Q of hearts a questionable value|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|bbramley: south might have saved himself by overcalling 1NT initially|pg||

mb|p|nt|fred: 4@H also has some play but requires more luck than 5@C|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D must be a misclick|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bbramley: i suppose he was catering to declarer being 3-2 in the minors instead of 2-3 - that would kill the pitches|pg||
nt|fred: 2@D is the Flannery convention - 5@H, 4@S and roughly 11-15 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I can't believe they are allowed to play the F-convention|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: Roland's favorite convention|pg||
nt|fred: back when i started playing bridge (1980s) Flannery was quite popular in North America|pg||
nt|fred: you don't see it much these days, but there are obviously still some very strong players who believe in it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: Flannery is banned in Denmark|pg||
nt|bbramley: i play it with partners who are willing - also levin-weinstein and a few other pairs|pg||
nt|fred: i am sort of neutral. i can see the benefits of Flannery, but i like weak 2@D and tend to play that unless my partners really want to play something else|pg||

nt|bbramley: low from KQJ is occasionally indicated, but there would be no reason for it here|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|bbramley: i think this board will be a push|pg||
nt|daman: Hamman is finessing    guaranteed|pg||
