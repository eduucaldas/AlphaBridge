nt|vugraphzwc: spades 3-3 and @Dk well placed, 6N seems cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: dont know if they should bid it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The German pair play a strong club system with a mini no-trump|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So North has shown a balanced 13-14|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is a pretty horrible slam, in spite of the 32 points|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I am not sure I like this sequence, but I have a feeling they will eventually land in slam|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure they know what they are doing, and will stay out....|pg||
nt|gulyas: they are only a pointed jack away from a laydown slam, its hard to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it will all be in note 47 of their Convention card :)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|gulyas: but the points are there, so they should be in it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh well, it is better to be lucky...|pg||
nt|sastro: lets hope for an interesting match Germany - Egypt (one of my favorite countrys where I live every year for 2 month in Wintertime ) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: the info i am entering in the bidding i received from arnim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|cuttysark: it will be correct then|pg||
nt|sharynr: So someone maybe missorted diamonds and hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: any more to the play than leading a small diamond to the queen?|pg||
nt|gulyas: yeah, and then test the suits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can't see past trying that, then looking for a 3-3 break somewhere|pg||
nt|gulyas: not a great slam, but I had worse:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: if the @DQ wins, duck a @D and cash out... what would be the better squeeze position?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||

nt|sastro: after sorting out all sqeeze possibilyties Sabine will come to the conclusion to make the @D expass.....|pg||
nt|gulyas: interestingly, CR missed this slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: now i think is better to duck a @D and play for a double squeeze with @c AS CENTRAL SUIT|pg||

nt|vugraphzwc: happy when spades 3-3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think Egypt can consider themselves unlucky here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwc: or if west holds @D and east holds @S, then no one holds clubs at the end|pg||
nt|gulyas: the @S10 now makes her think|pg||
nt|sastro: biside of finding the @S 3-3 she has now a simple squeeze against W - knowing that she has the @D king|pg||
nt|gulyas: can she make it if W controls both pointed suits?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was a veryinetresting hand card play wise|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: extremely|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i doubt many would find that play Marshall|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: me neither:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: but in any case winning first club in hand was clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: then probably king of diamonds if not a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: this chicken has a better chance of making it home toroost|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: maybe not on this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course south warned off leading hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: "warned off" makes it sound like avoiding that lead is a good thing|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double spade duck gets 3N home|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i think the 7 hearts comes into its own as a long term additional stop|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: adouble duck works wonders thats how the advert used to go|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gulyas: it was an entertaining match, with lots of swings to be sure|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Interesting lead - decalrer unlikely to play you for @HQ unless artner shows out|pg||
nt|gulyas: kib points out that ducking @Ss twice lets you make 3NT last board, as S will have no more of them to play after that, and declarer cannot be attacked anywhere else either|pg||
nt|sharynr: made in CR when spade spots collided|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We have an excellent class of kibitzer here - maybe they should take over :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharynr: An alternate line on last hand would be to play @H3-3 and @C queen onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 100 IMPs in 15 boarts. amazing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: In other room contract and suit led were the same. E hastened to her doom by winning the first trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on previous board i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this isnt easy with the bad trump split|pg||

nt|marlowepi: jack not a good diamond to play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now spade to hand and club jack. if N had the ace hshe might fear singleton and rise, as diamond jack by S at second trick suggests W is 5431. tht would take a guess away if W had ...|pg||
