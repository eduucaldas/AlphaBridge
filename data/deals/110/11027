nt|hedyg: i would want to play in @D|pg||
nt|ndemirev: likely 5d with the double fit :)|pg||

nt|joest: hiding eight card suits often does not work well|pg||
nt|daman: why tell pard?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|d|an|shows minimum, pass would be forcing|mb|p|nt|hedyg: just forget the @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: you have no defense vs @hs|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 4S could make when 5D doesnt|pg||
nt|joest: Interestingly Meckwell's card is marked that 3@h (overcall) over 1@s = 'strong'|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: when you are ruffing @H with Q9x?|pg||
nt|ndemirev: in case S had a 4S bid himself |pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: NS play the normal forcing pass treatment i think, so Duboin's double was not suggesting they bid on|pg||
nt|joest: interestig that the Italians would think themselves in a forcing auction over 4@h|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ndemirev: I dont think this is FP situation here |pg||
nt|joest: it's not the 3@d bidder I"m worried about|pg||
nt|daman: it is if 3@D says it's their hand|pg||
nt|joest: it's the fact that the opener feels compelled to do something|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: now Meckstroth on lead knows that declarer has four spades|pg||
nt|ndemirev: won't change much the outcome |pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he will choose @H10, or even a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: on board 3 Hamman just jumped to 5@d over 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: and was doubled|pg||
nt|athene: Rodwell didn't have a weak-2@D opener available|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 3 5@D X in OR|pg||
nt|athene: so it's possible Meckstroth will play him for good diamonds |pg||
nt|athene: (he didn't double 3@C so a club lead is less likely)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: Hamman bid 5@d directly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: may lead D - the likely long suit in pd's hand |pg||

nt|hedyg: what*|pg||
mb|5C!|an|no!s cue, odd number of KC|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: 6@C could have been beaten on a @D ruff|pg||
nt|joest: they hit the brakes just in the nick of time|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: specs thought they should have gone on|pg||
nt|ndemirev: they seem to have misunderstanding here |pg||
nt|joest: 4@c is a bit aggressive?  Maybe not.|pg||
nt|athene: 4NT over 4@H would have been turbo (even number of keycards)|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian contract compared to 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: interesting that rodwell goes for his own ruff, not his partner's|pg||
nt|athene: given that he has the entry|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he is hoping for a VOID diamond opposite|pg||
nt|athene: surely not?|pg||
nt|daman: only in game   in slam he would have given his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: he knows north is 4-4 blacks and south is 4-4 rounds|pg||
nt|ndemirev: probably S hand could have been teh like of  x Qxxx AKx QJxxx for this bidding where Sementa had to complete to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hamman played himself down in 5@d but Lauria did not realise and gave him the game back|pg||
nt|athene: so i suppose it's possible they could be 3-3 diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: first blodd to USA2|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: 4-4 unlikely given how many rodwell has|pg||
nt|hedyg: he played @s before @d but opps never guessed he had 3 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: so no ruff|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell's idea, i am sure, was win @CA and lead @D10 for a rollicking defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: and even if he didn't get the brass ring like that, the spade lead might well be ok, setting up partner's @SK perhaps|pg||

nt|athene: as the cards lie nothing works|pg||
nt|daman: if Fantoni/Nunes were playing they would still be on Board 2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|athene: this hand does actually illustrate one point which is that shortage in your partner's first-bid suit (as rodwell has here) isn't actually much of an asset, most of the time|pg||
nt|athene: so if you just use losing-trick-count aggressively on these hands you can end up quite high|pg||
nt|ndemirev: there is a completet crossruff availbale provided no overruff by @H Q|pg||
nt|joest: problem with complete cross ruff is that someone gets to pitch a spade on the fourth diamond, even if spades 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if Meckstroth is thinking that the lack of trump switch suggests the crossruff WON'T work|pg||
nt|joest: of course if they lack the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: north is less likely to switch to a trump if he can see he has the potential to over-ruff in spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1 with crossruff in OR|pg||
nt|joest: hooking the diamond seems % but I can't prove it|pg||

nt|joest: I have no idea what Rod knows about Jeff's clubs|pg||
nt|daman: with 5 he might have bid over the double|pg||

nt|athene: but, from the 3@S rebid, he knows there is no spade ruff in his hand for the 12th|pg||
nt|joest: and that assumes the queen of hearts comes home|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|100dog: sì|pg||

nt|100dog: ha giocato le massime chance|pg||
mc|11|nt|rcerreto: sì, QJx a @c non riesci a giocarli|pg||
nt|gluckenval: gli manca poi un ingresso ? Possibile|pg||
nt|100dog: sì|pg||
nt|100dog: se provi le fiori perdi la possibilità del pezzo secondo di @D dentro|pg||
nt|100dog: che è superiore s QJ terzo di fiori|pg||
nt|rialc2: adesso salta fuori che era un buon slam|pg||
nt|cuan: a quadri con la 3-3 o un pezzo secco o secondo trovi lo scarto per la picche tirando in testa|pg||
nt|gluckenval: era di battuta :)|pg||
nt|100dog: ma tirando in testa perdi con QJ quarti dentro|pg||
nt|100dog: fidatevi che ha giocato giusto :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: alternativa... A@D e @D verso il 10.....|pg||
nt|100dog: prendete l'enciclopedia del bridge e studiate :)|pg||

nt|ndemirev: good defence , not much hope with 4-1 break |pg||
nt|joest: perhaps convincing Sementa that hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|joest: he's afraid to take the tap in his hand if hearts are indeed 4-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe Duboin would have bid 3@s if Meck passed and they would have found 4@H anyhow|pg||
