mb|2H|nt|benjent: Interesting choice, a @d lead. If you're going to make an attacking lead, I would say make the one that has a more direct upside (ie, lead a @h)|pg||

mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|benjent: Aronov-Stefanov are playing precision, so 1@s is 10-15. Actually, their card seems to have a hole for 16. I guess they choose between 1@c and 1-something-else|pg||
nt|gowdy: not possible to sell this hand under 5 @S|pg||

nt|benjent: @c was a long way from EW's most effective lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gowdy: Chagas's choice of 3@S in the closed is  " interesting as well|pg||
nt|benjent: Best now is probably to accept his fate and set up @d. Getting one ruffed is ok for him, because it shortens West's trumps.|pg||

nt|benjent: Nifty @hQ by Aronov, by the way. Try to make it look like he has an honour to go with it - maybe scare one of the opponents off continuing them later|pg||
nt|benjent: Now Aronov is probably still best off plugging away with a @d - a low one|pg||

nt|benjent: 5@c should go down, especially on that lead, so this should be 11 imps to Brazil|pg||
nt|skorchev: Villas Boas pressure paid off|pg||
nt|benjent: Yep, V-B had faith in his partner's vulnerable 2@s and popped in a tough 4@d bid. Nice work.|pg||

nt|skorchev: one down mean 44:36 and if I remembered well from 3 to 8 IMPs defference converts to 16:14 VPs|pg||
