mb|5D|mb|p|nt|flash: in addition, the 1st-place finisher gets to 'set the brackets' by sending two of the top 4 teams to the other side of the bracket|pg||

nt|flash: 5@D a practical call?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Often not helpful to get these choices - big headache|pg||
nt|afulton: At the other table on this hand, West bid 5@h which south doubled ... making it the final contract|pg||
nt|flash: and, curiously enough, a large proportion of the choices seem to backfire|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Yes - even the big carryover does not always help|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Opposition spurred into playing well because they have been selected as the team you think you can beat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|flash: (if USA 1 recovers to finish in the top 8, the Conditions of Contest mandate that the 2 USA squads must play in either the Quarter-Finals or the Semi-Finals)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Better than the inaccurate slips of paper we used to have :)|pg||
nt|mug: will David Price bid a straight 3@D, or double intending to convert clubs to diamonds?|pg||
nt|afulton: Or the non-recording of many years ago|pg||
nt|flash: in Shanghai, they introduced a Recorder Mode - the auction, opening lead and play was recorded (to the extent the operator could follow it)|pg||
nt|flash: a gold-mine of data for journalists and statistics geeks|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Must consfes I would double to get hearts into the game|pg||
mb|3S|nt|flash: i'm reasonably sure they've since gone back to just the contract and the result|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|afulton: wooohoo|pg||
nt|afulton: not what I expected!|pg||
nt|mug: the problem with the equal-level conversion approach is that often the opponents force partner to bid clubs higher than three|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mug: 5@H is a poor contract, but he can make it on this layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I suppose Simpson did not want to emphasise his hearts at the expense of his clubs, but it looks like a missed opportunity|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|flash: the lay-out of the trump suit will give a final swing to England, narrowing the gap|pg||
nt|afulton: Well, i am looking at winners and losers... assume he wins this... what are south's winners? |pg||
nt|mug: that will be 11 IMPs to England, and 13 or 14 VPs|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, if i am slow with this one... |pg||
nt|mug: he just ruffs the second spade and plays a heart to the jack|pg||
nt|flash: despite the profusion of flat boards, it's been an entertaining and well-played match|pg||
nt|mug: if they play a third spade he ruffs it in dummy, to save the @H9|pg||

nt|afulton: He leads a @h to J and East ducks... |pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|mug: just continues with @HK bringing down the queen|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: 6 IMPs is 16-14...   so England will retain the top spot|pg||
nt|mug: @HQ was a good card but still, returns on a club and plays a small heart up|pg||
nt|mug: @HQ could be @HAQ or @HQ10|pg||
nt|mug: Simpson needs to be aware now|pg||
