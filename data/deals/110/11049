mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: just needs to avoid a @c ruff|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@D is better than 6@C for two reasons. There might be a diamond ruff in a club contract, and as it is here it's better to have nine trumps between you than eight|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I might be wrong ... excuse me, will look it up|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: are relays and 5-0-4-4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: after a series of relays North will know South's exact hand and select 6 diamonds- sometimes at the end of the relay the bidding has gone past the last safe spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: from south|pg||
nt|capercliff: important for Holland as well I suppose, only 8VP's ahead currently|pg||
nt|rhelle: ok, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: welcome|pg||
nt|mariner1: Ariane Toledo (Brazil) is our superb operator, Hi Ariane!|pg||
nt|rhelle: apologies - 3@c shows the 5=0=4=4 distribuion|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Hello Mariner1 thanks!!!! :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 diamonds definitely best - needs to find out about 2 of spade ace and club ak and d ace-or all 3 for grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: thanks rhelle!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: Hey Rob|pg||
nt|rhelle: right - at the moment North knows South's exact distribution|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rob H - how do they proceed now - in particular how do they distinguish the black kings|pg||
mb|3D|an|relay|mb|p|nt|rhelle: my guess is that North will bid 3@d, asking for controls. South will indicate 5 of them|pg||
mb|4C|an|5 controls -> A=2 ; K=1|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@D setting trumps?|pg||
nt|rhelle: i.e. 2 Aces (2*2) and a King (1*1)|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: and Now North, knowing that this must be 2 aces and a king get enthousiastic|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they ask for number of controls then denial cue bidding|pg||
nt|rhelle: North has room to manoever until 5@d, so he is just checking what he can find out - he's afraid for wasted @s values|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now needs to know which king- knows 2 aces and 1 king|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: yes, indeed|pg||
mb|4S|an|A or K !s no A or K !d|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@d asks|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 4@S denies K@S?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s show a @s card, and not a @d card (A or K)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so now 6D|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, now he needs to guess|pg||
nt|rhelle: he knows South has the @c Ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i think it denies according to my informer|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: but South can still have either the @cK or the @sK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hi Victor and Rob |pg||

nt|rhelle: and he didn't have rtoom to find that out|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm something went wrong|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over weak - and weaker NT  South needed a way to also say "i have decent hand"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See? We have already caught the closed room although they started 15 minutes earlier|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: North is in 2@C next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  (1NT)  2@C  all pass|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|d|nt|jallerton: The Dutch auction would have taken a lot longer on board 2 - it took 6 rounds!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to ask if anybody would overcall 1N -- obviously at least one PLAYER|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = @c I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: red card itis|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: i've seen auctions where player(s) run out of PASS cards -- but don't recall using all DBL|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jallerton: 1NT overcall looks perfectly reasonable to me.  The problem with double is that partner will often bid 2@c when 1NT is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be hairy|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT is Raptor for EW I am told, that explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: recent big event winner Jan Jansma points out that Brink could NOT overcall 1N -- EW play Raptor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 1N would be 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: this will more than compensate for the 1 imp on the first board|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT would have needed an inspired play in hearts to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead 1/3/5   upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|jallerton: Still 4@cX has a chance of making|pg||
nt|jallerton: with the ruffing finesse in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA, @SA, @H ruff @SQ looks like best start|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jallerton: North managed 9 tricks in 2@c in the other room, but his target was only 8!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @S used to pull trump|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: what a difference having South declarer|pg||
nt|jallerton: Spec suggests that this was a poor double, but I suspect pass would be forcing once they have bid 3NT at this vuln |pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|cK|nt|jallerton: Perhaps a bad hand for Raptor, EW bid to game on a combined 22-count.  That was the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just imagine South hand without @SJ or doubleton @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: with a 52333 shape South might not have jumped to 3@c|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5233 sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) well luck goes with the silver - argentina will have a huge swing|pg||

nt|mariner1: part score hand here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It was disappointing that a system as sophisticated as the Tarzan Club used by de Wijs-Muller in the closed room could not spot the grand slam. Muller just punted 6NT over 4@S|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: does 6@C show specifically @CK|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jallerton: If 6@c shows the K South can count 13 almost - just needs @s to break and to find a home for the 4th heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 3@H is game force -- there is room for opener to show many different hands|pg||

nt|rhelle: if it goes off ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: 7@c as it happens is the best place, but that wont be bid I think|pg||

nt|rhelle: and a few @s of course|pg||

nt|rhelle: man, what a session|pg||
nt|lestergold: you mean hope that n/s will either fail to bid the slam or bid one too many!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well neither would surprise us today|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: sorry guys they stop to drink water and go to the toilet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: grand on finesse will cost somebody|pg||
nt|capercliff: prepare for lots of relays......im going to get coffee:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a really tough to bid grand though|pg||
nt|lestergold: just stick to a need to know basis please!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: the best time to go|pg||
nt|lestergold: its eventuffer to make|pg||
nt|capercliff: this auction will take 12 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: they are sitting|pg||
nt|rhelle: at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: down|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: here we go|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT = 12.5 - 15, so I predict he'll open that|pg||
nt|odysseus69: an alert kibitzer has pointed out that 7S is on|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a dim lead played by zsouth |pg||
nt|odysseus69: super Moysian|pg||
mb|2D|an|transfer|nt|lestergold: oh yes 7s wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4C maybe|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@d seems obvious now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is an excellent call as it shows a control and tells S that N has great @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no relay - just bidding their cards- not fair on Argentina|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think mega stroth would find 7 spades even in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South now huge|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, he is super max, with lots of controls|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rhelle: no wasted values in @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear Brazil bid the grand against Italy|pg||
nt|Zmud99: me too :) - you know what Fernanda ask me to be caddy !|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem, is the wasted q dims hah|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Zmud99: Sorry folks suppose to be private|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: it happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after all the fantasy n/s have landed sensibly |pg||
nt|rhelle: North wants to make sure he doesn't miss another slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no more accidents - declarer will be happy when he finds the d king with West|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its the xseonc gran sl;am they missed but this one more forgiveable|pg||
nt|capercliff: not too many rounds of bidding, 1N thwarted any relays I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: second i believe|pg||
nt|mariner1: Herve you can caddy for us too :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 7@S can be made in the 4-2 fit by ruffing a club in dummy. Not surprisingly, no pair in any field has bid 7@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: this isn't rally a grand; you can only get there if South opens 1@c|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Sure Rob :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: im talking about the 7s grand|pg||
nt|mariner1: now Germany in 7th and China in 8th as Argentina is 9th|pg||
nt|rhelle: because South could find out about the AQ bare in @s; but it takes a serious amount of imagination to then visualise the grand in @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: told Norway is on 7@H here|pg||
nt|capercliff: if anyone were to bid 7@s, they would be accused of seeing the hand records|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how about a 1 spade opening- 4 card majors still live|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzvq: wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mexico is beating Norway and is in 6@H here so will extend their lead|pg||
mc|13|nt|lestergold: well north may have tried a second club cue to shout that the splinter was a void and that may would push a lot of south's to bi seven especially those that needed the imps|pg||

nt|jallerton: good claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we didn't talk about it - but super-accept with only 3@H not done with most pairs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially if west opens 2@H or equivalent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have seen a few accidents for the defence against 3NT on a club lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: poor result for holland in the other room |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: The delay is because of a TD call, probably about the previous board|pg||

nt|petergill: Italy leads the event by 0,25 VP from Russia, due to Norway with one board to go trailing 9-21 VPs to last -placed Mexico, who have not won a match until now. |pg||
