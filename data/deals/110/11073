nt|lc: I'll let you explain all their bids.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: indeed :)|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: I'll work on deciphering Hamman-Zia.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: well i actually don't know it that well |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: I can tell you that 1NT was supposedly 15-17 (maybe a good 14).|pg||
nt|lc: Hamman starts out with quite an upgrade.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lc: I think he knew that 1NT would have some preemptive effect.  It is very in-fashion to open 1NT whenever possible.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|lc: It doesn't hurt to declarer as Hamman does, either :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|lc: Nice choice for declarer -- he could work on any of the 4 suits at trick 2 -- quite unsuaul!|pg||
nt|lc: He has every suit double stopped.|pg||
nt|lc: Yet no tricks.|pg||
nt|lc: We can see him getting the 1@S, 2@H 2@D and 2@C ...|pg||
nt|lc: The question is, will he get an 8th trick.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: hi everyone from Sao Paulo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: Hi Ray --  hope you have learned some Porugues there.|pg||

nt|buffytvs: haven't been outside the hotel yet :(|pg||
nt|lc: Fred needs to get spell-check into this BBO thing.|pg||
nt|lc: It would be easier if they just spoke Spanish there, I can spell that.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, we are in the midst of a complex 2NT.  I am looking at all 4 hands and don't know who to PLAy or DEFEND!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|lc: All sorts of entry issues.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lc: The fact that the @S9 came up at trick 1 makes life a bit easier for declarer.|pg||
nt|lc: Again, Hamman can work on any suit -- and doesn't know quite what to do.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lc: Without a camera, we can all be sure Hamman is in his usual pose.  Strong concentration. No facial expressions at all.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose best defense was to work on @C earlier and set up 2@C and AK-A-A for defense.|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I had lunch with Bobby Wolff who said he thought the 8 BB qualifiers were probably the strongest ever -- very hard to pick a winner|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lc: I know -- if you clicked "GIB" we saw this hand go back and forth many times -- but I refuse to talk about double-dummy --  no need to tell me "If West won @HA, etc... -- they see ...|pg||
nt|lc: only 26 cards).|pg||

nt|lc: Very strong field of 8.|pg||
nt|lc: East will surely preempt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lc: Dealer FAV --  go for it!|pg||
nt|lc: And he went high.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I like it|pg||
nt|lc: I know it looks extreme to open 3, but like I said -- FAVORABLE -- players like to put on max pressure.|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|nt|lc: Zia makes a very bold double.|pg||
nt|lc: I would find the level too high for my liking and have passed Zia's hand.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: This dutch pair is known for their high level of pressure putting on the opponents (and themselves sometimes...)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: do you oike 5@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Not really liking 5@S, no.|pg||
nt|lc: Not sure what the need was to bid 5.  4 was likely to buy it, maybe even doubled -- and I could always be pushed to 5.|pg||
nt|lc: It is possible, though, that this sets up a force for N-S.  Some pairs have discussed that this auction is actually forcing.|pg||
nt|lc: But, I doubt N-S have this agreement.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: NS can make 5@D, though it's not a great contract|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: opponents being probably 1-0 in @S don't give you 4@S doubled|pg||
nt|lc: Zia thinking maykes me thinks he thinks it is forcing.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bobdrijver: very likely to just get passed out|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he was thinking about whether it was forcing :)|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: esp with zia and hamman|pg||
nt|lc: Well, the good news for E-W is that even 4@S fails -- so no big deal to suffer an extra 50.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lc: This is modern bridge for you.  You hold the West hand, partner opens 3@S, and you can't even make that!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobdrijver: 5@S is a bolt bid, but doesn't seem that strange to me|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: hehe |pg||
nt|lc: I certainly understand 5@S.  Just think I would have bid 4 -- and then 5 if neccessray.|pg||
nt|lc: This worked better, as not doubled.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on the bidding, though, Zia rates to have the @hK, which to me m akes 5@S less attractive -- you may have lots of defense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobdrijver: indeed west might be too strong to think opponents can make that much, and it is wishfull thinking they will bid a lot|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lc: I would expect to beat any game with West hand, that is why I would have bid only 4@S.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lc: But, as Ray said, 5@D is a make N-S.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

mb|2S|nt|barnets: here in open east opened 3@S south x and west bid 5@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|gosia: 5?|pg||
nt|barnets: which was passed to south|pg||
nt|barnets: zia who is still thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: zia passed|pg||
nt|barnets: so 5@S is the final contract|pg||
nt|kit: rather clever 5@S call -- most opponents would play that creates a force, which is what West wants (to be doubled, that is)|pg||
nt|barnets: hamman would maybe have thought his pass was forcing|pg||
nt|gosia: and go minus instead of plus :)|pg||

nt|lc: Not Hamman's style to open the North hand.|pg||
nt|lc: But surely, at some tables North will act 3rd seat fav.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Let's see if Bob is loosening up at the age of 70.|pg||
nt|lc: approximately -- he might be "only" 69.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 1ha by north? :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: would Hamman maye bid on the basis that he expects them toin the other room?|pg||
nt|lc: I think Hamman tends to stick to his own style -- not duplicate other room.|pg||
nt|lc: But in other room, I expect the Dutch North will do something fun in 3rd seat Fav.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 4@S  X played at the other table|pg||
nt|lc: Zia might open North hand 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|lc: 4@S X presumably on previous board -- right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|lc: 2@C is "any GF"|pg||
nt|lc: Conv card here:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/netherlands/brink-drijver.pdf|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Spades lie very well for EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|lc: 2@D is a "relay"|pg||
nt|lc: 3@S is not on their card -- must be one of those bids that rarely comes up.|pg||
nt|lc: Presumably it shows @S and something else -- let's see if they are on the same wavelenght.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|lc: A bid such as this is likely to have never come up before, so it can cause a problem unless both players remember their notes.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: i am not sure but i think it may already show @D.. at least it used to |pg||
nt|vugraphzwb: 6 @d and 4@s or more|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|daman: running scores      http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/SaoPaulo.09/Results.htm|pg||
nt|lc: It seems as if West expects @D.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so diamonds are now agreed|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: thanks cecilla|pg||
nt|lc: Now, maybe BW to 6@S, a poor contract that makes on the very lucky @S lie.|pg||
nt|lc: BW to 6@D I meant.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobdrijver: 4NT here is one of their "tools"  :  Optional blackwood|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hard to find out whch major queen West has|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: From East's point of view, West could have @Sxx -- also good.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: So, a lucky result coming for the Dutch here.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: with a minimum/no interest Brink would have bid 5@D whatever his keycards, and the rest is "normall" |pg||
nt|lc: So, 5@C showed 1 Keycard and interest?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: fortunate to make this contract indeed|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: correct|pg||
nt|lc: Switch West's majors and 6@D is a great spot.  East had no way to know.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lc: Their own gadget preempted them from finding out what a poor slam this is.|pg||
nt|lc: Meckwell, will likely face a @H preempt from North, then more from South -- and also be guessing.|pg||
nt|lc: I hear 6@D at other table.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Will find out auction soon at other table.|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobdrijver: 5@H doubled at the other table|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||

nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|lc: But, he had better be careful to keep enough trumps to handle the actual layout!|pg||
nt|lc: Now, @SAK and a @H exit wouldn't do any good anyway (unless the @S miracle is in).|pg||
nt|lc: Hamman must be sick as he looks at his @S and dummy's.|pg||
nt|lc: I don't see that Drijver can find a way to mess up this spectacularly lucky layout, but...|pg||

mb|5H|nt|kit: If East finds his partner has an ace, it is pretty difficult for him not to bid slam -- why should his partner hold three small spades|pg||
nt|barnets: hamman not wishing to open the n hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h? 5@h? 6@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: and this time his partner doesn't quite hold three small spades|pg||

nt|lc: Yes, it is common.  That is how Berk-and-I play it.|pg||
nt|lc: 4@D would be a fit -- not a splinter.|pg||
nt|lc: Important to know which -- for sure.  Discuss with your partner!|pg||

nt|bobdrijver: and they should|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|bobdrijver: hamman has a difficult hand here, little bit much for 1NT but what else to bid|pg||
nt|lc: 1NT by Hamman allowing for partner's light overcall style at FAV.|pg||
nt|lc: Hammn has great cards now for partner.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lc: Best game is surely 4@S N-S.|pg||
nt|lc: Hamman may just bid it.|pg||
nt|lc: Or, he could bid 3@H to involve partner more.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Surely, Hamman will make a move towards game.|pg||
nt|lc: But, that won't do it.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lc: 4@S would have been interesting, but looks problematic.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lc: Prob against 4@S would have been @H lead, then maybe @C tapping dummy.  Looks like too many tricks to lose to make 4@S.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 4@S seems chanceless|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: Meanwhile, 4@D looks chanceful:)|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: north chose 2@H instead of 1NT in the closed room, making east bid 3@C and less room for south to introduce the @D , west bought the hand in 4@C |pg||
nt|lc: 4@C presumably -1.|pg||
nt|lc: So, USA2 will win 1 IMP for likely 130 here.|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s playing 4@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Ive been told 2N by Meckstroth would be the opposite of good/bad 2N; so the direct 3@c call shows a minimum hand|pg||
nt|gosia: win an IMP|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: the method Phil refers to is called "weak must speak"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gosia: I like that - but I think Kit likes the opposite ?|pg||
nt|barnets: the bad spade break dooms any chance of 4@S making n/s|pg||
nt|kit: correct -- we use 2NT for the bad hand -- we feel with the good hand it is important to show what we have immediately in case of competition|pg||
nt|phil: is the @h Q a smart card? if Simon played the K, it would alert a sleepy pard about the spade shift|pg||
nt|barnets: hamman north bid 1n over 1@S and raised zias 2@D bid to the 4 level|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: arguably North would never play the K from any holding|pg||
nt|barnets: and zia was allowed to make 11 tricks in diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|lc: Anyway, I suspect 5@H expressed desire to be in slam with control in the 4th suit.|pg||

nt|rhelle: 1@h = 9+ and 4+@s, unbalanced|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|barnets: looking for @D control|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kit: oh dear -- they just wrongsided it|pg||
nt|rhelle: they switch @h and @s to right-side te contract :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|barnets: so have tto get to 6N|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = relay, 2@c = 4+@c|pg||
nt|barnets: by n|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay|pg||
nt|kit: 6NT from North is still okay, but that may not be so easy to work out.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@h = 4@s, 5+@c|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@s = relay, 3@c = 4-2-2-5 eactly|pg||
nt|kit: somehow South's distributional info isn't what North needs here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3@d = strong relay, shows definite slam interest|pg||
nt|barnets: if north can find out that south has an ace and 2 kings he should be able to work it out|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: yes, but can he find that out?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3NT = 4+ controls|pg||
nt|barnets: thats last chance gone|pg||
nt|kit: uhoh -- now NT is wrongsided as well|pg||
nt|phil: but he passed as dealer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs specific location of controls|pg||
nt|barnets: unlucky system|pg||
nt|kit: And with the distributional info about the South hand, Rodwell figures to find the diamond lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|phil: Rob, are there any relay breaks that could have cut to the chase on a specific suit? |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: even when there are my observation is relayers don't use them|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s shows a Club honour (A or K), a @s honour, A or K and denies anything in @h (spiral scan)|pg||
nt|barnets: north probably realised when south responded hearts about the leaad problem|pg||
nt|kit: I think this type of relay structure tends to work better on more balanced hands|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps he should have ensured he bid no trumps first|pg||
nt|rhelle: I agree that on this hand switching @h and @s doesn't work well. Some you win, some you lose|pg||
nt|phil: in many strong systems, opener has the option to relay, or just make a value call like 2@h or 3@h which initiates natural bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: instead of a 100 percent slam we have a 50 percent one|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: alos, I am not 100% sure of the 3NT response - in the original system South should bid 4@d to show 5 controls|pg||
nt|barnets: of course west still has to find lead|pg||
nt|phil: so Rob, what exactly does Rodwell know at this point? |pg||
nt|kit: knowing South's shape, diamond seems pretty indicated as simply safest lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: skipping 4@c as that shows a 7411 distribution|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|phil: 2@h supposedly a normal weak 2|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a very effective lead, and possibly necessary to defeat the contract -- not sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only 8 tricks, will need to force help|pg||
nt|kit: But maybe he can still make -- if South shifts to diamond honor, declarer can power 3 hearts, 2 spades, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, so doesn't need to give up a spade trick|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like n/s have 2 clubs and 2 diamonds need a fifth trick|pg||
nt|phil: thats what I count|pg||
nt|kit: But if South passively returns a heart, what should declarer do?  Probably has to go after diamonds.|pg||
nt|phil: and there are sufficient entries to do whats needed|pg||
nt|kit: South may be considering putting in 7 of clubs here -- but would declarer really play low from dummy without the 8?|pg||
nt|phil: agree - that seems deep|pg||
nt|kit: similarly, if declarer had Kx of clubs, would he have played low?|pg||
nt|barnets: could he have stiff K again|pg||
nt|rhelle: they lead 3/5, so that is unlikely|pg||
nt|phil: Bauke and Meck are really bridge's equivalent in the irrestible force and the unmovable object in their pace of play :)|pg||
nt|barnets: south maybe wondering what he will lead to trick 2 if he wins trick|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: does declarer have to go after clubs now to win the timing race|pg||
nt|kit: no, I think he has to go after diamonds first|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: so the ninth from diamonds, 2 clubs impractical|pg||
nt|phil: he needs both|pg||
nt|phil: or a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: and he will get them|pg||
nt|kit: he can (and will) get 2 club tricks, but later|pg||
nt|kit: If South covers with jack (which looks best I think), then declarer makes his club play|pg||
nt|barnets: if north had a diamond hnour and shifted to spades dec could win and knockout second diamond honour then duck second spade|pg||
nt|barnets: ensuring ninth trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Rodwell called the director|pg||
nt|gosia:  feels better to play low @d and insert 8 in case something good comes up on the right ?|pg||
nt|barnets: if def play a club instead dec gets his ninth trick there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and so he should!!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|kit: probably for time considerations?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: 90 minutes in; 8 boards completed |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: Exactly|pg||
nt|gosia:  looks like 9 now|pg||
nt|kit: South was legitimately concerned that his partner might have stiff 10 -- that's why he played low|pg||
nt|phil: Kit - has there been any serious efforts to curb abuses of slow play? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now almost any line works|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: we can see that covering is better (although hand would still make), but remember -- we can see all the hands -- he can't|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can actually squeeze south with third heart now|pg||
nt|kit: I'm a little surprised Rodwell didn't continue diamonds, although it probably won't matter|pg||
nt|gosia:  clubs now seem better |pg||
nt|phil: he might be concerned Simon ducked the A@d|pg||
nt|kit: and if simon did duck ace of diamonds, isn't that all the more reason to continue the suit?|pg||
nt|gosia:  he knows at least one honor on side from low @c start|pg||
nt|phil: not if he cashes the 3rd heart to effect some squeeze against South - as was suggested :)|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he knows the club position from the big problem South had at trick 1 -- what other holding would South have such a problem with?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: Q107 Kit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gosia:  it seems to me just from the last hour it's difficult to figure out what South is thinking :)|pg||
nt|gosia:  and he's in again :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at some point surely you realize your chasing windmills|pg||
nt|phil: what time did this hand start? |pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: last chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|gosia:  not likeley opened 2 @h with 4 @s|pg||
nt|phil: I am getting some funny comments from viewers in the middle east saying this hand started yesterday - I suppose they are right :)|pg||
nt|barnets: far east sstarted tomorrow|pg||
nt|gosia:  and Nadal won a set in that time :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Automatic Message : If you are stil at Board 25 - Please check your connection -|pg||
nt|barnets: the longer west thinks is he more likely to get it right?|pg||

nt|bobdrijver: any trick might force you to play @S K and duck one to south|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lc: I like his line of play.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: though he made up quite nicely for this|pg||
nt|lc: Too much danger of tap out if cashed @DAK early.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lc: 3@S -- worth it.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: you give away an easy defense after taking AK of @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lc: A pushy game, but I suspect most N-S bid this -- on same auction in "Std."|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: would be crazy if @H K is onside, but than would you go down with that... tricky board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Lots of handling, but with @H3-3 it has a chance.|pg||
nt|lc: What about trump leads?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Larry, wlould you bid game not vul on Hamman's cards?|pg||
nt|lc: Yes.|pg||
nt|lc: If I played them like Bob does :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lc: Mind you, this is not a very good game.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol|pg||
nt|lc: So, dec has 8 top tricks with @H split. Need 2 ruffs to get to 10.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: needs trumps and @H to break?|pg||
nt|lc: At the least, it would seem.|pg||
nt|lc: One thing people don't realize, though.  When facing aggressive opps, when they pass throughout, things more often to break nicely.|pg||
nt|lc: Opps have a way of getting into auction when they have shape.|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, how to play 4@S?|pg||
nt|lc: You are off 3 top tricks (2@D, 1@C) -- so no quick worries.|pg||
nt|warrens:  can he make it if West goes up with the club Ace?|pg||
nt|lc: Real problem is how to score 2 ruffs .|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lc: I'd think that a trump lead would have beaten it since def could get in 3 rounds -- no way to get 2 ruffs then.|pg||
nt|lc: Now, not clear if he can manage to get two ruffs -- we'll see.|pg||
nt|lc: You'd think a trump shift likely.|pg||
nt|lc: But, dec seems to have the entries to ruff 2 @D in his hand (North).|pg||
nt|lc: Let's say @S switch.  Win @SK.  Play a @D.  Win next @S in dummy, ruff @D low.|pg||
nt|lc: Over to the @H and ruff a @D high.   |pg||
nt|lc: But, that might mean a @H ruff for def |pg||
nt|lc: in the process.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: with trumps lead you also still make as long as the majors break by just playing a club?|pg||
nt|lc: So, maybe have to cut communications first with @C play.|pg||
nt|lc: but then they can play 3 trumps.|pg||
nt|lc: tricky.|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 2 trumps|pg||
nt|lc: Let's see, Bob -- trump lead at T1 then a @C play?|pg||
nt|lc: maybe?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: indeed|pg||
nt|lc: Win trump lead at T1 and play @C.  Win @S return in dummy -- |pg||
nt|lc: yes, I think it can always make on any lead.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: though needs trumps and hearts to behave very nice|pg||
nt|lc: Now, it will be easy, it seems.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobdrijver: y|pg||
nt|lc: On  24, Rodwell did indeed open 1NT with the 4=1=4=4 hand (shhh -- don't tell anyone).  Led to 2@H in 5-1 fit, -50.|pg||
nt|lc: Sorry to keep mentioning the local duplicate, but you do get in trouble there if you open 1NT with a singleton.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: is preempting allowed?|pg||

nt|lc: You'd think.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lots of strange things (bridgewise) outlaws in ACBL land|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: If he crossed in @S, he was risking defender throwiing last @H on last @D ruff.|pg||
nt|lc: We still allow preempting in America, yes.|pg||
nt|lc: But not many conventions.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lc: Actually, I am in favor of that for the low-level games. |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Multi is seriously frowned upon|pg||

nt|rhelle: 2NT shows a splinter raise|pg||
nt|gosia:  there must be some alerts in this auction ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C presumably asks where|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: On a trump lead, I'm not so sure he can handle it|pg||
nt|barnets: yes trump def best|pg||
nt|kit: Now the entry situation is easier -- win heart in dummy and play club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense still has time for trumps|pg||
nt|kit: oh no -- I think he needed to keep that queen of hearts entry for the 2 club ruffs and then to get back to draw trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: that looks wrong winning in hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: so it looks like he is going after diamond ruffs instead -- Well, I guess that will barely work|pg||

nt|barnets: kind of a reverse dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it needs a heart split too, but of course we can see that is on|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: I'm still surprised no trump lead -- East is 4-3-3-3 so trumps won't help him much, and there is a known singleton in the dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

nt|bobdrijver: bid|pg||
nt|tarekr:  She was such a sweet heart!|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: usually 10+ with 4+ @D (or 12+ balanced)|pg||
nt|lc: So, presumably, WEst can pass now.|pg||
nt|lc: Usually, on these hands you are content to push opps to 3.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lc: No reason for West to assume his side has a game .|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lc: I would have passed and peacefully taken a likely 100 or 200.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Now, you are getting your side to likely 4@D -- a "LAW violation."|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|buffytvs: I was about to say they'll probbaly hold you responsible for this|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 3@S is an "emergency" bid, a bid that does not show anything but use to not exclude 3NT|pg||
nt|lc: What I mean is that, if you can make 4@D, you were almsot surely going +100 against 3@H. So why bother?|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose 5@D is not a terrible contract after the overcall.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lc: Looks as if Hamman X of 4@C shows @C length (otherwise, how could he X). So declarer should start @D right way, I think.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: Won't play South for short @C and short @D.|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
