nt|dburn: and this is dangerous also|pg||
mb|3C|nt|caitlin: It has been suggested on board 2 that a splinter of 4D might have helped get to slam|pg||
nt|dburn: at least it was, but West decided not to stand her ground|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: had she done so, 2NT would very probably have made|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that would be a reasonable treatment since over 4D there is not room to cuebid both of the off-suits below the game level|pg||

mb|2H|nt|tarekr:  well done espana|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Deas has a nightmare hand.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly, but that would mean you can bid slam when S has heart ace but not when she has C ace (lacking heart ace). in those asymmetrical situations, many partnerships think it ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: makes more sense for the one remaining non-game call to mean "slam-friendly hand"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tarekr:  Maria Carmen Babot and Maria Panadero|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this S hand is an opening 1H bid for amny of us|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: I must say I prefer a 1@h bid especially nv.  Vul perhaps 2@h as you need a beefier hand for that bid.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: the 1D opener has pushed EW to a game they would not have bid, abnd tells them how to make it when it would normally fail|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect lynn will win & lead a D to the ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, why?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont want to hold up because if you win, then when next in N may cash H king playing you for AJ doubleton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she might lead spade ace and spade ten instead|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if you duck the heart you have no chance of 3 heart tricks, but if you win it you have a chance for 3|pg||
nt|kareno: And as for system - if my system calls for an opening bid of 1@d then I bid it - have you noticed how well Meckwell do with their paper-thin opening bids?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Marshall|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||

nt|tarekr:  I am staying out of this debate! LOL|pg||
nt|kareno: Irrespective of opening bid or not the hand would be bid to game e/w.  And south might lead diamonds.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure of that|pg||

nt|caitlin: ok:)|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't drink even virtual ones.  Have to be a bottle of water for me.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i want odds, since i agree they probably wont get there. but many tables at this level would at least come close|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi aussi|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|an|takeout|nt|tarekr:  The wear and tear is showing the spanish pairs at both tables. Lynn and Beth are battlefield hardened to handle the grueling pace very easily.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|caitlin: now is this still taken by North as a reverse?|pg||
nt|caitlin: should be|pg||
nt|caitlin: at this level for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: threshold a bit lower, but lots of playing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|caitlin: S unsure whether they in forcing auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|caitlin: or why jump to 5?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see how S could possibly be uncertain about forcing nature of auction. she has reversed and pd has bid 4th suit which is actually a cuebid|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|caitlin: surely Qx must be working|pg||
nt|kareno: It is a positionally poor card given that east showed spades for takeout.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tarekr:  that is the key. Exactly Ellen|pg||
nt|tarekr:  P bid 5@c without knowing about these 2 cards|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: I think N has a great passed hand in light of the bidding by S. inclined to think that N recognized that too, but that S shut her out with a very ill-judged 5C call|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
nt|tarekr:  By now I think they have to believe their P not their Opp|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree Tarek|pg||

pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont agree about "positionally poor, because S went out of her way to bid spades. could easily have AJ, but even if as bad as ATxx--which is unlikely--the queen in dummy will mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only one spade need be ruffed (assuming E hgas expected KJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think that if S had made a more pudent and cooperative bid, N would have made another forward move|pg||
nt|caitlin: and 3N by S in open room same type of bid IMHO|pg||
nt|tarekr:  cristian! was 2@c explained? 3 suit TO or 2?|pg||
nt|tarekr:  2@c by East|pg||
nt|caitlin: could have bid 2S over 1S to hear more from pd in open|pg||
nt|kareno: It was Alerted as takeout|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2 suiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: 2 suiter|pg||
nt|caitlin: I suspect it is weaker than actual X|pg||
nt|tarekr:  thx.|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Most likely Ellen|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told usually longer diamonds.  2@h would show longer spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: I treat both, by the way, as natural :)|pg||
nt|tarekr:  Makes good sense.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: yes i just looked at the auction in the OR where S leapt to 3N on a different sequence. in fact that 3N may have been at least as ill-judged, because--unlike here--S had no ...|pg||
