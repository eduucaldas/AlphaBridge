mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S|an|h raise, short spades or something else|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still w kill the possebility to find the slam. Open normal and test might better|pg||
mb|2N|nt|janm: 2@s some kind of heart raise - probably balanced with 4 trumps and likely not an invitation?|pg||

nt|janm: See if they can find the slam - 1@d- then 1@s by either S or W, after which it's hard to predict how the auction will go.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they need a direcor to confirm the count as 14?|pg||

nt|janm: I think they need a director to figure out what card is wrong|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|janm: 5@h 2 keycards without the Q, so W knows they're off 2 and also probably can guess that 5@s is better than 5@h, with his good spades, but has the problem of whether 5@s is natural|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: what is he doing? isn't he missing 2 keycards?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will the end be 10 or 11 tricks? The way to handle the @H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he did not interpret 4@D as a fit for hearts|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is also about how to handle the clubs...mortons fork|pg||
