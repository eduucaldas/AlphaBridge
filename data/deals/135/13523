nt|chick: EW sold out cheaply, can make 140, so they need to set this|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hi Bob, good for S:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzgp: Hard not to go overboard for EW here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Bas.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I guess this is one of the situations where partnership agreement on two-suited overcalls are really important, especially their strength|pg||

nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 now|pg||
nt|chick: already a good score for NS, even -1 ok|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: they just drew the wrong pards,  e and n should be pards, and S and W  (for the suits they have) |pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: this will be a challenge,  not sure I can see 9 tricks  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can find 8   |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2-suits overcalls are recommended for all the time - if you aren't strong enough, opps will play knowing your shape exactly |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but this W hand is bold|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: an easy 2@S to begin the set for EW|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: or maybe only 7 given depending upon what defense does |pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: Me neither, and I couldn't get an explanation because I'm too far from the table :(|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer will probably go for the @c's, hoping for AJ or AQ doubleton with S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without trump lead, this contract can hardly be made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: well 4@S appears to be natural, but i would never dream of offering that bad a suit twice |pg||
pc|dT|pc|c5|pc|dK|pg||

nt|sybarra: mini weak 2  |pg||
nt|yuval10: EW's style is very aggressive, and we had some good examples of it the first 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: I cannot agree Yuval, I play the same weak 2's :) Only problem is I don't have the play to back it up :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to Alywn Jihe from China :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Bas, are they using screens?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, they are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: with a pass hand, i would like to bid 2H|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1@H? interesting choice|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play BlueClub?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I'm not sure, but I doubt it|pg||
nt|iceblue: seems canape style|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may play in a quiet 2 @H's |pg||
nt|wstuart: probably so|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: look at it this way  "only 50's" |pg||
nt|wstuart: very unappetizing for either hand to come in with marginal values on a no fit auctino.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not sure where they would play anyway (n/s) |pg||
nt|wstuart: agreed|pg||
nt|wstuart: One of the hardest things to convince some players of is that it is OK to defend if neither partner has a clear bid.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iceblue: must be, i bet|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: same final contract as if W had bid 1nt over 1@c|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wstuart: "Pass"  it's the green card in the bidding box.  Try it, you might like it...  lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defense has its own pleasures|pg||
nt|sybarra: and at this vulnerability,  you bid likely to be X'd|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, especially at this vul.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|iceblue: else, its hard to understand 1@S PASS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, there cc says Canape openings|pg||
nt|wstuart: But fundamentally, it's a matter of trick taking.  Do you want try and take 6 tricks on defense or 9 tricks on offense?  If no one has  a clear bid, I usually go for teh 6 tricks.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  bidding needs explanation, but final contract is OK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: EW play a pretty complicated system over 1NT openings, but I'm not sure how it exactly works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the main point - it works!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it is time for a book (in English as well) explaining modern dutch bidding the BD way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has a lot of job to do|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, but when you can perhaps write 90 or 120 in the "plus" side , it hurts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceblue: and thats why E passed 1@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: no problem as long as he plays diamonds before a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  uhu|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: in fact a trump return by parchtman was best|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|wstuart: Due to the friendly @S position decl will make 8 or 9 tricks, depending on how well he solves his @D problem.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it can cost a trick from his point of view|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yeah, @HT is a critical card for that play to work|pg||

nt|sybarra: how did we do that? |pg||
nt|wstuart: didn't he make 2?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a possible 6@d on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry yes|pg||
nt|wstuart: np|pg||
nt|wstuart: made me look bad, just as I said he was going to make 8 to claim -2  ;)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: 4@h and a minor suit?|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not play A@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the operator has a sense of humor?|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for you too np:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|nt|yuval10: 2@h suppose to be good raise with 8+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E asking for minor |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now it¬¥s easy to find @cQ in 6@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many @s's now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s I think:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Just because I'm paranoid it doesn't mean that they are not all out to get me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: You have no idea.... *grin*|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  this hope this is a @H raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wstuart: Yes, solid theory to play the 3NT bid as art on this auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but Bob the movie still reads -2, please correct|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||
nt|chick: I don't think E has enough controls to carry on to 6, but N might push him to it with 5@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: who's thinking now, i wonder|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably East|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and we can find that with our cuebids - no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator will get it fixed |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  one more example of BD system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: This could be regular Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: And Drijver figuring out how high he should bid|pg||
nt|wstuart: Tough decision for west there|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yuval10: 4@d will go down 1, the defence isn't suppose to be any difficult|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....that was fleeting |pg||

nt|iceblue: whats the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 15-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure it is that tough with 5 hts |pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: good analysis!|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to Frank Budai from Down Under :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: They are (presumably) in a force; he has a stiff @S which argues for passing, but a min hand, which argues for DBL.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Ahum, there you go|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: and 3s singleton|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S after 2@S shows INV with 5cards+ @S, not promise @Hs|pg||
nt|yuval10: after the bidding i guess it won't be too hard to find the Q@c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: ok now for -2 maybe |pg||
nt|yuval10: probably|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all part of a method developed in sweden called scanian|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|mcphee: this will depend on the @D guess which I expect E to make correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Maybe 3@D instead of X by N would've been more descriptive?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like dble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with N hand, @s lead looks better|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: more ways to win|pg||
nt|imp_jan: prefer dbl indeed, south cld have wests spades and pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: True enough|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wstuart: With 5 trumps and Jxx in @S, east diagnoses, based on the 4@S bid,  that his partner's DBL is about a bad hand, not a doubleton @S and decides to bid on.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: looks makeable from this seat, but in practise i doubt will suceed|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like -1 from here |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  this time, declarer's work is even harder|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wstuart: yup|pg||
nt|wstuart: I gues they would have beat 4@S 1 or 2 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there was no chance for 5@H on any lead|pg||

nt|frankaus: nows the volcano dust in poland? planes flying?|pg||

nt|yuval10: i don't think he'll sell out so quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H maybe then  to keep it going |pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 6 @D with the right guesses |pg||
nt|yuval10: the 2 pairs from Israel in this tournement will both represent Israel in the upcomming European championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|sybarra: would 3 @D be forcing  I am not sure of their system |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 5-4 with such reverse - is OK|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iceblue: 2@D shows 4+cards @S|pg||
nt|frankaus: ah drury i'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: along with a 3rd pair, Ilan and Ofir Herbst|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok quanti,  (I should stick with first thought) |pg||
nt|yuval10: W has a minimum, i'm not sure he'd like his KJ doubleton @h either, and his 5 cards suit isn't too good either|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to the studio Andy :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  moreover, several pairs (playing non-forcing stayman) have agreement that 1NT opening promises at least 3-2 in majors|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S=light opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, the 5th @H made him wonder.  Had @H been 3-0 4@S was making.  5H was not such a bad decision, though it is likely to cost them at least 5 IMPs./|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@S is a trap, as really there is no sound game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, I've got the cc here now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yuval10: pass is very reasonable , unlucky that it all breaks so well|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt is logical place to play |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days (many for me) it doesnt break this well |pg||
nt|sybarra: the minor suit breaks make this hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  gm everyone|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3-0 @H will happen 22% of the time, a priori, perhaps more when you consider that they freely chose to bid 4@S.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: I think E has to play low on @s9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|imp_jan: hi andy|pg||
nt|sybarra: goodbye ht |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: and now a difficult discard for W|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcphee: hmmmm|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jan, Bob, Bas, Roland and all specs:)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: South knows that north lacks a club control..|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be 6 card key card|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|imp_jan: but what can he do, he is not the captain of the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  asking for 2nd rd control?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @C2 for a @D return, I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or at least showing @D values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W has to be brave enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  underlead his @d ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @DA-@Dx works as well, no?|pg||
nt|chick: even if low is correct, there are two entries to dummy, so cannot stop him using the spades|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C is likely to be 2 way checkback here; it forces 2@D which can either be passed, as on this hand, or another bid can be made which is natural and invitational.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my my|pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hm|pg||
nt|mcphee: somehtng terrible took place here|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the best slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to play for the revoke now|pg||
nt|mcphee: S has misunderstood 6@C|pg||
nt|mcphee: either that or a caddy is sitting in for this hand:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 5N may have been pick a slam from S's perspective|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is beginning to seem that S did not thing 4N was rkc|pg||
nt|mcphee: think|pg||
nt|imp_jan: thought it was a race between hearts and spades, but clubs it was |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|mc|10|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|daman: ruff with the !K and play a @H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think defence can always beat it too much work to sdo with those thin trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are 4 losers to dispose of  the spade and 3@d hard to do without promoting an extra trump for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well specs seem to think he will make it|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: this hand could be interesting|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  6 more chances to go )))|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  all games for EW seemed doomed|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 4@s has the best shot|pg||
nt|mcphee: when S does not win the K@D in the eventual 3N west is going to have to guess well|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am assuming N will not discover the killing A@C lead to 3N:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: hehe|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S looks to be the spot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this only goes to prove bridge events should not be scheduled in morning hours|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Haha, good thinking Martin|pg||
nt|iceblue: DO NS play polish club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, they do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But the duck in @s forced S to use an entry to the table and there was no endplay but a guess|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: where do we want to play now? |pg||
nt|andyv:  W does have a hand... may not be expecting that light of hand from E|pg||
nt|frankaus: is the pope catholic :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Kalita shaking his head as he passed :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: must be, S would dble if play STR 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: that is true, but I think this must be 3N not 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Jansma: "If this goes down I'll buy you a drink" to Paulissen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: likely @S lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: remember brd 2, where @CQ shld have ducked by decl?|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead certainly doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it will all come down to the @D suit in any case|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the other match barel ducked indeed!|pg||
nt|mcphee: looking like 2-4 leads for the Poles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Only vs NT, vs suit they lead odd|pg||
nt|imp_jan: though in the middle of the game, decl got a spade lead, and eventually made 4@H dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or so it seems from previous boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: is this really 4N Bas?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: lol yes|pg||

nt|sybarra: apparently |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: these are challenging hands!!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like "doping", no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I'm thinking 1@D Walsh, 1@H unbalanced and 1@S fsf is too easy an explanation, haha|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think we are seeing a lot of switched rebids much like Meckwell use|pg||
nt|frankaus: this willl not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: although 1 or 2 hts might play better |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for fix |pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry it took so long ; )|pg||
nt|wstuart: This reminds me of the old description of an early IBM operating system, VM:  " It may be slow, but at least it's hard to use."  Here their bidding makes me think, "I may not have ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: a good hand, but at least you don't know what my distribution is."|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes possible for players playing natural, 1@C-1@H-1@S-2@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: i am sure he will not take K@D|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: probably 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: For those of you who wonder what N/S are thinking about; we're playing with screens, so I'm only entering a bid as the tray passes through the screen to avoid giving information to ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: the players when the other side bid|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|mcphee: oh , well that ends our discussion of not winning the K:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is seriously artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: So what's the best contract here, 6@H?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I hate it when the bids don't register :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
nt|sybarra: been there done that |pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: you can either go for the @c's here or play for the @d's, both works out it seem|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|mcphee: and I thot this hand was all about the @D:)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: is it obvious to play clubs before trumps, not clear to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: W's @HK shouldn't be in E, because S could've given N a @C ruff if it was|pg||
nt|frankaus: trying for short @C K|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  if clubs are 2-2 - doesn't matter (if 4-0 - too)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, you can influence situation with 3-1 clubs only|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  and acceptable trump break is necessary as well - 3-2. declarer can allow 1 round of trumps|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  partner accepted @c (passing), so E can try|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how many bids do you make with a real opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I would bid 1@D, p might have 2@C and 5@D, showing distribution in competition is important imho|pg||
nt|sybarra: now could support @D's with the rebid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Can't with a source of losers (not winners) against a hand which is not known to be balanced|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzgp: Not many people do it, but some open 19 BAL with 2NT systematically, which would probably lead to a 4@S contract in S|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: near record numbret of bids below 3nt, especiall since this is not a pure relayauction|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: is "lucky"  but well bid by them |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forced 2@D then 2NT shows some big hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: For the record, OR went down the same way on the first three boards but on the fourth they made 2@S+3 where N went -2 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: *-2 in 4@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  without @c ruff, in the  4 declarer takes 5 spades, 4 clubs and ace-king @h|pg||

nt|Gerben42: only need to ruff one @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it needs careful play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: drijver probably knows brink shape but he needs to  know location of honours |pg||
nt|Gerben42: ruff the @C lead and play @H7?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  as an option, yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: seems rather safe requires @H not 6-1 and you can check which way @D are 4-0|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzgp: Looks like Brink was master after all|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well done in probably the longest Dutch auction in history by a pair not playing Tarzan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  modern agressive bidding makes W open 1@c, but thereafter E has to put on system or imagination to believe in that partner's @c |pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|sybarra: probably a cheerful quiet pass from W |pg||
nt|sybarra: or does S bid again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 5@C in S would probably be made, 5@C in N would probably go down, funny things, leads.|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to pass when your P free-bided with 4@h and you have 20 points. S is also considering the fact his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a lot to think about |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I agree|pg||
nt|yuval10: his @h suit consist of only 3 cards and has nothing in it, so a lot to consider|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: Night Martin, thanks :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  have a nice dream Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 5@C a control bid, just how N didnt mean RKC|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hope|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: If 2@C is either weak @D or strong, 3@D is probably barrage, right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S an interesting call |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what it is   really |pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-bidding as compared with OR meaningful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: very good decision by S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, W has to invite|pg||
nt|mcphee: only see 8|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@H is the best?|pg||
nt|fann4: A light overcall by E, vul too, but the 5431 shape and @DK make it better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: I think the fact that Pachtman had already passed was important in Ginossar's decision to pass 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: W also did very well here to bid only 3@s, knowing that he has a very good def. against 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C can be weak from Pachtman? the auction suggests otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: BD being shown 'nother way to slam :)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|fann4: N wants to do something, with 10pts, but what?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Bas is back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Hey all :)|pg||
nt|fann4: N should have 5@D for this action, so 3@D safer than 2NT now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|mcphee: E being minimum will give up|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: better than @S anyway|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: just unsure how Pachtman knows Ginossar didnt have a singleton @C|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|fann4: So N rescues himself to 3@D - he could be facing a doubleton opposite.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|fann4: The bottom line here is that EW's bidding - the light overcall and the raise on a doubleton honour - have done their work and pushed NS too far.|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|andyv:  not much to do:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: not happening Andy:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: N is thinking...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcphee: even had N split his trumps it was going down|pg||
