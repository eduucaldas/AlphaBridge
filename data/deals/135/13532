mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Oddur's approach was odd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2!@s 2@h  dim and club to lose with this horrible duplication|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already showed a sound heart raise, and then he bid game laterr after partner showed nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i was thinking of making the same pun but i thought ikt too corny|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But not a word about Eyjafjallajökull, Ben|pg||

nt|mr murray: 8 loser hand.  expects a lot from partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west yhas a balanced hand with a few high cards no hope for game but defensive chances|pg||

pc|c2|nt|chick: so a X'd hand to start us off, maybe will be an exciting set of hands :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Turned a minus into a plus.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction is a bit confusing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They could bring some excitement but the first 2 places are not changeing, there is a possibility that 3rd and 4th could change places|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was the right value bid, how can N double?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Apparently W always intended to bid 4@H, but wanted to show it was on power, not shape.  Meanwhile N looks to have plenty of tricks to double opposite a partner worth a free call.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: when N bid 3S he said: "i am worth an invite in spades", the rest is up to you. W bid strongly and EW are not vul, so they dont rate to go down more than one. S was not vul either ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so with spades might have taken some liberties. if N thought his hand was this good, maybe he should have double 2S|pg||

mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm|pg||

mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|benjent: Best line, Jon?|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult, perhaps three hearts to see if that suit breaks, then a club and the dia finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The line in 7@S after @CA lead must be to cash @SA and play another. When spades are 4-1, you need 7 heart tricks and you will get them|pg||
nt|mr murray: this auction gets them nowhere|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|benjent: Yes, you really want to play a @c up, then cash @h's, then fall back on @d's, but entries don't permit|pg||

nt|benjent: then play a @c up|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Me too, but as we see it doesn't matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: when hearts come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if it gets tyhem to 6@h which it has it will earn a bushell load of imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 14|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: if you get a club lead in 7 spades    right to cash ace and king of hearts   and with the good news will make|pg||
nt|mr murray: they went down in 7 spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumn led to winning 14 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: stumbled into it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how declarer went down, David|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well have punted it for all the info they exchanges|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that dummy was already down to three trumps after the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't enjoy the heart suit if you play it the way you suggest|pg||
nt|lestergold: was natural to play for 3/2 spade break and esnure hearts ame in very unlucky|pg||
nt|mr murray: with heart queen dbltn  7 spades must make|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubole dummy yes but single dummy declarer must weight odds of bad trump break against odds of heart q dropping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once you cash @HA you are down|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||

nt|ady: this is last hand       thx all   enjoyable|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|friggi: so what partscore are we missing here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Intermediate jump overcall, not such a bad idea, especially opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|1N|nt|benjent: 4@h is cold for NS. EW have some potential with their sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: I am not in love with 5@C I must say|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That hand is too flat, and at love all ...     I would not|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: "@C checkback?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|friggi: think so|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: 4@h makes on the spade guess - not a sure thing|pg||
pc|c8|nt|benjent: We saw a gutsy (ie looked wrong) 5@h sac from Ragnar on 2 ... Aron just returning the favour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And when partner has shown intermediate strength there is some hope that we will defeat 4@S with the cards East has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He knows that 5@C can't make|pg||
nt|benjent: @d, @d ruff wasn't actually NS's best defence, although it locks up 1 off. |pg||

nt|benjent: sry - let me clarify re "locks up 1 off" - I mean that South can be very sure he's beating 5@c (at least 1) when he returns a @d|pg||
nt|benjent: Now a low @s, and North has to fly K|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like 8 black suit tricks|pg||
nt|ady: made an overtrick  |pg||
nt|friggi: yes, strange return - no fight|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: thjik Jon unblocked the clubs and tried a diamond  and that can lead to the overtrick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: E-W are world champions from 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The only nation with a 100% record: ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: qualified once and won it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: World Champions in 1991 were: Guðmundur Páll Arnarson, Örn Arnþórsson, Jón Baldursson, Guðlaugur Jóhannsson, Þorlákur Jónsson and Aðalsteinn Jörgensen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So we have two of them at this table, and one in the other room|pg||
