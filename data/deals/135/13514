nt|andyv:  battle of the minors|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|woozle: EW can go two down in 4H, or NS can make 4 of either minor (or maybe a weird 4S)|pg||
nt|andyv:  big @h fit for EW doesn't produce a whole lot of tricks|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Walsh isn't popular in Oz I guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid:  no, it isn't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North Americans would respond 1@S |pg||
nt|woozle: Walsh is fairly popular in Oz, but Burke is of rubber bridge extraction|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this can go down 2|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he probably decided he'd rather play in 2d than 2s even with a spade fit esp since he would raise with 3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  hard to believe a 10 card fit missing just the Ace and two outside Aces can only produce 7 tricks|pg||
nt|woozle: Very tough to get this down two...North can be endplayed in most versions of events|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  down one should be easy though|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: douglas likes to almost play a card, hold it there for 5 seconds, then change his mind. makes vugraphing a little difficult!|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid:  I actually reserve 2@H here for this jand & X fo 3 suited T/O|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Stuart starts by showing his diamonds, which looks like an unlikely way to score 620 in 4S|pg||
nt|woozle: Either 2S or 2H (if it's Michaels) look like better choices to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 2@s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he's going to pass 2@h, E probably should have bid 2@h the first time as a two suited take out|pg||
