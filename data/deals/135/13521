nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Kevin and Chris|pg||
mb|d|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||

nt|cicus: unfortunately, the tournament site is in Estonian|pg||
nt|haans: riinu have you anything to tell about system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos10.htm here are the systems :)|pg||
nt|haans: i do not Aces and KINGs only|pg||
nt|chick: do, but I would downgrade for 2 reasons ... 1. 4333  and  2. very poor texture/intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: saw a fantastic segment before this-what hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: Team on E-W Levi are 1st at the moment on group B, while N-S Sapounakis are 2nd in group B|pg||

nt|petrosa: 3NT in the open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Yuval :)  welcome back |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe he was planning to find a 4-3 @s fit|pg||
nt|cicus: X is penalties for me, they may have different agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning Liz|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last time I logged in someone was going for 1700, which turned out to be 800. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks like a similarly dramatic entrance|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is a tight double and requires the club lead to beat it (to get the ruff). South may have meant the double as bid a major.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard to imagine he meant it as penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I see 2 diamonds, a club and a ruff. And the setting trick?|pg||
nt|olson: looks like  470|pg||
nt|loganrun: Sorry - I was looking at a 4 level contract - expecting a 3S bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Paulissen probably contemplating a 4-0 break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Paulissen asked what @c2 meant, explained as even|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And Zack contemplating -470|pg||
nt|olson: if  trumps  4/0  you lose  3d  and a club  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - I was just trying to understand the long pause :)|pg||
nt|olson: always best  to think in doubled  partials  or any other hand :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: If North has the King of hearts and trumps 4-0 appears to be the only concern|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that will help a lot|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Shirley and Ed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|zoh:  5@c gia na bgoyn prepei na paixei to K@c apo to mort|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a 2@s response, 4@s would probably a better final spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not allow the @H bid to deter me from leading my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Panagaki-Virvidakis. They both were 4th and 5th in their groups|pg||
nt|eleni: Nick Tagaras and Theodore Triantafyllidis are from Thessaloniki, Greek Macedonia, while the young gentlemen , Manolis Protonotarios and Philippe Karamanlis, from Athens|pg||

pc|dT|nt|bmkl: favorable spade layout will make iit easy|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|cicus: I am surprised at seeing no 3@C preempt from west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|MolvaM: I would prefer a 1NT overcall from north here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: making but difficult to bid KQ@C off side would not be worth it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like a natural 2NT - an almost extinct bid in a competitive auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: The Ladies Mrs.Panagaki and Mrs.Syrakopoulou may lose their @h fit:(|pg||
nt|spyrosm: 5@D= but Fillpos have everything need to balance|pg||
nt|bmkl: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: against Lucas Zotos and Aris Sapounakis (asapou)|pg||
nt|haans: prempt in 3rd u mean?|pg||
nt|cicus: N would have been in an awkward situation|pg||
nt|othered1: Anayone know what system EW plays?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on style (how weak a suit may be to open), it's possible that @S are best spot for NS,  s ingle dummy.  But that's quite a decision for north whose partner did see the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: vul before bidding 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At 3 maybe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: now will play 3@C|pg||
nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
nt|othered1: Many play rescue redouble focuses on opener's suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow a XX |pg||
nt|sybarra: that comment would be made in jest  since they know how "lucky" it was  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wise pass - partner has shown club values and no enthusiasm for the majors|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||

nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
nt|othered1: note that south picked his better red suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's 1NT actually helped EW to get to a better contract|pg||
nt|loganrun: Jansma debating about doubling and does so|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a hand I would say "do not try this at home"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: these are seasoned partnerships  |pg||
nt|othered1: south has a decision here?  I'd love to have this hand when partner bids @S into the opening bidder.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|yuval10: very dangerous to make a balancing when you don't have the other major|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East will be overjoyed - 'You are on our own'|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H may have been 4 @H|pg||
nt|haans: 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: This should do much better than 3@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 730 better with that lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure a I lead a @S on that auction |pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer now has timing to drive the @D and pull trumps.|pg||
nt|othered1: not to ignore the trick lost in @S, either.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: nice bid from George Loussis|pg||
nt|zlatan: accident...|pg||
nt|eleni: still 5@s can make|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why east thought south would have relative @S length, requiring that lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zoh:  Tora atoy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now draw some trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: need to get the trumps going quickly if any hope to survive|pg||
nt|chick: be fair, not an easy hand for any system|pg||
nt|haans: easy in natural 1@H p p p|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very tempting to take the heart fnesse now|pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|yuval10: so far West had the majority of the points in each board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cicus: now the task is to apply the brakes in time|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H better game this time|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid hearts, though|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder usually have 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-S hand did not require balancing but they are daring players dont let a chance go.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i tania obrona pikami na NS|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|mcphee: lots of tricks in @S |pg||
nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet he plays against experienced players:) George Roussos and Manos Hatzidakis (mathat on BBO)|pg||
nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hitting the deck on 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
nt|haans: south to have opps honors so no slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better write a book about WJS - this is board 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not mean to be critical or double dummy  but from k10xx,  .......|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, with cards lying right, EW can make about 9 tricks in @S, but no way in safely at these colors.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  see what I know,  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Barel has uncovered 3 keycards - can he now find the third round heart control?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||

nt|ghionis: nikos (a very friendly person) always enjoy the game as he does the same with his life|pg||
nt|eleni: unless if we have a surprise:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|flash: coach Anton Maas usually tries to have the pairs play against different opponents and in different team combinations throughout|pg||
nt|othered1: At m atchpoints, I  might reopen with 2@S on east's hand.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: nowaday's approach is to bid games with thin values when red|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: he has never read at least one bridge book but he is excellant card player (and poker too)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friend placement of cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice lead by N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: friendly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'Must have play - at worst on a finesse'|pg||
nt|olson: after down 1400   he may think he  needs  to make a grand|pg||
nt|loganrun: This bid has a bit of catch up about it|pg||
nt|loganrun: Sorry Jeff - I typed too slowly|pg||
nt|olson: s could laways have the Spade K which would make it cold |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: there is chance to make this|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D was kcb|pg||

nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: and what did 4@D really mean?|pg||
nt|haans: clibs honor + @HK at south can not be a suprise|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is red and imps.....  not as easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: I bet Brink-Drijver would bid 2@s :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: young as they are :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call them "fearless" |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are not 12 you know,  |pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  To please psrtner, South should overtake and plan @D Queen...|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer know no sane player will lead under Q of trump so he tried the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he also unblocked with the T@s , might be segnificent|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
nt|chick: he won't feel bad for too long, there is simply no place for the losing diamond to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: and fairly seasoned |pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: the needed switch but looking a dummy its easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the face of it 2@S and 2@H can't be avoided|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
nt|cicus: at first sight N can be squeezed but he discards after dummy|pg||
nt|chick: unless ....  W leads the @D10 and N covers|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S would've play Q@s and @s then declarer win finesse the @c's and play AK@d and T@d discard @h|pg||
nt|olson: 1440  is never a bad score at imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He wll be happy with dummy - predict a quick claim|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i teraz tylko otworzyæ kara póki kontrolujemy trefle|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
nt|lelos: paizei ton zozi gia K@c kai A@s|pg||
nt|haans: if 3@C did show minimum East had no cards for slam|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not as familiar with the goings on with Polish team, so if anyone has any inside information, by all means, let me know  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: and they consider themselves invulerable instead of non-vulerable sometimes   |pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 3rd @h goes over the 9@d and just made|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think that is not a "thinking play"  .....these guys are thinking all the time |pg||
nt|rnmalik: now we know the play of T@S on trick one-all options open|pg||
pc|dK|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: then you still lose a @H for 11|pg||
nt|eleni: with the 10@d return, he has chances|pg||
nt|lelos: +K@d fusika|pg||
nt|chick: E will have to stop now and try to trump some clubs|pg||
nt|haans: why cover the 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the @D-suit by far too weak|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't say he should, only that it's the only possible hope for W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was just ONLY chance for making the contract|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s why S should overtake and play @D Queen|pg||
nt|chick: when you are outmanned, outgunned, and out of ideas, there is just one remaining hope ..... guile|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: will soon be overruffed|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "invisible" is the next piece of that joke |pg||

pc|s9|nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW are the leading pair in the butler among the Dutch pairs|pg||
nt|yuval10: as you all ( might ) know, this tournement is all about picking up the Dutch team|pg||
nt|yuval10: for both Ostende ( euro. championship ) and the Bermuda Bowl the following year ( NET. are the host, therefor they've secure their place in it )|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Warren Spector |pg||

nt|warrens:  hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: hello Warren :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N/S were Warren's team mates in the spingold |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like declarer has only reasonable line: finesse the club (low to jack to get to dummy) then double finesse the diamonds for a heart discard |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|droopy17: kalo peximo|pg||
nt|eleni: wd John, he created a 3rd entry to his hand!|pg||

nt|warrens:  but it will cost him an extra undertrick ifwrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: Looks like 4 is now available|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: Yes, Hans, very astute and if S had seen that at the table, he would be a hero|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: true, he would have to depend on the @H finesse then|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: only way is a dummy reversal, ruff 3@C and win the @C9 as  12|pg||
nt|haans: 2 clubs + hearts = 3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|eleni: 9@s and let it ride...........|pg||
nt|cicus: this is not a good line anyway, a @D should have dbeen ducked first|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 1 more spade = dummy reversal|pg||
nt|chick: but if he draws trump loses another club instead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||
nt|eleni: he thought too long and played the wrong card:) that's Manolis Protonotarios:) when he plays fast, he is a great player|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzgs: Waiting till Paulissen comes back|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This idea with overtaking is not so stupid - itÂ´s the right defence|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I suppose one could say 'well done' but it doesn't feel right :)|pg||

nt|ghionis: i missguesed:(|pg||
nt|haans: being on BBO may get some pressure on them|pg||

pc|s6|nt|flash: E-W don't seem to have gotten a good grip on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S a nice bid by south, getting things solidly set for slam investigation|pg||
nt|chick: taking S a long time to bid 5@C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: The trouble with the ultra light protection is that partner is marked with a good hand and you will get too high.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|rodal f: 5@D flat by the nice @D layout|pg||

nt|lelos: still 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Group A after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|eleni: Nick thinks and thinks forever:)|pg||
nt|petrosa: firstly nonforcing bid and then slam|pg||
nt|eleni: a sound slam for E-W|pg||
nt|cicus: well if they have a 2-way checkback method (2@C for invites, 2@D for game force)|pg||
nt|cicus: then 3@S shows good spades but not forcing|pg||
nt|haans: i did once find 5@C bid 3@C prempt fooling opps to bid once more then 4@S from me corrected|pg||

nt|petrosa: in the open room they didn;t find the right contract|pg||
nt|petrosa: the first deal was 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: tHE first deal was 3@D|pg||
nt|chick: yes, it's hard to show the solidity of suits like these|pg||
nt|haans: more boring hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is quick summary)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: yes it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can West get to 3@C - perhaps by bidding 3@C?|pg||
nt|olson: yes  if the shortness  is known to be diamonds|pg||
nt|olson: or  if  3c  is pass  or correct  if club shortness|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Traditionally the shortage would be in diamonds - and he does not seem to have enough to hope for game opposite a limited opener|pg||
nt|loganrun: Which seems quite plasible|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cicus: I admit I have no idea what 3@H means|pg||

nt|MolvaM: maybe west should have just bid 5@c and leave them alone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: someone should bid @S or you will not play them|pg||
nt|MolvaM: was 3@d forcing?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so far all the bidding has not excited the S hand|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@dx-1 was the contract in the open roon on board 5|pg||
nt|liarakos: to 2H den itan forcing?|pg||
nt|mcphee: S prrfers to stress @D rather than bid 2@C|pg||

nt|rnmalik: good bid-but S has shown minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: just how many?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me 5@S if not DBL|pg||
nt|yuval10: it all sounds to North like S has a singel @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe bids 5 @H "on the way" |pg||
nt|yuval10: in wonder if pass from south over 5@d showed indeed minimal values|pg||
nt|yuval10: *i|pg||
nt|sybarra: or forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Dimos Dionysopoulos is in a jam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would treat 3@D is highly invitational|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S alerted, might show spades and clubs, if so , now possible W will lead a club against a slam|pg||
nt|olson: probably   takes a spade lead  to beat  5c   depends  who declares|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  konrakt @D preferowany dla NS w teh sesji, czy EW znajdÄ @H, na 2@H, 3@C juz nie idzie ...|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|haans: slam was not easy|pg||
nt|othered1: system didn't allow south to get his @C into the auction, so north is unlikely to find killling lead|pg||
nt|chick: any lead gives a trick, although clubs obviously best|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: room|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is impossible to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|haans: open 1nt pass pass pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a diamond and a switch. |pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|olson: but a trump  is possible to stop  ruffs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not easy for North - perhaps Jansma has evaluated his hand correctly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nikos intended 3@d as forcing I guess?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D wont catch too much in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: many N players would not bid 1@H after opening 1@C, but select 1NT instead|pg||
nt|zoh:  5@d kako score gia zeygi|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Q: what is the point of doubling 5@C when you already raised|pg||
nt|petrosa: where are the diamonds?|pg||
nt|eleni: quite a friendly lead from Fotis:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Fotis should find the 4@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry about the mistake |pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I win this prize  (for what it is worth)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok- a coke:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: North worried about a trump lead as he does not have entries to continue the attack|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping to mae a ruff. More ammunition for my anti-doubleton-lead campaign|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: I know many north players who wouldnt bid anything |pg||
nt|liarakos: hmm|pg||
nt|lelos: something wrong with bidding proly|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is difficult to find 7-2 fit nowdays|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard (South) is trying to hit the deck!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i think the pass was forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: I really like the bid 5 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
nt|loganrun: He needs his partner to have tricks and from his hand a heart looks most promising (as he has spade length) but...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer still needs 7 trump tricks|pg||
nt|olson: still some problems  , cannot pull 3 trumps and  if he does not  N  can ruff the heart trick while he discards  spade|pg||
nt|loganrun: Which adds to the plus of a heart lead - sorry Liz about your campaign|pg||
nt|olson: S needs to avoid  spade K back|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  czy nasi znajdÄ 2@S/3@D czt tez wolÄ broniÄ ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C would have done it :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||
nt|eleni: true, while at the other table Yiangos got a bit chicken|pg||
nt|cicus: E had two chances to bid the suit but failed to find them|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: all moot now, S is signing off in 5|pg||
nt|othered1: will south duck the first @D?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petrosa: so more imps for Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|chick: well, good auction anyway, they found the right spot|pg||
nt|flash: again, many options...   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: including @d7 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has indeed 4th @s and a good spade @s, but XX @d and all other points are garbage|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: cue in clubs then all easy|pg||
nt|haans: not far fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: it's not unprecedented for declarer to get this right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice duck|pg||
nt|chick: wish my BIL students were here, took me about 3 weeks to convince them to duck the first diamond :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right or wrong, he can say that he thought about it.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I like all the bids except 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps that is why N should "respect" 5 @S    |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt N has a good hand, after 3@S by S has 3 losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C drives them to 6 @S   the club bid may be the one you hate?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: 2 leads at the same time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|warrens:  yes, should trust partner to go with an Ace and King or a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: at this level, yes I think so |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, declarer could have afforded to win the first @H, but this is definitely safer|pg||
nt|flash: the alternative would be to play on @Ds; as we can see, that also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: clubs safer after the discard?|pg||
nt|flash: however, the entry situation looks to get quite tangled, if declarer goes after @Ds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petrosa: he didn't describe his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: over 3@H he was probably obliged to bid his stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: Does ace give them an extra  undertrick?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not much to play for here|pg||
nt|othered1: win, @S10 and south has to duck again|pg||
nt|chick: only hope now is to drop the @SQ in 2 tricks, which doesn't happen|pg||
nt|chick: right Ed, that works for an extra spade trick, but not an entry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|chick: although can't argue with success, they *are* in the lead :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: Paulissen: I knew taking wih @cA was no good...|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Team Orange consists of 4 pairs, all of which will be in play every set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|flash: they rotate teammates and opponents|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|flash: this is one of a series of events which coach Anton Maas will use in selecting the 3 pairs to represent the Netherlands in this year's European Championships|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: mb @CA was not taken in less than 1 second but it was Roel catching up played cards:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: nope, it took 1.1 second..|pg||
nt|flash: they're playing at a very special site - 't Onstein - in the Netherlands; we'll have to get one of Roland's clones or someone from the Netherlands to help with the details of the ...|pg||
nt|flash: site|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: not sure: www.onstein.nl  ?|pg||
nt|djneill: one way to play this is to get a @h ruff and hope for a singleton or doubleton @d honor|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

pg||

nt|petrosa: it was another flat board:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: 6@d at the open room|pg||
nt|ghionis: oh only the viewgrafer was:)|pg||
nt|haans: second slam try|pg||
nt|haans: with u (no joke 2)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dumme many tricks N/S here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean, that a declarer playing his sington King - he has NOT 2 or 3 small in the suit. He DREAMS about finding an opponent, who will take the trick|pg||
nt|flash: given the @H lead (and the split of that suit), i'd think that the odds of South having KQx of @Cs are quite slim|pg||
nt|chick: was actually pretty good play by W ... unlucky but he gave himself some chances|pg||
nt|othered1: 16 imps for the 730 on board 2.  EW were doubled making in OR.|pg||
nt|othered1: I really like NS's card so far.|pg||
nt|olson: well , the score is  32/0  so he  is not  complaining|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||
nt|haans: 6 minor|pg||
nt|flash: note that @Ds wouldn't have to be 3-3 for that suit to set up - Hx in either hand would suffice (declarer had all the spots)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Give me that @h suit, and @cKQx and I'd definitely bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 2 was another compression - Israel lost 500 in the other room for 18 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: they will find another slam|pg||
nt|eleni: bad board for E-W if they go up high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S vs 3@H|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4C doubled in the other room on the 1400 here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After the misfit on Board 2, we have the double fit|pg||
nt|loganrun: West thinks he knows what South has|pg||
mb|2D|nt|MolvaM: a very heavy pass from east|pg||
nt|Gerben42: healthy pass :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly sensible to pass E I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yep|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s is a solid contract, losing 1@s+1@h+1@c|pg||
nt|droopy17: ne|pg||
nt|lelos: :)|pg||
nt|lelos: dificult not impossible|pg||
nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||
nt|liarakos: North opened 1@S|pg||
nt|liarakos: it was easier|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d-1 were played in the open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||
nt|haans: not passing tiome South|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an interesting 2-way opening.  I wonder if NS were parpared for it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't deter S from bidding spades though|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a lot of information and might work out what's going on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew,  that was fairly agressive of S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he passes on a hand where I am sure I would bid :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: West going to bid id slowly to try and stop the save|pg||
nt|loganrun: Kibs saying why not show his majors but Jansma is playing a tactical game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 3@h from S perhaps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||
nt|lelos: 2! gazzili|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@c|pg||
nt|chick: so does West :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know the range for east's opening?|pg||
nt|yuval10: or just 4@s|pg||
nt|val44: 1nt = 18-20 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 2@D some trick bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess 2@C shows a fit|pg||
nt|lelos: dionusopoulos is well trained :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW have 3@S= or +1 and 4@C=|pg||
nt|flash: :)   |pg||
nt|flash: most pairs will have a check-back sequence available here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now North presumably knows partner has minors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should give them a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: to overtrick NS at or 1 down is good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||
nt|petrosa: 8+|pg||
nt|haans: and they have @DA and not @CA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: where will this end?|pg||
nt|othered1: Still no certainty from west's perspective that east doesn't have the long @C hand.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lelos: gia pekse|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK Tasos:))|pg||
nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|jcone: makes without a hearts lead   K  will find it though|pg||
nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||
nt|cicus: for what reason?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry, can't tell|pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find for 2@H is that 1@H had been relay|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petrosa: 3@D=16-18hcp|pg||
nt|lelos: mistell|pg||
nt|zlatan: he makes with @h lead also|pg||
nt|eleni: @h return?|pg||
nt|haans: screens and online = pressure on|pg||
nt|flash: (some will have both a check-back and a sign-off sequence available)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 2 ended one trick better for E-W in the Open Room|pg||
nt|chick: 5@H ok if he can pick up the @HQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  3@D - szybki claim, swÃ³jka|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ³yk tu?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so he is stuck|pg||
nt|Gerben42: she|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - weak two|pg||

nt|zbig1959:  szansik na obkÅad na promocji @S, zalezy jak rozegra atu rozgrywajÄcy..(nasi muszÄ wczeÅniej zgraÄ dwie lewki @C) |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: now an attempt to catch up|pg||
nt|MolvaM: eleni said EW are sweet ladies, so they wont trick us :)|pg||
nt|haans: imps to NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: might make it if the D stays away from the @D suit|pg||
nt|zoh:  2NTkalo symbolaio|pg||
nt|eleni: beware of the sweet ladies:):)|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been better to pop an honor card from table|pg||
nt|zoh:  :) Sosta Eleni|pg||
nt|jcone: good sacrifice in 5 hearts   not found by Christnitsa|pg||
nt|othered1: north thinking that double might be Lightner?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: they always know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso, by the end of this tournament, Frank will speak Greek:)|pg||
nt|lelos: 50 years ago this would be a passed out board i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't we happy that things have happen at the bridge:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Nickkkkkkkkkkkkkk pls play|pg||
nt|rodal f: The nick name was Nick?:)|pg||
nt|eleni: nickd|pg||
nt|eleni: and yes Frank 12 and a dbltn|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it was 13HP. Later they conted doubbletons etc.|pg||
nt|eleni: remember pls our good old Goren:):)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by that time not with a honor included. It came later.|pg||
nt|eleni: and then Albarran and his 5-cards majors and canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Director called by W for delay by S|pg||
nt|lelos: this is standard for N/S|pg||
nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||
nt|haans: @D right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: 5 imps to the Dutch :)|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S was allowed to make on Board 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: S left the table to visit the toilet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: or bathroom, whatever is better English :P|pg||
nt|flash: we'd think that North had a plan in mind when he continued with 3@C|pg||
nt|flash: but, having found that the partnership has two 8-card fits, he's apparently thinking of bidding more|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I expect many players to open the east hand, then hard to stop before 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: @C right|pg||
nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They get 200 here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  But not with this shift|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think the 3 small @Hs and the lack of shortness would deter him, but...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: our E is hoping to win the J in hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petrosa: after this lead he wii not make it|pg||
nt|flash: interesting (and unanticipated)|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  don't want to punish partner for a non-vul intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: some may consider 2 @H with W hand |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|petrosa: without dbl-Mr Karlaftis is afraid?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: WD|pg||
nt|eleni: was worth the thinking?|pg||
nt|jcone: P misclicked?   now makes |pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi tez|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi tez |pg||
nt|tez: hi Bob ve merhaba molvam:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: defense will have a chance later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now it's just the ruff in @S left for EW|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|zoh:  Kai tora @d|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome Tez:):) we have been waiting for you:)|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, being 'on air' may add to the anxiety tremendously|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: nothing is easier than errors in defense|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: to get 9 needed deep @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: lack of entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @D2 is a key card for the late entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: sad |pg||
nt|othered1: another fine result for NS|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|eleni: Kalispera Taso|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|lelos: Kalispera se olous|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 8a ta perase se ligo, twra den prolavainw|pg||
nt|petrosa: spade ruff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: ta xerw ta score, se ligo 8a ta deite|pg||
nt|lelos: if he ruffs a spade he cant go down|pg||
nt|loganrun: 43 imps on the first 3 boards - NS stopped in 6C in the other room.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They could not find out about the third round heart control, and were not running on adrenalin|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 4 was flat - down to 11 imps a board :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now @D shift was in order, happy camping for EW now|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|haans: had been my choice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another example - why not duck the @S King???|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Stylish approach is to run @C5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|haans: bidding was not Big Clubs style|pg||
nt|haans: more Acol style|pg||
nt|flash: use it or lose it...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcphee: so N was sleeping and did not notice the small @C or S has the carding wrong:)|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcphee: now we have an over trick|pg||
nt|zoh:  Afoy den brethike i amyna pire poly kako score o B-N|pg||
nt|eleni: 2|pg||
nt|eleni: good girls:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this means some of the 3NT bidders will make their contract too|pg||
nt|eleni: only on a similar play Murat:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be delighted with 180 myself|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult to play diamonds after east opens 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2min break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that is true, but on the @C play S shows not interest so what is left?|pg||
nt|eleni: you are so right Bob|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but eleni said they all play udca no?|pg||
nt|zoh:  Nai ta koritsia piran 2 poly kala score apo 2 poly kaloys paiktes|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Murat, they do|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||
nt|mcphee: but, crafty E is so proud her 2@D bid worked out so well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: At operating seat, John Manios, new addition to our vugraph team :)|pg||
nt|eleni: mix them up:) but girls never get mixed up:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right, there are rumors that girls mix men up|pg||

nt|sybarra: looks like support X |pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: now east alerts and west panics|pg||
nt|Gerben42: oh 1@S was a transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or does it have an other meaning?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Precision-style natural 2@C, articial 2@D enquiry|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many would have tried it but ...|pg||
nt|chick: not nice to be on lead against a strong NT when you have scattered unsupported honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west has over stated the values of this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: half the fun then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still a peaceful contract|pg||
nt|eleni: by N-S of course:)|pg||

nt|petrosa: -1|pg||
nt|zlatan: no reopening??|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have problems unveiling their strength|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ani w czarny ani w czerwony|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: East knows that pd never has anything|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2nt did show extra|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6xx|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure last hand was all luck.  EW's funny methods had set NS up for a big fall, but they weren't able to capitalize on it.  Says something about their methods and judgment ...|pg||
nt|othered1: to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees stated X on 3@s would be penalty, v Prooijen wasn't sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from E? I think he have to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: This is the 3th time I operate a match played by them, and in all these matches they frequently fail on their system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 31C denying a 4card major, 3@D general force, I guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
nt|chick: I think I would have led a small trump, under the theory that anything else would give away a trick|pg||
nt|haans: many would have lead the single :))|pg||
nt|haans: hard to make|pg||

nt|sybarra: or "cards" |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "do something smart pard" X |pg||
nt|loganrun: Need to play 3NT and not 5C - this is tough|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  OH - 5 @C - no make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did it|pg||
nt|flash: North's X apparently shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|loganrun: Well done|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - 3@D asks for a singleton|pg||
pc|c5|nt|flash: Board 4 turned into a 2-IMP gain for Netherlands!!  E-W reached 5@D in the Open Room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had made it more difficult for the declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead would have, but why should north find it, since south didn't really bid @D, just transferred to @H, I think.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Redv=bl presumably 1st round control, so 3NT was easy after all|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|loganrun: Great lead but for nought|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  dobrze ze dlugoÅÄ @C jest w rece W, inaczej 3nt byloby -1, zas koncowka w czerwony =|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: maksowy kontrakt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: W thinking and check CC of NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 the 4 spades played from other side,  making 4 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 5imps to Israel on Board 5 where they stopped in 3@C and made 11|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  maxowym byloby 6@D , chyba|pg||

mc|10|nt|liarakos: no swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than playing @s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: no clue|pg||
nt|othered1: west still needs to find the winning @D play and I'm not sure low to 10 is the best in a vacuum.  We'll have to see what other information he has at that point.|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  6@D, 2@H, bitka @H , 2@S (na impasie) = 11, zaÅ 12 na sqz w czarne p/ko W (tylko wist pikowy by zerwaÅ sqz)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Other room - @H-lead and @D-finesse|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt by NORTH|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: (players discussing last board :))|pg||
nt|othered1: west too the "in a vacuum" play for 3 tricks on this holding.  There were other considerations,  however|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet another big hand for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: and west would know that diamonds are her best friend anyway|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand is a problem for 'standard' bidders|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Championship for this table|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H-3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate that west hand for 1N, but need a hep partnership to open otherwise.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: no no sry|pg||
mb|d!|an|!s|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is 3N:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma starts with 1@D in order to have a rebid should partner respond 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this nt is really heavy at the front|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma will discourage a @D continuation (?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not finding his hand attractive |pg||
nt|warrens:  so W has 17+ with a least 5 @S's |pg||
nt|warrens:  nice to have a strong club to get out quickly|pg||
nt|loganrun: This 3NT is going to be hard to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @D position for NT is unlucky for 5@C.  Best spot single dummy is 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: yes he was|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
nt|flash: note the lead of the K - an attempt to hold the lead and let partner tell you what to do next|pg||
nt|flash: so West's cards should be suit preference, with a middle card suggesting a continuation of @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: they seem to play low disc, as paulissen already held the @h4|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if the partnership is on the same wave length|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on 4-3(!)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
nt|othered1: And with the right partner you might get there if you can squeeze a 1@H opening out of the west hand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You and I will lead @DA, but only because we can see all 4 hands :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: My money's on @HQ|pg||
nt|loganrun: I must admit that it is way down on the pecking order|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
nt|flash: good shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  I always say: it's ok to think, even if there's nothing to really consider|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it went 2 @C my guess it would go X,  and the doubling would start |pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
nt|othered1: Here niether major was ever in play.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not the time to look for overtricks - never give them a second chance|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to ju¿ w dzisiejszych czasach z rêk¹ W nie mo¿na zalicytowaæ zwyk³e 2@H?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but here that danger didÂ´nt exist - S had bid NT allready|pg||
nt|haans: withour @D bid from W|pg||
nt|othered1: Though this is a h and that would challenge most methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: question Warren, is how much energy to expend on this sort of hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: N wants @d|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma couldn't be sure that the @D was cashing, so he shifted|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, so the diamond bid was kinda necessary, even if only to direct the lead|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now we know that west is a certified overbidder|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  moze po X, "normalne" 2@H byÅoby za sÅabe w stosunku to potencjaÅu rÄki ??    :) |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  if W finesses, S gets another ruff, that's why he went up|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: some say attiude lead better at nt for not tell if 4-4 of 5-3 in suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale nie by³o kontry tylko 2 trefl|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ghionis: bad timing for altinis he went down in this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: so reccomended is Q@C now not 10:)|pg||
nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees uses a Stop card for alerting :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: brd 4 as i said W did open 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess i know him good enough then :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: KJ@D right cards for S|pg||
nt|warrens:  W must be thinking about 3N or X.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: and lost 4 imps:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: What to bid with East - I think his 2D is correct (suit quality) but 6C is now impossible to reach - (position of QD sort of telegraphed on the opening bid)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 2NT would be a bit of a distortion|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if Jansma cuebids he will surely rebid 3@D, since introducing a new suit generally shows extras|pg||
nt|loganrun: When I say impossible - much more difficult - although Jansma is opposite a partner who made a vul 2 over 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With these 2 nothing is impossible|pg||
mb|d!|an|!h|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity we don't know what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess 6@D makes on the same finesse|pg||
nt|loganrun: Yes it does of course|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petrosa: -2 but you never know:)|pg||
nt|haans: assume x was negative |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'll try to find out when I have time|pg||
nt|aldek: club bids were all relays|pg||
nt|aldek: but you need an agreement about the redouble, another relay or a proposition to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: ahh transfer bids:)|pg||
nt|tez: lead directing may be:)|pg||
nt|eleni: how very true Bob:) All of them are Greeks:):)|pg||
nt|haans: pass 6+|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, denying points :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry they won 4imps:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
nt|flash: if 1@D showed @Hs (as seems likely), South's X probably shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|aldek: you can make 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|aldek: 6 in both spades and diamonds is doomed|pg||
nt|aldek: Kwiecien has a choice, show his diamonds or set spades as trumps|pg||

nt|cicus: bd6 suggested EW were playing natural system but now it seems I was wrong and it's a strong club|pg||
nt|warrens:  avoided taking a unilateral position.  but 5@C will be down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: a red flag works too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: only 7 top tricks with poor @C break.  Let's see how declarer attacks the 8th.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Maybe an medieval cannon will do it too|pg||
nt|warrens:  3N would have been down at least 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  North very disciplined not to bid 4@S over the neg X|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S = weak 4@S = firm|pg||
nt|chick: Multumiri, Riinu :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to have been a @C-lead in OR|pg||
nt|chick: always nice to know what's going on besides the bridge :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: no cost as it happens|pg||
nt|eleni: a good save in 6@d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes that would have been -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: both rooms were in 6 @S on bd 5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @H to beat this?|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, North has shown @H length and South 3-card spt, Jansma will find it|pg||
nt|flash: if, instead, the meaning of the bids is different, there's no particular reason to lead the suit|pg||
nt|aldek: now they will reach a slam|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||
nt|eleni: and a bad X|pg||
nt|bmkl: nice agressive bid by Fotis|pg||
nt|cicus: can't be either (no X from west)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: A good shot but only for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: so I am totally in the dark|pg||
nt|haans: this is good bridge Strong clubs and opps bid game|pg||
nt|chick: besides the bidding and play :P|pg||
nt|warrens:  E thinking how to make this assuming the @H K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean off side k of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wait till he finds @C 4/1 |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he's has to assume it's onside and still would have work to do.  of course, here it will be more a matter of not going down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: going to go check on poland match  be back shortly |pg||
nt|warrens:  if the heart K is onside, the best line might be to take an immediate heart finesse, and assuming it works, cash the heart Ace and ruff a heart High|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@H probably kickback - control ask. Otherwise 4@S is a Zia cuebid|pg||
nt|loganrun: I wonder what 4D was?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it is spring - a time for optimism|pg||
pc|d8|nt|aldek: mam jeszcze troche pracy i wiecej czasu na brydza|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcphee: or E would be bidding @H|pg||
nt|haans: will lose imps here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|mcphee: S needs to find a @C now|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this line has the advantage of not needing hearts to break.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anther 5 imps to Israle on Board 6 when the Netherlands 'sacrificed' in 6@D over 5@S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: is there anything but bridge?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petrosa: when the two pairs play the same suit, someone is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: about the 6th board:wrong explanations given at the table. not sure of details|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry that there was 3S for a while, it's 5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: yes, but I can not guess what E-W would have done, had Karlaftis bid 6@d|pg||
nt|haans: Trommel do not understand that play|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: oh, I see, you were joking with us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: is this real?|pg||
nt|cicus: west ducked @S10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm sorry I lost this game|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem|pg||
nt|haans: not really|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eleni: let's hope Maria Panagaki won't return a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: normal result|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: defence dropped a few tricks here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W refused to lead a @S and now it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bmkl: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|eleni: exactly but I suppose this will be a swing|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||
nt|flash: on Board 7, 3@S was other-sided in the Open Room and came home - 8 more IMPs to Netherlands|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petrosa: now we know who is wrong|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  DRijver jeszcze sprawdziÅ czy przypadkiem nie roluje QJ@D (sec) i -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lelos: 3nt by maestro was the one that lured n/s|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|eleni: Maria is a very sweet lady|pg||
nt|mcphee: once a @H is not played E should have a good idea what is going on|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: misclick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: final spot was right after a couple of misbids:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: -2 nv against 3NT vuln is ok|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So after their horrific start they have been fighting back - but that result looks a bit ominous|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  I like a spade now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petrosa: in all times|pg||
nt|lelos: -2 is 6 back to sapounakis|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: why misbids|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Bridge in Poland always good, one of them is my clubmate in South Carolina USA, Mr Lukasz Lebioda, another one is in neighbor state, Mr Jerzy Zaremba..maybe one day these juniors ...|pg||

nt|eleni: in West|pg||
nt|tez: if one makes a mistake it can be costly but when opps follow suit it can always neutralize|pg||
nt|eleni: at the open table just a 3@c+1|pg||
nt|lelos: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Thanassis:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Last board for today. See you tommorow :)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a lost opp for EW in other room|pg||
nt|petrosa: usally it is not good habit to lead A in no trump without good suit|pg||
nt|ghionis: terrible result i think|pg||
nt|cicus: I apologize for disturbing you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, no way to make it with heart K offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: possible failing slam here|pg||
nt|ghionis: they have to wait for Argyrou result now|pg||
nt|cicus: good result for NS in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mcphee: 6@S has a slight chance|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt (@H lead)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed Bod and so did the other table 6@h-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: but any slam should fail|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@S also fails, but it is a better spot than 6@H|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h -4c shd avoid slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||
nt|mcphee: too many controls in s hand|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  they should be in 6, playing Polish club|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3n spade lead down|pg||
nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@c must include 19-20 NT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c 18 19 bal or..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H is puzzling *g|pg||
nt|harmon: shd get to 5h|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Usibg 2@D for majors over 1@C allows you to bis clubs naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: or south is overbidding :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 19 4@H Dbl|pg||
nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Gooed morning everyone |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another splinter, from North this time|pg||
nt|loganrun: South wishing he hadn't opened|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  hm, ciÄÅ¼kie otw (sÅabe 2) na dwÃ³ch asach.. pewnie 3M |pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: we've confirmed that 1@D on the last hand was an xfer to @Hs; given Jansma's lead, we'd assume that South's X showed values, not necessarily 3-card @H spt|pg||
nt|othered1: are we into a relay structure?  Can anyone translate?|pg||
nt|aldek: 2@D means hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Good morning|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a good day - playing @S to one looser - we get 110|pg||
nt|aldek: hallo David|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
nt|othered1: has that look to it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't 1@C show 5 spades and 4 minor a while ago?|pg||
nt|loganrun: Double from East? - no|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: That was 2@C|pg||
nt|chick: oh, sorrrryyyy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its interesting to me how often a trump lead against these partscore deals is right--even with a dangerous holding|pg||
nt|aldek: will go down 1 or 2, but both 2@H and 3@D make easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb (old English proverb)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W doesn't want to play game even against 14 from P|pg||
nt|loganrun: What is the Scottish equivalent Liz - does it involve haggis?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
nt|othered1: They do canape with some openers.|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S looks as good a spot as any, especially with the @S pips.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the tradidional play in @s with a small from dummy when W is declarer:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it is simply neutral to lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
nt|flash: if anyone can find a link to the N-S convention card, some of these mysteries might be solved   :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very few things involve haggis :) Just as well, really|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  impas @S, odpadajÄca 2ga Q@H lub T@H (albo podziaÅ @H 3-3) i 10 lew|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks if S plays @sK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||
nt|eleni: Let's hope Aris Filios will think of the @c slam|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Animesh:) welcome:)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ty:) sry running late here:)|pg||
nt|eleni: We finally arrived at the last board for this evening@h@h TY all for been here with us, thx George also and thx to our today's operators, Effi+Giannis and of course the Hellenic ...|pg||
nt|eleni: Bridge Federation@h@h|pg||
nt|haans: body wouth a lot|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And now the diamond switch|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  X z pozycji W daje szanse  ze ma duÅ¼o, tzn AK@D tez .. daleka dorga do 10 lew|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what east knows at th is point and why west is thinking? |pg||
nt|othered1: What leeway would west have in an auction like this, unless he feels it has gone off the tracks somewhere?  Or do I totally misunderstand what's been going on here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W cannot play the mathematical correct way (run @s9) because of too few entries|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's not a terrible opening bid, with 4-4 in the Majors - but it is being punished|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2 flat boards on 7&8 - down to a mere 7 imps a board after a flying start|pg||
nt|loganrun: Rise ace and play on clubs - damage control|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spoke too soon - 15 imps to Netherlands on 9 when North was alloed to play 4@H-3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Opened 4@H - good effort IMO|pg||
nt|loganrun: Board 9 - 4H passed out - for another 15 for the Dutch|pg||
nt|loganrun: It certainly worked well on the hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if he rises @DA here East can hold off @CA and he has no quic entry to dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
nt|othered1: of course a @C lead beats slam, no matter how declarer plays trumps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW are in the best contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lelos: another push|pg||
nt|animeshraj: wow!|pg||
nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
nt|othered1: To understand the defense, we need to know what west has shown, it might be very explicit.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: west showed 3415|pg||
nt|othered1: any specifics on high cards/controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: with 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: so what would west have been thinking of over 4@S?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no possible entry to N hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for 140|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zbig1959:  ufff, poszÅo :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: If there is any children here. Put them at an other room for some minuts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: He wasn't sure what he did show, dummy explained it to all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But knocking out West's entry was a good shot|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cicus: still a hurdle|pg||
pc|cA|nt|maj_gr:  haha|pg||
nt|cicus: can play west, the overcaller for @DAK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: playing very fast|pg||
nt|haans: odd play in hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a @D-lead would have been no better|pg||
