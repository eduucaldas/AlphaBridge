nt|ady: this seems a bidable slam|pg||
nt|snorris: another 9 tricks @s contract|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now we circle back to 1 and pick up comparisons from the CR.|pg||
nt|ady: norths diamond pips were too good|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: Leading to 3NT without any entry in your hand, from KQ9xxx low is usually best, from KQ10xxx high (king) is usually best|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Another 3NT for EW ... but NS still have some bidding to do|pg||
nt|bg: another one here where 3 is the limit|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|ady: opportunity for GT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: Corrected sorry|pg||
nt|benjent: What do you open with the North hand Peter?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@H 1@S 2NT and then slamtry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 0-4 with 4 spades probably|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Is 4@D too much now?|pg||
nt|icechem: only 9 tricks in NT seems little|pg||
nt|ady: dimond slam for n/s|pg||
mb|2S!|an|5!H and 2!S|nt|Walddk6: I don't think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: red suits splitting nicely  n/s have 12 tricks in either red suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N ever be able to show his @d holding?|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5-loser hand, but no second suit to provide a source of tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This would deny a singleton or void in my methods, but ...|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|ady: key is the quality of east's doubleton spade backing up the 6 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: should pass ..too many loosers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if that's a 3@S bid, North had better be careful |pg||
nt|icechem: now south pumps for info|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@S or 1@D = a matter for each partnership to decide. In the olden days, people used to pass the North cards, but not many exeptrts do that nowadays|pg||
nt|petergill: I open 1@D, unless my partnership style and agreement demands that I open 1@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and you, Ben?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think 1@d for me. With 5@h and a long minor, I like to get the major on the table, but I always feel with @s I'm the boss of the auction |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on the West cards is normal. You just hope (expect?) that partner will have the side suits under control, or that there will be a blockage or wrong defence|pg||
nt|benjent: Mostly, I would like to open the one partner has the best fit for, but that's not so easy to arrange :)|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very awkward|pg||
nt|benjent: There's was blockage on the last hand, and there's a distinct lack of defensive communication on this hand too|pg||
nt|petergill: @H6 likely to be 4th best, so @H8 will win|pg||
nt|april7: whats wrong with the 2NT bid?|pg||
nt|bg: tough to resist bidding 4;)|pg||
nt|icechem: they might go for it|pg||
mb|3H|an|4!D and 2!C|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|snorris: 17hp|pg||
nt|snorris: 18 rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I don't think you *must* bid with 10 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Declarer can place the key cards right now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is planning what to do after that|pg||
nt|andyv:  problem with @d opener in precision.... just too difficult to describe this hand...N could have bid 2@d and then shown @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk6: You also have the option of making 2NTrebid game-forcing. Then you can distinguish between different hand types|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: seems like reopening X is taken at full value by E|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h is a tad pushy|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy are in short supply|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h lead irritatingly takes out his entry to the board|pg||
nt|benjent: Various endplay possibilities ... declarer will spend some time working his way through them|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H seems rushing the auction and does north have to have 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 2@h showed 5@h and as long or longer @ds?|pg||
nt|mamos:  artificiality seems to be getting in the way here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South known to have @HKJ, so North must have @SQ, @CK and @DA for the opening bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  otherwise, bid doesn't make sense (why wouldn't N open 1@h?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT takes up too much bidding room, Avram. 2@C is more economical in order to explore further|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Believe me, Gazzilli is worth learning|pg||
nt|icechem: he didn't dare go above 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Jón did not give partner a chance in the other room when he rebid 2NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos:  this is better than in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everything Garozzo has been involved in is worth learning|pg||
nt|Walddk6: He did not think 6542 were worth mentioning|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Not much of a suit, I agree, but ...|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 2@C was a game-forcing relay|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||
nt|benjent: Interest @d pitch ... I'd be thinking North is 5053 as a working plan |pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: usual procedure is allow some leeway and let doubler do the pushing|pg||
nt|ady: even adfter 2NT re-bid  some difficulty   east could have had a number of other cards and not J@S|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: North covering with @SQ suggests North has @S9 - with @SQ7xxx North might duck @SJ, in case declarer has 5 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this doesn't have any fast losers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: looks as if East was contnet to raise a transfer to 2@S in the other room - counting points let him stop at a safe level|pg||
nt|dburn: and on this lead it might even have enough winners|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Trump lead would have been best for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk6: This makes Karl's task much easier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It was the last hand where a diamond was the best lead...|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it makes it easier - how much easier I am not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk6: As they have not set up a club trick, declarer can let @DJ ride|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It has not reached 'easy' yet, though it is makeable|pg||
nt|dburn: lead was understandable - declarer had not bid diamonds, and North could imagine suits  breaking well for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: so he led aggressively, trying to set up a diamond trick when partner got in with something|pg||
nt|dburn: and in a sense he succeeded - he set up a lot of diamond tricks, but not for his side, alas|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A normal line appears to pitch a club and let @DJ run if not covered|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|rhelle: conventional wisdowm is to play partner for around 7 points|pg||
nt|mamos:  look like they will bid now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you have the boss suit, you may get a chance to compete later|pg||
nt|icechem: NS will get an imp or 2 |pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: intrafinesse the heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: The @s pitch is ok for East ... now he can cash @s's|pg||
nt|petergill: Good club switch, having worked out that East is 4441|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjent: Yes, prematurely killed one of East's endplay options (play @cA and another one late in the game)|pg||
nt|benjent: East should cash @hA at his next chance - put the squeeze on a very uncomfortable North|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: a play first made famous by Gabriel Chagas in a BOLS bridge tip about 25 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: north opened 1@H CR and later bid diamonds twice|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Not sure it is right to ruff this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland. However, you can see them in the player profiles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you bid to this excellent slam after a 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|ady: safest contract is 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW had the same method available in the other room but stopped short anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|nt|rhelle: well done|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, if you bid like that you've got to play very well|pg||
nt|joest: with all three spade honors in the slot it turns out there is no guess|pg||
nt|ady: cant understand only 9 tricks CR|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Most likely Fisk will need a good result in this match in order to qualify for tomorrow's final|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Grant Thornton and Verðbréf are through|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: GT and Málning|pg||
nt|icechem: he got a spade lead there and finessed clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: 2@C opening and 2NT (jump)rebid are hopeless in a natural system|pg||
nt|mamos:  well i know the value of gazzilli but after 2Nt I'd bid 3@S which for me would be forcing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cuttysark: 3rd and 5th leads make it hard to read the position of the honour cards, but I think he had to run the diamond, or preserve J10|pg||
nt|dburn: it wasn't - I don't see how he can succeed from here|pg||
nt|Walddk6: How did he expect to come to 12 tricks with this line?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: after 2NT rebid  3@S ok if forcing   otherwise 3@D then 3@H   and then 3@S?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: welldone indeed|pg||
nt|benjent: watching carefully ... :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk6: Right, that's what I means to say, sorry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: he's going to need the doubleton @s10 now|pg||
nt|Walddk6: *meant|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: It should be, yes Mike, but does it promise six cards?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if that @s8 had lived, he would have been OK - @cA and a high cross-ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|benjent: North could have done a bit better by putting the @dJ on the 10, rather than taking the A|pg||
nt|benjent: snap|pg||
nt|andyv:  would seem to be an easier way to handle this hand|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It could be a fiver looking for three-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Skafti knows all these players very well although he (Skafti) has been living in Copenhagen for (how many?) years now?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Many is all I know|pg||
nt|jcwla: So first blood to N/S.|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Wrong slam in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 6 of either minor is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East's good play was as is expected of a member of the Iceland National Open Team p|pg||
nt|bg: 3 spades is the correct Bergen call with 4 trumps and a very weak holding N had 5 losers no guarantee that siouth would cover two of them|pg||
nt|skaftij: I am a countryman to the players, but actually I don't know so much about their systems |pg||
nt|skaftij: soon 30 years|pg||
nt|icechem: this should be a good hand for the relay|pg||
nt|ady: 2 making slams   chose wrong suit CR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: good save found in CR|pg||
nt|cicus: W might easily make a mighty leap here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may buy the contract in a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure I understand the auction in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Could North have figured declarer would have tried @c10 if he had a 2nd @c? Then he might have figured out the 4441|pg||
nt|petergill: NS with 25 HCP cannot make 3Nt but might make an unlikely-to-be-reached 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D by west shows 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|mamos:  i think West will take control  18-19 opposite good six carder 14 points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you want to be in it opposite  xx  in spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was not a random doubleton|pg||
nt|april7: a weak 2 opener by E might have helped to reach a @D sacrifice bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S by West???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT by South??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With all those defensive values|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange...|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|skaftij: Sævar and I were in the same Bridge team as teenagers|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Sævar and Karl also lived in Denmark at some point. And Magnús in Sweden|pg||
nt|jcwla: Chance to go up 18-0.|pg||
mb|2S!|an|5!S and 2!H|nt|benjent: Harsh that East has both @d honours|pg||
nt|mamos:  North has a slightly heavy 1Nt but when South bids @h ......  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South did well to get our for down 1 in 3@S X in CR   must of got a heart lead    quuen of clubs dropped in 1  and got diamond right|pg||
nt|ady: queen of clubs dropped in 2|pg||
nt|snorris: the east in closed room is a member of the parliament(Althingi) Jón Birkir Jónsson|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there seems to be a strange fascination about doing lots of bidding when holding one king|pg||
nt|snorris: he bid 4 @s with good  result|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|icechem: he like hearing about only 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: Verobref  bound to get a good swing   they can even miss the small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: With a double stopper in hearts and no singletons not void, visualising that 5@d is better than 3NT (due to the weak @D's)  is almost impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: nor voids, I meant|pg||
mb|3D!|an|4!C and 2 !D|nt|rhelle: X = GF, by the way|pg||
nt|petergill: the doubler at the other table got a bit lucky that his partner took all the tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij: forcing NT lead to 4@h|pg||
mb|3H|an|relay|nt|benjent: South bid @c's in his auction, and his partner opened 1@h, so I guess figured the oppos had bid a tight game breaking badly|pg||
nt|ady: this may well go down 1|pg||
nt|april7: played from S only 4 @H so 5@D is enough sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have done well to find their diamond fit   I think a weak 2 by west would have kept east out of the bidding|pg||
nt|april7: on @C lead only 1 down|pg||
mb|3N!|an|4 controls|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
nt|snorris: not that I agree with the bid...far from it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Neat, control asking now|pg||
nt|icechem: then he asks where they are|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 3NT  4 controls    2 aces   1 ace and 2 kings   or 2 kings|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 4 kings|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Note how much the Multi 2@D damaged N-S in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Before they knew it, EW were in 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk6: No room to explore|pg||
nt|ady: east opened a multi in CR snd south overcalled 2@S   thereafter north took control  and went to 6@S|pg||
nt|icechem: Jón is thinking through whether to go above 3NT|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, it seems to work very well|pg||
nt|joest: Another Eric Rodwell creation|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead will do the job|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a distinguished spot|pg||
nt|skaftij: seen better|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Needed a lot, getting nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Or 2@H.|pg||
nt|ady: though room was taken up with a bounce of 4@H by west|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: X forbids @D???|pg||
nt|mamos:  This is perhaps the downside of 1@S|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rhelle: the trouble is that we see these gadgets on display when operated by very fine players|pg||
nt|rhelle: and then it all looks very easy :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: this play may well help east to play a heart to the king rather than the normal play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only nation with a 100% record: qualified once and won i|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not bad for a nation with around 310,000 inhabitants|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: we will be back|pg||
nt|mamos:  When I watch bridge from Iceland I'm always impressed by the tough standard|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|april7: should not continue @C, but @D,else it would reveal the Q of trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  east may perhaps have done that with x|pg||
nt|april7: might reaveal|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: W is rhinking wether to ruff and try cashing a @D,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Magnús wondering if partner could be void in spades (ruffing this trick). Unlikely when he plays the ace|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: looks South needs to woodenly continue @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: now another spade -- and N's @C9 might come into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: my kind of defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: he know that the @h Ace (if North has it) can't run away|pg||
nt|rhelle: he also knows that North is relatively balanced|pg||
nt|rhelle: my money is on him playing the @sQ next|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: The play of Bd 1 at the other table bore no resemblance to the play at our table, but the outcome was the same|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I guess everyone knows where Iceland is located after the recent weeks, but if you don't, here is some info ...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk6: Iceland is a country in northern Europe in the North Atlantic Ocean between the rest of Europe and Greenland. It has a population of about 315,000 and a total area of 103,000 km². ...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|benjent: The CR played 2@h by EAST. East responded 1@h to 1@d, which I guess involved some system|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  I guess if they were vul they might make more of an effort|pg||

nt|bg: NS currently 2nd in Round Robin EW are 6th|pg||
nt|snorris: this is hard to win|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would be better if North has som more clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Transfer responses to fairly standard 1@C opening|pg||
nt|petergill: if so, 1@S would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: it does|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT min bal, 2@C some form of checkback|pg||
nt|andyv:  they probably play 3@d as GF... so maybe 2N is the best invite they have with this hand|pg||
nt|snorris: thought west would bid 2 @s but no|pg||
nt|bg: more sensible than N in other room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: 2NT South appears to show a weak raise in hearts|pg||
nt|icechem: yes, but with 4 I assume|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: North would surely bid on with  ace king ace outside a 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|ady: south passed  originally so can hardly be game forcing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|benjent: So the contract and declarer is replicated. How entertaining!|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D might show a minimum, then 2@H = 3 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 2 NT is mixed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: well this lead solvesone problem for declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: South's strong diamond holding over East's likely long @d's suggests a trump lead might be best|pg||
nt|andyv:  true....so your 3@d bid seems pretty automatic|pg||
nt|skaftij: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rhelle: this is good bidding|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bg: should prevail with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|skaftij: serious?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two-suited 2@S was no success for the Russians in the closed room, but that does not mean that it is bad. It just led to the wrong contract on this occasion|pg||
nt|skaftij: slam try|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: I think it must be - I suppose he has a lot of high cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: I think so|pg||
nt|Walddk6: No matter what, slam would have been better if played by North where diamonds are protected, but here it does not matter. It's just dead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They are not the high cards partner wants, but he canot know that|pg||
nt|icechem: a good stop for Fisk|pg||
nt|icechem: but will he play dia wrong?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos:  club lead when in with @H    (and a Spade lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Bruce. Are you all alone?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|rhelle: he needs a big cross-ruff, me thinks|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Sometimes you pre-empt your own side|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|cicus: but N took a position there that 2@S would be better than 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: a high cross ruff impending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I now hear that 2@S was explained as a strightforward weak 2, not two-suited|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: trump return here is best but won't be enough|pg||
nt|cicus: because you only looked at the spades|pg||
nt|benjent: The plain way to go about the hand is to try to ruff out @d's ... but that's quite committal|pg||
nt|benjent: Better to take some @s finesse first and see what happens|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec pointed out that 2@C might force 2@D, then 2@H show 3 hearts in an invitational hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: also while we are stressing that "pre-emopts work", we can note that even if EW are silent throughout it is far from obvious that NS would bid 6C, or even identify the big club fit ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3D probably not forcing, which seems like an underbid except that 1D could be short and then no game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has nopthing to think about here, so is prbably trying to remember his agreements|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlikely that it would be N thinking this long|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|dburn: likely to play South (if anyone) for three trumps to an honour and go only one down|pg||
nt|dburn: but this wasn't a great contract - still, most of what West has is pretty useless to East, what with none of it being aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: but do you play restricted choice if you take the @dK first|pg||
nt|dburn: and it wasn't so easy for East to judge that - after all, West did open the bidding|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Let me ask again: do you see any part scores in MOVIE?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: couldn't hold @cK with that|pg||
nt|Walddk6: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk6: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Walddk6: Fisk is outside top 4 now as we see|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk6: What??|pg||
nt|skaftij: a dull moment?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D = his xxx in spades must be opposite shortage (2 or less cards), so the bid is safer than it might look|pg||
nt|ady: and club suit of course|pg||
nt|april7: true! is 1NT not denying a card @S suit?|pg||

nt|joest: 4NT must have been something other than RKCB if north is thinking it over|pg||
nt|rhelle: I was young before this auction started|pg||
nt|joest: old school = "when I am weak I pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
nt|april7: why then E didn't bid 2@H immediately?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped safely   making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|tez: it will be hard to bid 3 nt if south would overcall with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  might also be hard for S to explain to teammates -800|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rhelle: and he simply cannot believe that it is 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: yet partner signed off over Blackwood.  Who to believe?  Muller A or Muller B?|pg||
nt|april7: S can' t possibly guess doubleton K of @S with W|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij: perhaps 2 rounds of @s would be annoying|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|snorris: looking like -2 now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h more of a mp bid I think|pg||
nt|tez: i would|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this 2@C is the same gadget as we saw yesterday, it is (a) a weak two in diamonds (b) weakish both majors (c) various strong hands |pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: 5@C as a save would be 500 or 800. East followed the good principle of not bidding (nor doubling 4@C) when you have nothing|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me tell you this. It would have taken my club members less time to avoid a slam off two cashing aces. You really need to be a World Class player to encounter a disaster like ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The part score is taking longer to play than any of the games. Lack of practice, perhaps?|pg||
nt|skaftij: finally a contract that has chances|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  it could work but 3-4-3-3 hands have never been a favorite of mine for overcalls|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos:  push then|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|bg: Since 2c might have been majors E probably should passed first round could always bid hearts later if N was not showing majors|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|benjent: North really just checking to see if anybody wants to throw a few @h's away|pg||
nt|andyv:  plus @H may not be @hs over a strong @c system|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk6: VÍS having a fine match against Haustak, so one of these two teams could be eliminated|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: Not tonight, Josephine, and this will be flat at 10 tricks|pg||

nt|petergill: the European Championship field at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm (then click on Participants) has a few surprises, e.g. no Fantoni - Nunes for Italy, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: no Helgemo - Helness for Norway|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting result in CR|pg||
nt|skaftij: NS cards fit well this time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|benjent: EW in the CR got a tad overenthusiastic and shelled out 200 for their trouble. Rates to be a small loss for them|pg||
nt|Walddk6: We have lapped the closed room|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent: Are Bocchi-Duboin-Sementa playing 3-way in the European?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Contract there is 3@C|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: I regard N-S as World Class, and *when* they err, it may lead to disasters|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what went wrong there.  Obviously it went back to the original response if it promised controls he didn't have|pg||
nt|rhelle: That is my impression|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 another hard number to explain to teammates|pg||
nt|dburn: mayeb North owed South a raise at the other table - that's not a bad hand for spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: A quiet pass from N in the CR.|pg||
mb|2N!|an|ruben|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: It was probably optional blackwood as they call it|pg||

nt|petergill: previous round. Does anyone else play that? |pg||
nt|ady: nothing much for e/w    but surely will do better than -1600|pg||
nt|ady: without a heart lead 6@S can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  North chhose to double in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Looks like it, for Italy|pg||
nt|icechem: NS can make 3 spades it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Agree, North was passive in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I think South has to shorten his trumps as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is what he is doing|pg||
nt|joest: i think east-west can come to four trump tricks|pg||
nt|joest: plus two sides|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as Khven does not crash partner's @HK, but why would he|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, simplest way is for E to  ruff  a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  much better... N needed to dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that won't exactly paralyse South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: particularly when South has nothing wasted in hearts, and diamonds break 3-3 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Perfect vulnerability for a raise to 2@S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: that lets EAST elope with the small trump, right|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be a 15 imp pick up|pg||
nt|ady: north might well have doubled  with his heart holding  and certainly would have done had he known of sing. jack|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did well to get away from @hs|pg||
nt|tez: If you has good suit chance of punishment will be less..i wouldnt overcall with this|pg||
nt|jcwla: Esp assuming they have a way to differentiate btn this and a good raise.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bg: good result by NS in other room may be tied here with W attacking hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skaftij: problem with bidding 2@c is that the strength is in the red suits and partner cannot judge his @c holding right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rhelle: ah, the eloping ... shades of Kelsey & Ottlik|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, now it looks more like down to me|pg||
nt|rhelle: now duck a trump?|pg||
nt|joest: will probablly ruff a club to hand|pg||
nt|joest: and make a spade play|pg||
nt|rhelle: he may want to wait with that entry|pg||
nt|joest: a 7 imp gain here via 2@h down one will let Netherlands regain the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Jack's line. Leave that trump in dummy for the time being|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA, ruff a club and a spade up|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: this looks like down 3   and even doubled  would have surprised e/w when they compare that -800 is a nice swing for them|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|tez: I'm talking about the accident in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone open W hand with other bid than 1@h?|pg||
nt|tez: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|ady: CR 1@H   P  P  Dbl   P    P   re-double  passed out|pg||
nt|april7: the 4@D bid is rather helpful for S! and with this lead or @D K 12 tricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - playing 5card majors 2@C does not look right unless it is artificial|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|ady: very difficult for south to visualize a slam after a 2@C overcall from north  even taking into consideration the 4@D splinter|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|benjent: That's a neat idea. I'm going to steal it instantly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: they have|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: i miscalculated the 7 imps sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: If Italy play as a team of five in Ostend, remember that Versace - Sementa and Bocchi - Duboin - Sementa all have partnership experience|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s9|nt|tez: 9 of @h suit  preferance|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|joest: oing the other way|pg||

nt|ady: low clu early and west might make 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|joest: now king and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: J@C now|pg||
nt|tez: or small @c|pg||
nt|tez: same 16 imp to ew|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|benjent: Is there a signal in there somewhere about the makeup of the Italian team next year? Are Bocchi-Duboin being encouraged to re-form?|pg||
nt|petergill: I learnt that idea from Michael Courtney, who never misses out on overcalling 1@S if he can. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|benjent: Did he explain the idea to you first, or did he just pull it on you at the table?|pg||
nt|april7: but an overcall could be up to 17-18 points|pg||
nt|ady: push|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tez: well down:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: however the slam does go down with a heart lead with all North's strength|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: in my system|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he will only score one more tump|pg||
nt|rhelle: now he has the count ... if @d were 3-3 East would have thrown it|pg||
nt|joest: if he thought @Ds 3-3 he should have cashed one a round ago :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: well yes :|pg||
nt|cicus: he should have done it anyway, ws only way to make|pg||
nt|joest: y|pg||
nt|joest: even though the spot cards suggested otherwise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny hand, S and E both want to be shortened in trumps|pg||
nt|joest: however I think that might have led to down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East will prevail|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes south can't avoid being thrown in|pg||
nt|cicus: S will lead @HQ|pg||
nt|cicus: has to try to pin singleton jack|pg||
nt|cicus: only way to come to 2 more trump tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5-card suit and a nice 'body'|pg||
nt|ady: west did well to make 2@D CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: He told me after I went minus 800, having balanced, against Fred Gitelman in the Cavendish about 10 years ago|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks seems a lot in CR  for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to run...ty everyone and enjoy the rest of the match|pg||

nt|april7: 1@D -1@H X XX 1@S - 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: something went seriously awry in the closed room|pg||
nt|benjent: I think it's often the case that partscores are interesting cardplay hands, because everyone usually has a bit of stuff and lots of flexibility|pg||

pc|d8|nt|petergill: 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|tez: ty|pg||
nt|jcwla: A link to many BOLS Bridge Tips: http://www.haroldschogger.com/bols1.htm |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|snorris: I would ..|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|benjent: So Michael assumed you knew the idea, bid accordingly and you had the pleasure of going for the number?|pg||
nt|april7: he is in the laww position with 2@S|pg||
nt|bg: one anyway:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle: he has another toy he wanted to show us :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jön gave up in the other room. Not obvious to come in, but partner did not punish him. Páll knws that 4@H might be a stretch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Even I, resistant to change as I am, have been converted (in 2010) to playing these transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and you just try telling Iceking what he can and what he cannot|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS have broken the law :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: well done n/s    the 1@D opening enabled them to compete over 2@S  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I do not think they can make this board exciting whatever they do|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead a trump?|pg||
nt|benjent: I play them, playing a version of Fantunes, but I don't think they're a great idea in a natural system|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 1@H is often a balanced minimum with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I had just bid badly (was I used to do), doubling 2@H on my 4225, and he was the one who went minus 800 in 3@DX|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: well here's a big swing back and this time I KNOW it's going to the Netherlands! :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not so sure ... he really should have led a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on that lead declarer is in deep trouble|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this will teach him not to intervene over a stron @c|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone would intervene over a strong club with THIS hand -- to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Dirk should change his explanation over 1NT as "No place to play" :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: same dilemma as yesterday - if he finesses and it loses, he may never see th @s Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one with shape bids|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: can still make even losing a heart ruff as 4th heart will be a discard for a losing club|pg||
nt|april7: on that lead S might go down|pg||
nt|april7: depends how S plays the trump suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: has finger on @D Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: should go down if playing Ace and another diamond  with a club switch|pg||
nt|april7: ace of @S  @D finesse @H and @H ruff and @C and 4th @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ragnar stole a couple of aces and kings from partner when he entered|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: as I used to do|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: on heart lead as well can only make 8 in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think 4@H is one of those things you have to do |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you never know, the defence against 1NT contracts is usually quite difficult|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|icechem: that is true|pg||
nt|ady: defence can prevail by cashing diamonds and switching to spade|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: Good way to learn the idea though :)|pg||
nt|april7: critical moment!|pg||
nt|ady: might play king   to rty for heart ruff|pg||
nt|ady: try|pg||
nt|april7: then S makes it, S makes a really good try the way he played it. E knows it also that the 4th @H becomes high so he will stay low|pg||
nt|april7: should|pg||
nt|skaftij: npoe|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: why heart pitches instead of clubs?|pg||
nt|rhelle: he'll try and ruff @cs in dummy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|joest: what chance that will happen?|pg||
nt|rhelle: somewhere between slim and none|pg||
nt|joest: but if lho had the ten ofhearts third you might score a heart trick on power|pg||
nt|xenya: all of them are losers so doesnt really matter it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: perhaps - you sure he wouldn't be trump short before that @h is established?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like this better - it forces defenders to play trumps|pg||
nt|joest: I wouldn't mind getting tapped|pg||
nt|joest: if opps hearts are 3-3 I might score another|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm with declarer on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori a double finesse in spades is the percentage play for one loser, but not after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure Ragnar will get it right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: The trouble may be that Karl thinks declarer has at least @SJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: east can signal to make it easy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rhelle: now a low @d?|pg||
nt|joest: y|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because without it he does not have 14 hcp|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bg: I agree you have to get in on a hope sometimes you sleep better when it works|pg||
nt|ady: has discouraged hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: natural way play @s and @s|pg||
nt|april7: after such a long thinking a switch is mandatory|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime the club spots are developing quite nicely for declarer after north understandably rose with the king|pg||
nt|joest: but on another club south rises, puts partner in with the heart ace and its stilldown 3|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's still going to be a bit of a train wreck - close to a swimming pool score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Karl has to assume that declarer has an upgraded 13 count|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer is a little unlucky that the spade honors are not split|pg||
nt|ady: presume udca  e/w   3@S  encouraging|pg||
pc|s4|nt|benjent: So the reason I'm not keen on transfer responses to 1@c in a natural(ish) system is that you hand an extra bid to the opponents, but the gain for your side is marginal|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Slightly awkward discard for South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 IMPs and a new leader|pg||
nt|petergill: but East had let a @h go, so OK|pg||
nt|icechem: @s 3 is pretty definitive |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|skaftij: perhaps it's like volcanoes, tension must build up slowly before erupting (again)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give and take. That 1@D overcall before made N-S overbid to a no-play slam, but it has been paid back here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: and it if doesn't....well, it's only one board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low club last hope for Sævar|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: will discard |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it will help, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 3@S on 3@C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators, Rob Helle, Jack Oest, Vladimir Ivanov, and Gábor Szöts|pg||

nt|xenya: good save in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||

nt|tez: 2@h enuf for me|pg||

nt|april7: 5@H only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT may show clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They also have to hope that Haustak takes a few more tricks against VÍS|pg||
nt|icechem: indeed but of course they don't know the situation in detail|pg||
mb|2H!|an|Short !D|nt|petergill: For intermedaite players: the declarer play technique of that hand was interesting, the diamonds can wait, try the spades first |pg||
nt|april7: bad X in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: One sensible option 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: e/w might buy it at the 5 level for _ 300|pg||
nt|ady: -300|pg||
nt|bg: hard to figure how EW only made 5 clubs in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You make slam if you are in it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer played a heart from hand|pg||
nt|snorris: not a bad slam|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjent: Slightly nervy in 3NT here as you try to diagnose the @d layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: North was probably hoping South might re-open with a double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade fit is found now|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S down 3 undoubled I am told|pg||
nt|rhelle: that another 11|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D now|pg||
nt|ady: south has unravelled his hand well as the bidding went|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij: I think east has a good lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - he could even afford to block the hearts when he has @CA as an entry|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West might find a hart lead against 5@C - then he needs to drop @SK|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: for down 1?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North should really bid 4@S, I think|pg||
nt|skaftij: might bid 4@d as offering a choice of games, if not taken as seeking slam|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   shows short diamonds |pg||
nt|icechem: I been been in that 5th place and I don't reccommend it :-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11-15  4414|pg||
pc|sT|nt|benjent: Less nervy 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is fairly conservative|pg||
nt|benjent: Some marriages wouldn't survive that bid :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S at the other table would have shown 3 hearts and 6+ @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: which is ideal|pg||
nt|mamos:  and West  has shown good judgement|pg||
nt|ady: possible to make 4@S   tight contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The recommended lead against a Marmic: trump|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: So that's 12 IMPs to Russia|pg||
nt|ady: problem with double   is it is unlikely partner can bid 3NT when that is the right contract|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow EW have taken a different approach in this room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11, right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I am told you are rigth Wald|pg||
nt|ady: fell on their feet|pg||
nt|snorris: they are cue bidding..|pg||
nt|snorris: so..|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: the problem with 11D - 11H - 3@D - 3NT is that you can miss a good 5-3 heart fit (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The original Marmic opening was 2@D to show this hand type|pg||
nt|icechem: It is quite important for HF to get 2nd place after Grant. Then they will play last match tomorrow and they will know what they need to win|pg||
nt|ady: this hand no favours for Fisk even though tigth game not bid|pg||
nt|ady: tight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4441 hands can't be bid accurately most of the time, so Mar(io) and Mic(helle) invented the 2@D opening. Franco and Giovine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the name MarMic|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|april7: good decision by E and S|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H surprising  by East|pg||
nt|april7: the 5@D bid made it happen|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will collect 500 but still lose on the board    |pg||
nt|april7: its the par contract|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Does double ask for any specific lead in your methods?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I double withe this West hand South has a singleton heart :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjent: Gazzilli is another pathway to solving these hands|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D - 1@H - 3@D - 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: East might have underbid to avoid this problem, to leave space to find hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: So 1@d-1@h-2@c if you play it that way (I do), then West does his "ok hand" thing and East can get his hand across|pg||
nt|ady: winning action by e/w was to pass out 5@S    that was difficult|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: west opened an 11 point 1NT CR   pass pass  double by south and thereafter  e/w scrambled to 2@D X  and got out for down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 3NT by south is a grey area    could be 16 pts   could be what he has   and could be more than what he has|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Or is it just  a "I-can-beat-this" double?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Still, AKJ10xxx and an ace will be 8 tricks often, so 2@D on such a suit is not my first choice|pg||
nt|april7: oh yes nobody is vuln.!|pg||
nt|april7: only 1 imp difference|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: And 8 to NL here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: I think it suggests you try something other than diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But should be prepared for any lead |pg||

pc|s8|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||

nt|skaftij: does this slam qualify as being OK Roland?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos:  and hitting the target|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sævar and Karl did not do much wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not everybody's overcall :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: "Get in with 2@C over 1@D if you have any excuse"|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: My partner and I play 1@D - 1@H - 2@S (or 1@D - 1@S - 3@H - a bit high, not ideal) as 3 card major support and 6+@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: Shows the upside of a Sabine Auken recommendation from _I Love This Game_: "Bid 2@C over 1@D even when it's not perfect."|pg||
nt|icechem: Jón Baldursson really loves close situations in the end. Now HF and Malning dead even for 2nd|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|benjent: Sure, useful method|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: 4@D looks an overbid to me -- W could be weaker i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: *4@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 4 trumps, singleton, 5-card suit ... I like it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do have 4@H   but were never in the bidding|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|cicus: my thoughts as well|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C bid - like it or loathe it?|pg||
nt|benjent: choke, cough, splutter|pg||
nt|Walddk6: The excuse is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW could have taken the first 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Plus side for 2@C = at fav vul, opponents often try to steal from you by opening light and responding light - so you might have 3NT on|pg||
nt|benjent: I bet North was wishing he'd passed 2@cX out when partner bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes that is what he said when he put down dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: EW continue to narrow the gap 33-23 after this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: no effect here - but on another hand can make it very difficult for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Not an easy hand to play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: 3@h is reasonable or perhaps even 3@c assuming it must be fit showing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|rhelle: vulnerable game, just bid it|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not dare to try 3@C but I like 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: I like 4@S as well|pg||
nt|april7: With this lead N should go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now declarer will emerge with 5|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus side of 2@C = vulnerabiltiy is scary, might go minus 1100, 5332 shape is poor, suit quality falls away (bad pips)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C response was transfer back to diamonds   showing a weak raise  presumable a 2 diamond immediate support would have been constructive|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjent: And the extra values means your 1100 is likely to be against ... a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: and even on the actual hand, North didn't pass South's Dbl, fearing that South might have a singleton club|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, how bad could it be? 180?|pg||
nt|petergill: North is very weak, so 380 is possible|pg||
nt|benjent: Even on the dud @sQ lead, 2@c gets carted|pg||
nt|benjent: Ahem. Please prepare for the sermon. If North didn't like his hand enough to keep on bidding it like an opening hand, then he shouldn't have started out with an opening bid|pg||
nt|petergill: South's attack on spades might be an attempt to put the opponents off from attacking spades themselves (on other layouts)|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben's point is very good|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S,2@H and 1 @C|pg||
nt|icechem: you did mention the hardness of the defence of 1NT earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, maybe not 5 any more|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|benjent: Caught a handy switch too, with the @s play|pg||
nt|petergill: so we give South credit for the good spade play - he knew clubs would not be continued|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk6: Seems a good idea to set up the side suit first, but it could have cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Trouble when South has the third heart and the doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: matter of individual preference, that North hand - 3/4@S, or a weak two (:))|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: However, Sævar could well throw a trick away soon|pg||
pc|d6|nt|skaftij: making now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By encouraging hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: South doesn't know that hearts are friendly, hence his long thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good."|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjent: How do EW play a 1NT overcall instead of 2@c? |pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|nt|petergill: East's reverse count @S6 (or eprhaps it was a Smith Echo?) perhaps guided South to this line of play|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there went another trick|pg||
nt|ady: should certainly have taken 5   playing a diamond might have given hin 6   but was not worth the risk to try and save 50 pts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|benjent: If strong, then South knows the @hQ is with East|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rhelle: well played|pg||
nt|petergill: Oops |pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: it is true that playing limited openers S can pass with a better hand than in standard. the question is whether he SHOULD, esp at these colors. most players who use these methods ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would bid with S hand, I think, to keep EW a bit more in the dark and delay their entry into the auction|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: Not such a good choice now|pg||

nt|snorris: a slam will be bid..'|pg||
nt|bg: N has type of hand my opps get at 5 cents a point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sævar will definitely not stop short of the grand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: true - but in their system, over a major that is almost impossible|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead best|pg||
nt|icechem: HF can make a game if they get there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: partner is not going to be carried away|pg||
nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|benjent: yeah, but if North comes down to @hKJ and @cJ10, then the last @s squeezes a little @h out of West and at the end he then knows for sure to drop the @hQ|pg||
nt|april7: probably 4NT - 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl of 1@S = Support Dbl, showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: stand not upon the order of thy going, but go at once |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: even 1NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  East's 6@S is not easy to explain|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For 500 bonus points no threading the needle.|pg||
nt|icechem: depends on lead and club play|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 4@S   lucky with K@H stiff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle: i.e. over 1@h, 1@s = relay, 1NT shows @s, 2@c = any invite, etc|pg||
nt|cicus: that puts it in different light|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's easier over 1@d, as 1@h and 1@s are 6-12 and F1R - offes much more scope for messing around|pg||
nt|ady: now almost certain to make|pg||
nt|icechem: well that lead didn't hurt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: in fact a heart lead could have held this to 7 tricks on perfect defence|pg||
nt|ady: it was    maybe one playing 14-30   the other 03-14|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Low club lead would be a killer from this side... but in the real world he has dodged a bullet |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tez: plus 1 now|pg||
nt|tez: still @d best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (Macbeth)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: My Aussie partnership plays exactly the same methods - let's see, we got the methods from Ishmael Delmonte, who got them from Andrew Robson in England I think, and the English and ...|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|april7: @S lead E need @H finesse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|april7: why @H lead after this bidding?|pg||
nt|icechem: HF are currently in 2nd place ahead of Málning|pg||
nt|icechem: but only 2VP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Fisk is now 5 VPs behind VÍS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will be more after this board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
nt|icechem: getting harder and harder for Fisk, running out of time to rally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume Fisk means the same as in the three Scandinavian languages|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: y|pg||
nt|ady: they got of to a very bad start playing 6@S down 1 and have never recovered|pg||
pc|hK|nt|benjent: horrible layout for declarer - and he knows it too|pg||
nt|petergill: As Ben pointed out, South will be displeased with himself for his slight misplay on the previous hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|Walddk6: Why do you want to make that hand declarer I wonder. Would 4@H not have been natural?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|april7: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: brb|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead awkward    can take heart finesse and ruff a heart   but cant get back to hand to ruff 2nd heart  and defence can play a 2nd spade|pg||
nt|april7: yes, so why @H lead?|pg||
nt|ady: north bid 2@H  so south led a heart    not abnormal|pg||
nt|april7: S had a chance to even the board|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|icechem: still has been a low scoring match, considering|pg||
mc|10|nt|benjent: hmmm ... I would have thought @dJ was clearly for a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Why did West bid 2@H instead of 1NT? I don't know. |pg||
nt|petergill: His lack of a @D stopper put him off|pg||
nt|benjent: That would be partner's job :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ was meant to be low - suit pref = don't play spades - but perhaps it was misinterpreted|pg||
nt|benjent: looks like it ... but without @dQ, @dJ is a loopy switch - surely he had some high pip he could have used instead|pg||
nt|petergill: If he can see all 52 cards, he plays @SA then a @D, but .....|pg||
nt|petergill: how can West tell that North doesn't not have another heart?|pg||
nt|benjent: Maybe @hQ now|pg||
nt|ady: will just lose a diamond    the heart loser would have gone away on the 3rd diamond anyway|pg||

nt|bg: anything but 4 dia will turn out wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: goes out for a beer, perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Potenetially short club, transfer response, limit 'raise'|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rhelle: a pushy 3rd hand 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: East did well to double.   Some might pass knowing they were facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: In most partnerships West's pass tends to 'show something'|pg||
nt|cicus: they were facing 2 passed hands :)|pg||
nt|joest: so that his 2@s bid now would not be a bust|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: After pass pass by de Wij = 4333 Rdbl = 4432 bid = 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: actually this FISK comes from a company name, Fi(skiðja) Sk(agafjarðar), I am told|pg||
nt|icechem: yes but also a wordplay|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in CR    club trick must have disappeared on hearts after club ducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are just waiting for an Icelander to invent the Eyjafjallajökull Club, the system that erupts!|pg||
nt|icechem: Fiskiðja Skagafjarðar is too hard name for foreigners. Fisk Seafood much easier :-)|pg||
nt|icechem: good idea Wald|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjent: yes, although that's what happened ... looks like it might have been a Smith Peter mishap|pg||
nt|cuttysark: other room opened a strong-club style 2@C and South became declarer after a 2@D enquiry|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes Gabor|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm not so sure|pg||
nt|ady: yes   good point Avram|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT the other way|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjent: So the @h lead is fine, but West will need to switch a @s rather than clear the @h's if South ducks a few|pg||
nt|bg: great auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I had one bid for my life, it would be to raise to 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More or less the same auction at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North bid 3@S instead of 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: needs to make 9 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not easy to find the diamond lead from the Wst hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But otherwise the same to this fine contract|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bid game and "Or it makes or it doesn't."|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Click on Afspil (Play)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|petergill: South played @H5 at Trick 1, so @H4 lead if 4th best must be KQ64|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: South might have taken a swing at 3NT.  They are probably not making overtricks and if they are down 2, double shows a big profit|pg||
nt|rhelle: South has seen North's 3rd hand openings before|pg||
nt|joest: but of 1NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: although the lead cost a trick it also helped to establish N's suit to which he has tehe required 2 entries|pg||
nt|rhelle: when he runs to 2D, Yes :)|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure whether south was initiating a runout.  the pass was alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Can't think of anything better to lead than a heart. Surely not a diamond|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|petergill: so South should have played @H2, less revealing, from his hand at Trick 1, not @H5|pg||
nt|april7: will make only 8 tricks|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: f E had a few hearts, 1D would be OK as it would let W show hearts (if 1H by W is natural). but on the actual hand it is time to start TELLING immediately|pg||

nt|skaftij: if North can show a bit better than minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 2NT usually has a better chance of making with 12 opposite 9 than 20 opposite 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The Icelandic World Champions in 1991 were: Guðmundur Páll Arnarson, Örn Arnþórsson, Jón Baldursson, Guðlaugur Jóhannsson, Þorlákur Jónsson and Aðalsteinn Jörgensen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk3: You have to play everything from your hand as it is here|pg||
nt|benjent: I agree with South's @s lead. Sure East has all the points, but that doesn't mean partner doesn't have any, and can't have a useful @s holding|pg||
nt|benjent: Sometimes that @hQ holds. Unlucky|pg||

mb|r|nt|ady: cards lay well for 3NT    diamonds well placed|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@H looks better|pg||
mb|p|an|penalty|nt|ady: e/w may get  more imps here if they play 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H would have worked after @D lead and even without|pg||
nt|april7: but 5@C went down in CR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: Then it's off to bed for us Aussie commentators (it's 11-15pm here), who will be replaced by Northern Hemisphere commentators for the next match|pg||
mb|d|an|penalty|nt|snorris: @h in the right hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: even making 4 diamond tricks is enough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Transfer to hearst this time: 1NT shows fewer than 3|pg||
nt|ady: doubling them in to the right spot|pg||
nt|icechem: things don't always go as one might expect :-)|pg||
mb|2D|an|nf|nt|ady: are the hearts going to emerge?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes.|pg||
nt|icechem: Jón really should bid 2h, must be a fit somewhere|pg||
nt|icechem: but scary when you have been doubled everywhere|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Fisk 2 VPs away from qualifying, so they need a big board soon|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Many thanks to Björgvin, our very competent operator is Reykjavík|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: 3NT is a cor blimey contract too|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H west?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Round-robin final tomorrow, matches of 16 boards. I believe the four teams carry their VP total forward. Björgvin?|pg||
mb|p|nt|icechem: hard for Þorlákur to bid 2H there if there was a long huddle|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Yes, all of it I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: yes they do all of it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk6: So GT is in a very strong position|pg||
nt|icechem: all the doubling enabled EW to play a comfortable spot|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 35 VPs ahead of 2nd!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Felt had bid out the hand?  I'm really surprised, seems was pushed around.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: A rush of blood by both EW's|pg||
nt|benjent: I think Magnus was thinking about unblocking the @sQ there - give himself the best chance of forcibly setting up the @s suit|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Our Aussie commentators may be able to analyse bridge hands, but they can't pronounce the name of that (now) famous vulcano. Many have tried and it's hilarious every time you hear ...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: it on radio or TV|pg||
nt|petergill: Lead is good for NS. 3NT is not down yet ...|pg||
nt|benjent: I nearly got trapped in Hong Kong of all places.|pg||
nt|benjent: Various planes got stuck in Europe, so random flights in Asia got cancelled. Not mine, thank you|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: next session 1 hour 40 minutes|pg||

pc|d7|nt|benjent: @h switch gave away a @h trick, but NS should still be able to manage the beat|pg||
pc|d4|nt|icechem: as the idiom says, when bidding screams for trump, don't look at your trump holding|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Even our Aussie flights (e.g. to Singapore) have been cancelled, because Singapore was clogged with European-bound planes. |pg||

mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|dburn: North-South never bid hearts at the other table, which seems a bit odd|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|dburn: but South started with a modern overcall and not an old-fashioned double, and the auction took a weird turn|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with overcall|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, on this layour game is not cold|pg||
nt|peachy: North's distribution is good enough to bid over 2D (the other table)|pg||
nt|dburn: although West had better not double it - that will help declarer a lot with the play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: perhaps extra diam length in E will persuade declarer to get trumps right|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Iceland won the World Championship (Bermuda Bowl) in 1991, and has been a strong force at bridge every since then|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
nt|ady: part sxore hand to begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you double or 1NT?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: Want to be at the top to bid 1NT with a single stopper.|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Player names are all first names as you may have guessed. Surnames are not used much in Iceland. You can see them in the profiles, though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: And a clear pass for Hrannar now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that 2@C and 2@D are natural|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  if playing Smolen, it will be easy to reach|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good thing you don't play Gazzilli with exactly this hand type|pg||
nt|Walddk6: ð (special d), Þ (th) and þ (th in the middle of a word) are unique Icelandic characters. You see that special Th in Þorlákur|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: 2@C must have shown hearts, perhaps showing hearts and another suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  and it appears they are|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|bg: lots of potential tricks NS will not be able to establish hearts if if W misguesses|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland. However, you can see them in the player profiles|pg||
nt|Walddk6: After round 11, top four advance to a round-robin final |pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: starts with a bang|pg||
nt|Walddk6: They carry their VP score forward|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: 3@S  5 hearts and 4 spades forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then the earliest stop would be 3@D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzhn: 2@C is @H and @C|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice pressure bid by Magnús|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately on a @H lead 2 down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: If declarer can set up the @c's, with an entry left to dummy, he can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous even with 7 card suit should go down 2   an agressive east might have got 500|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/results/  for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: east holding of 3 low hearts not great   but has chosen the right spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ax of @d makes 3N unattractive|pg||
nt|ady: might well make6 on tghis lead|pg||
nt|ady: this|pg||
nt|ady: good lead if west plays the 9|pg||
nt|april7: for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/results/  for running scores and standings|pg||
nt|april7: 3/5 lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: entries no problem now.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could be from K872|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a loud bang - that was not the obvious move by West, who could have tried 4NT if he wanted to bid at all|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Two very good pairs at this table, high quality bridge to be expected|pg||
nt|ady: preference for double with 4 hearts  and just 1 spade stopper|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Declarer has only 2 losers but has only 8 tricks, unless he sets up the long clubs in time|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Magnús did well to insert the 9|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sævar is a dream partner I can tell you. He used to live in Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But this will hurt|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Around 1400-1700 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk6: David?|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to add them up - not sure I can count that far|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: if east decides to play a heart to the ace can go down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|ady: King I mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be anti percentage|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjent: North had made the right lead, obvious though it was ... but he needed to shorten dummy's trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: but in principle, I can see only four tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: and that's down seven, and that's minus 1700|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I usually only go for 1700 when vulnerable, so this is quite an achievement|pg||
nt|dburn: still, some sympathy for West - his opponents bid the major suits,so he hoped he would find partner with more than three cards in the minors|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: @CQ = costfree falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I played a lot with him. Nice guy, fine player|pg||

pc|d9|nt|dburn: even so, 5@c likely to work only if partner had as many as four clubs, and that perhaps was asking a bit much|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Frimann|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Declarer lacks entries to dummy to both set up and make tricks with the long clubs|pg||
nt|benjent: I doubt West will believe it - that @dK sure looked like shortage, and how many shortages can one balanced hand have?|pg||
nt|benjent: Sure he does - just overtake the @hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: but will make 10 tricks on the crossruff|pg||
nt|petergill: crossruff guarantees 10 tricks ... overtakeing @HQ is dangerous if hearts are 4-1|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Grant Thornton are the current champions|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|icechem: Quite a big match we have this time|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Are you familiar with the Ice Relays if we get to see them?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yup, these are the two leading contenders for the third and final spot.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: possible for West to have held long spades and out - declarer did not want to pass @hQ to the king, and have West overruff the third club with @hJ|pg||

nt|dburn: close decision, though - not at all clear what was right in theory, but declarer certainly wrong in practice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, all true, but i think EW play forcing club so max for a 1D opener plus empty spaces may suggest heart K with W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if this is enough for S to bid 2N on after 2D, maybe N should correct 2N to 3D. if S has any sort of hand, he can still bid 3N |pg||

nt|ady: some open on the north hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/results/  for running scores and standings|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW precision, so loose 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Often the case that the defence does not get what they are entitled to when the opponents are in a ridiculous contract|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Specs asking. What is Verðbréf?|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  some Ghestem?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Note that surnames are not used much in Iceland, but you see them in player profiles|pg||

nt|snorris: Sævar Ragnar and Karl have all lived in Copenhagen|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that was quite a let-off - but it is sometimes hard for the defenders to realise just how bad declarer's contract is|pg||
nt|Walddk6: As David said, it was 1700 at some point, without too much sweat|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is 10-13|pg||

pc|c7|nt|benjent: I'm not enthusiastic about North's X of 2@c. Gives away information for an unlikely gain|pg||
nt|petergill: EW seem to be heading towards the cold 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Player names are all first names as I'm sure you have guessed. Surnames are not used much in Iceland. You can see them in the profiles, though|pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand not many losers - if there is a fit.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|benjent: South's X of 2@d I understand ... get partner off what looks likely to be a dud @c lead, point the way and all that|pg||

nt|ady: now no need to ruff a heart in dummy|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: against a loose 1@D opener, it is not "clear" that 2@D is a cue-bid, but it is easier to define it as such |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will be hard to defend effectively|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: as otherwise you are left without one |pg||
nt|bg: 3d a frisky try opp passed hand will come up a trick short|pg||
nt|dburn: courageous by North, this|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 2@CXX would have been a huge score for EW, as the cards lie - but South would run to 2@D to save the day|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk6: Icemen are fearless as Liz said the other day|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I believe he is an Icelander - there are no cowardly Icemen|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe West could have supported diamonds, even though he doesn't have all that much|pg||
nt|dburn: if North still bid 3NT, East might have led more effectively|pg||
nt|Walddk6: It's no coincidence that you rarely see part scores in MOVIE|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, declarer has a chance now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: You put your cursor on the bids to see what the bids mean|pg||
nt|benjent: Gazzilli is one of those methods where everyone starts the same and then rapidly diverges|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|benjent: Luckily North got his X in, or South would have had no idea what to lead :)|pg||
nt|april7: must fines in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Can then play 2@S when you want to.|pg||
nt|icechem: yes, HF Verdbref is a company that trades in stocks and bonds|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos:  eight evver nine never hey|pg||
nt|Walddk6: They bid games, slams or pass them out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  in 2, declarer will have few problems|pg||
nt|ady: will lose 1 spade 2 clubs and either 1 or 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But only because spades are 4-0|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Often on the same board :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Indeed. That happened yesterday|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if West had bid North would probably not have gone on to game, and gone plus against 3@d instead|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Passout at one table, 6@C-1 at the other|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Sævar and Karl were defending 3NT X yesterday, Sævar lead something and moments later down 8 for 2000|pg||
