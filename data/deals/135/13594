nt|brolucius: Let the show begin.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Us players tend to make their weak-twos stronger than elsewhere and might open 2@H on the East cards. 1@H is the normal opening bid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East's three tens entitle him to upgrade the hand from 14 to 15 points.|pg||

nt|athene: Hello good afternoon everyone.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Bill and Roland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the queen holds at Trick 1, he will have nine top tricks and must calculate how best to play the red suits for 2 more.|pg||
nt|athene: Just thinking about the spade suit you would like to play low here (south may have @SJ10 for one thing) but there are other issues|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|athene: if you play low, relying on making the queen later, that gives the defence another trick |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: and they are getting to five before you can laboriously build all your necessary winners|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Wow, we have 1100 kibitzers mid-week. I wonder if that can be ANYTHING to do with the fact that Garozzo is playing.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: however, these hands are notoriously difficult to defend so even if playing low is wrong in theory, declarer may survive|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: there we are - the expected misdefence|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|athene: if south had returned a diamond the defence could come to one spade, one heart and three diamonds i think?|pg||

mc|9|nt|brolucius: South must have been hoping that the @SJ would pin the @S8 in the East hand, but did that fit with the second spade that North played (the @S2)?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Congrats to Magnús on winning the Icelandic Teams Championships last week. Splendid performance, well done!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In any case he had the option of playing king and another spade to dummy's bare @SQ, which would have beaten the contract.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Sometimes simplest is best, that was such an occasion.|pg||
nt|iceking: Tough hand for Anreoli Garozzos spade 9 in trick 1 was really confusing |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Gunev's 4@D (rather than 3@S) is a bit puzzling, at the other table.|pg||
nt|athene: South has a borderline decision after 1@D - 1@S whether to rebid 2@D or 2@S, but the 2@H overcall somewhat solves his problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Double for take-out, of course, the normal way of keep the auction moving.|pg||
nt|athene: Clearly NS share David Burn's view on support doubles|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those who play support double could trot it out.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: they might play support dbl even S passed this time|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps they play the French style where double shows 3-card support and a non-minimum|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure S would have bid 2sp here direct if they do not play support dbls|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer cannot enjoy the long diamonds, for a club discard, if he has to ruff a heart.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcwla: A style that shows 3-card support and not a _balanced_ minimum is one thing; but this is a hand that might have made a single raise; hence if playing support X I feel should make ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: it here.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the standard way to kill a long suit in dummy is to force dummy to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so that declarer can't draw trumps ending in dummy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Odd-even signals for E-W it appears. Odd card is encouraging, even card discouraging; hence @C8 from Primavera|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|mc|11|nt|jcwla: Imagine, wanting to tell your whole story in one card!|pg||
nt|jcwla: "But I always have all odds or all evens" -- yeah, right.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better for East to ruff and play a top heart.|pg||
pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||

mb|1C|nt|jcwla: -300 usually not a winner on 20/20's|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You speak from experience, Jordan?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|iceking: NS make 4h here might end there as hands are both rather pure|pg||
nt|iceking: down one diamon lead though so not so true:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: the defence can set up two diamonds before declarer can organise a diamond pitch on the fourth spade, i think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|iceking: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting double from south - 1@H looks the normal action|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@H. That's a surprise.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|iceking: little odd with 14hcp only to dbl with this pattern|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: club lead and the @DQ switch means 140 fairly quickly i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course 4@H is an awful contract. It just happens that the cards lie perfectly.|pg||
nt|iceking: should be 4 imps to Garozzo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might have seen @C competition.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C5  3rd/5th  if he leads one|pg||
nt|iceking: Garozzo will lead trump or|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: aha, 4th it is|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|iceking: 170 or 140 same 4imps |pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: OK, declarer gives the tempo back|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair, he doesn't know the spades and diamonds lie quite so nicely, so he is just trying to make 8 tricks, rather than 10|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT must show some kind of spade raise. He has such a minimum, it is surprising that they cannot play in 2@S. |pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|iceking: north has a min opening wonder why he cant just raise 1sp to 2sp|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: A very good question, to which we will probably never know the answer.|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told a trump lead beats 2@S, but that's hard to find from Q10x|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps not impossible|pg||
nt|athene: as the saying goes, "if the auction calls for a trump lead, don't look at your trump holding, just lead a trump"|pg||
nt|iceking: told 1sp here is 0-4 spades so i assume 1nt would promice 5+ spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes a Kaplan Inversion auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: How can they be thinking of going higher on those values?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: From the sound of the bidding, I would pull out a Reverse card from a Uno deck and reverse the bidding to 1@S.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Getting to 3@S with 18 points between you and only a 4-4 fit is not so wonderful. It is not as if East-West could have made much.|pg||

nt|iceking: that might do it w little stuck now |pg||
nt|athene: now he has to pin the @H9?|pg||
nt|iceking: w cant discard heart anymore |pg||
nt|athene: west can pitch it of course but then even if overruffs, he has to give dummy the lead in clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: heart q from dummy was great play|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|h9|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is beginning to look as if 1NT was forcing to game. |pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: "give up now - we have NO weak spot in 3nt!"|pg||
