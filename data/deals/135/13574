nt|soban: While Denny (Sacul - Franky Karwur, Donny Tuerah memed Hendrawan) play for Syabas Energy fail go to semi final.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weak NT came at 3rd hand again for NS. |pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now a very tolerable penalty. D lead best|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||

nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ferlema: el declarante debe tratar de hacer dos bazas de espadas, una de corazon, tres de diamante y cuatro de trebol|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|ferlema: pequeño error de Norte que debio desbloquear el palo de trebol sirviendo el J|pg||
nt|ferlema: conservqndo una entrada adicional al muerto conservando el @C 10 como entrada|pg||
nt|ferlema: en este caso va a pasar desapercibido|pg||

nt|rodal f: Any to come from EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||

nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1NT=2/1 it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: even more so after this X|pg||
mb|3C|nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ferlema: no|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trèbol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|josj: still possible to make as N should hold 4 @S and thus 5-4-2-2|pg||

nt|rodal f: I understand S by the bid. Hard to see the nice fit.|pg||
nt|josj: good they did...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: he was taking an advanced save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H often a easy raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing for EW|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would 2NT be ower the 2@H?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  by S?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  and EW did bid the slam on board 5|pg||
nt|josj: if NS miss another game, they will lose the lead temporarily|pg||
nt|josj: better not to open W hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: kind of astonishing N bid only 3S over the transfer. |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: nor the E hand btw :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will not like this|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't agree by the biddings at non of them.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N alerted multi and E to be killed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: sin ser exitista, muy bien Sur y Oeste|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: X=3c suppost I presume|pg||
nt|josj: the intervention was slightly mistimed but how could E know?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt even have a double of FIVE spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: support*|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||
nt|josj: well, had the @C been able to run, 3NT would have been a fine shot|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done South|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|josj: 6@D would have been excellent at about 90% but neither team attempted it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  now duck @s twice|pg||
nt|andyv:  once|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|ferlema: 3 multas|pg||
nt|andyv:  should take this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times some could have been taken. Onse from NS and twice from EW. It cost a bit by miss the alert.|pg||
nt|josj: but not if you throw dummy's @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: I am still wondering about the scoring of  9|pg||
