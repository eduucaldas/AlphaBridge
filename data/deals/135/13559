mb|p|mb|1C|nt|woozle: 4S looks best, 3NT looks most likely|pg||
mb|3C|nt|westjava: no one:)|pg||
nt|woozle: Rogi takes advantage of the vulnerability to consume some space|pg||

nt|blewah: hi guys|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Arya!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Arya. And welcome:).|pg||
nt|woozle: Manoppo doubles...I guess it's 5-8 or something but I can't see how it will work out well|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|westjava: 5-7, Kieran|pg||
nt|blewah: hard to stop short of gamne now|pg||
nt|rodal f: At prec I just often wander.|pg||
nt|woozle: Given that it's near-certain that he'll have to follow up by bidding 4D, it's hard to see how it will ever lead to a plus|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Old natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or realys.|pg||
nt|woozle: I always wondered how the name "precision" slipped past the regulators...in competition, it usually looks like "guesswork"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: NS fall on their feet, in a game which has a play|pg||
nt|westjava: any way, you were right Kieran, 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: nice bid. now all he has to do is make it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|woozle: probably no point in ruffing all the hearts...declarer looks better placed if he concedes a trick to the heart king|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: For pairs who have press well worked it ain't, but seems so here.|pg||
nt|woozle: then one heart ruff and draw trumps|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: setup @H may better|pg||
nt|woozle: Wohon would have done best to duck there...then when Rogi wins the heart king, two more spades leaves the contract without play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: From here, setting up the hearts won't work if North gets tapped, but he might be able to enjoy two hearts, two diamonds, one club, and five tricks on a crossruff|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|woozle: cold without a trump exit here|pg||
nt|woozle: Wohon signalled count in hearts, but the ten might have been better if it expressed the slow heart trick|pg||
nt|westjava: declarer will go home now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|woozle: trump exit would have made it hard|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will he?|pg||
nt|blewah: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: now ruff, diamond king, heart ace, heart jack, high crossruff|pg||
nt|blewah: but it was hard for Rogi to find  trump return|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: Or he can ruff a heart low and play East for 3316, drawing trumps|pg||
nt|westjava: and under ruff by Wohon...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Was that @H from W. Or?|pg||

nt|westjava: Lasut (68) going older...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|blewah: what is 2@d?|pg||
nt|woozle: Manoppo tries a light 1D in third seat, and Wohon makes a 2D overcall that I can't figure out|pg||
nt|woozle: top and bottom? 4 spades and longer clubs?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|westjava: seems like Michael:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Sr. U was right. Any lead to make N go gown?|pg||
nt|woozle: no, just an operator typo...Wohon was actually making a normal sound 2C overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: all clear now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Rogi starts with a good raise and follows with a very wet 3C|pg||
nt|woozle: surely the hand ought to at some point suggest NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|woozle: Today, 5C is cold (on the spade finesse and no heart ruff...not a great spot) and 3NT makes or goes down a bunch depending on the lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: but it doesn't really look like Rogi is giving proper respect to vulnerable overcalls or vulnerable game bonuses|pg||

mc|11|nt|woozle: I don't mind 2D, but for me this East hand is worth a game force opposite a vulnerable 2-level overcall|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|woozle: Rogi starts with 1NT, presumably weak|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|woozle: This East hand is what I call a hand of biblical proportions - three kings from the east|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Manoppo's pass over 1NT looks like a surefire recipe for missing a major suit game|pg||
nt|blewah: :) and what does it suggest, Kieran?|pg||
nt|woozle: And Lasut's 3D overcall looks positively manic - apparently the correct approach to his overcalls over weak notrump auctions is to never bid a game, ever|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D would never have been done at vul.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Is it wourth at any way? I don't like that bit.bid*|pg||

nt|rodal f: They are youngsters as me a my silly brain. So the should have a bit better control.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ain't tis slam less than 50%?|pg||
nt|blewah: a lot less, Rodal|pg||
