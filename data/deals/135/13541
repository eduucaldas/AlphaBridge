nt|beauch:  west was clearly trying to show stronger and longer@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 100 v 620 for 4@S good sac|pg||
pc|sA|nt|beauch:  if ns pump declarer with spades - could get messy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mr murray: very good. should be duplicated in other room although I can see North pushing to 5 level cause he knows it is a great save and feels it is important to score 650.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|frankaus: the scores we se are only indicative - the results are based on imps V a datum of the mean of all scores excluding the extreme values|pg||

nt|andyv:  W had looks like the saving type|pg||

nt|olson: not clear when partner has  6h  for multi  |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this one esp. weak|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: 1 @S really from E?|pg||
nt|olson: if  NS reach  4s  W may defend since they have 3 suits  sewn up  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I know the down under's are fun,  but that is too much fun for me |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal and welcome also David Hoffman|pg||
nt|olson: he may expect  E  to actually have something for the  2d! bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should just bid 4@s (if they can play that)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and nice to have Catherine on vugraph :)|pg||
nt|hoffers: This match will not be fast, as all are thoughtful before making bids and plays|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope...xfers|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|olson: w  will be  unhappy when he sees dummy and realizes  E  bid  on  2632 with  2 jacks|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will not be happy with his actions... he really should bid 4N over 4@s to give pd a choice of minors|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: 3 @S   is the bigger bid than 4 |pg||
pc|cK|nt|hoffers: In Australia, the ANC (Aust National Chams) is the only event where players represent their state|pg||
nt|hoffers: The top three in this event will represent NSW (the current holders)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there's a faint chance of making this, losing @H @D @C|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|rodal f: May we see a quick 7 tricker?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|olson: maybe  west  should trust  vul opps  and guess that partner  was  having some fun at favorable colors|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be a sizeable pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe a 4 loser hand with favorable vul should just not chance it when opps are likely to have a 10 or 11 card fit|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Lavings could still bid 3N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Suit surprised me. Minor nt use to be normaly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: north could have had  QJ10  and  allowed  declarer to make now with 1 H  loser ,  w always had a diamond for an exit card|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|olson: w should know his partner was  2632  so he could always win the H king if allowed to and exit a diamond|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: it*|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR only got to 2@h... NS must play intermediate NT (11-14 or so).|pg||

nt|andyv:  he can let go clubs|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  but didn't |pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  A renege is the failure to follow suit. A revoke occurs when there has been a renege and it is not caught before the reneger's side plays to the next trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6 seems like a lot |pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems*|pg||
nt|olson: once partner  bids  3c   3n should have play  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  the @h slam basically depends on a @h honor onside and no spade ruff|pg||
nt|olson: east could have run from 1n X   it is rarely the correct spot for declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: But ain't unnormal seen from S side|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a doddle may even make 4@H as Lavings just follows suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  the spade slam might get very messy to play, although not on this layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: clubs  are blocked|pg||

nt|andyv:  hard to keep 21 point hands down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  true, you would always bid 3N over pd's bid of 3@c... you just don't know what you are getting:)|pg||

nt|ritong: if i were wu, i would "check" as frank suggested earlier|pg||

nt|ritong: however, the auction sounds a lot like 5@cs with north|pg||
nt|woozle: Not as bad as a spade lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think it occured at the one where they thought for 10 minutes then I forgot whose lead it was, missing the rest of the lay. The confusion was exacerbated by Lazer (who I can see) ...|pg||
