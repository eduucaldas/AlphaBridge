mb|p|nt|jtr: Distributional take out double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 3@s is a bit rich opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very Italian|pg||
nt|jtr: And 3@s is a bit exhuberant facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Touche Jeffrey|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: perhaps West felt his partner might actually have something |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||

nt|vugraphzxx: TGR's running scores round 8, halftime: de Botton vs Dhondy 53-13 ; Scerri vs LNWers 51-13; OMC vs TGRs 9-13 ;Teltscher vs Cardtossers 47-14|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it would be nicer to have all teams playing the same boards, though|pg||
nt|jtr: Makes for more interest in the bar afterwards too|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I assume all balanced hands are opened 1@C by the N-S pair in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: yes, it's a shame South opened a non-systemic 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, is it|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Pros and cons. The advantage of opening 1@C on 2+ is that 1@D is 5+ unless 4441|pg||

nt|lestergold: you have to stay low and oujt of game!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't get surprised 3n by Frances, sorta touch and go|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be easier for more natural bidders, opening 1 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: not after heart bids and two doubles by Gold|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so what 3@h shows?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it doesnt show it asks surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@h asks for a @H lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a joke|pg||
nt|lestergold: poor Hinden she is seriously fixed!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@h asks for a @h stop for 3NT and the X asks for a @h lead|pg||

nt|odysseus69: when opponents start with a strong club it is a signal to the oppo to get busy- Ewart responded accordingly with 2S in the open room|pg||
