mb|p|nt|josj: selamat malam Batam & sekitarnya :)|pg||

nt|josj: selamat siang Indonesia and hello to all of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Re hi all nice spec and co commentators:)|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam and rehi all for the closing segment of the final|pg||
nt|josj: 10 more boards to go to decide a winner|pg||
nt|josj: though there i something strange in the Kalimantan team: at this table, a strong pair from Manado (North Celebes) is playing for them... |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: selamat siang untuk Indonesia and hello to all other spectators|pg||
nt|josj: is|pg||
nt|josj: welcome to the quarterfinals of the Inter Province Champ's.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|rodal f: Not 4@D from W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice cards for NS but a bad layout in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: rehi Rødal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|josj: sry: I mean East Java, of course, I was talking about Rogi-Wohon|pg||
nt|josj: they are Manadonese|pg||
nt|josj: the format is 2 segments of 16 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often u like to play 4 in major here afterthe opening and the 3@D.|pg||
nt|josj: the 4 winners proceed to the semis (seems logical)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: 4@S is not down yet...trumplead is best :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@Dminisplinter and @S it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: here we have another match of the Inter-Provinces qualifications|pg||
nt|josj: selamat sore untuk Indonesia and hello again to all other spectators|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: aparentemente dos multas|pg||
nt|josj: I hope South bid 1@S over 1@C and not East|pg||
nt|josj: Venue is Batam, Riau Archipelago, just off the coast of Singapore|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Liked west by the try. Non vul|pg||
nt|josj: it's good for your geographical knowledge of the country :)|pg||
nt|josj: but anyway, NS started off by missing a reasonably cold slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so NS escaped the axe here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ferlema: una baza de triunfo @D A y K y @C A y K|pg||
nt|josj: 6NT needs @D 5-0 to go down|pg||
nt|josj: a big swing on the last board played in the OR gave Jakarta a quite healthy lead of 33 with just the 16 boards of this segment to play|pg||
nt|josj: rehi all and selamat sore Indonesia :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: 6@S is worse but still well over 50% so a good second choice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: selamat sore and good morning/evening etc. to all of you|pg||
nt|josj: this lead will certainly do declarer no harm|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took the full speed?|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the team from South Celebes (Makassar) is facing South Sumatra (Palembang)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: extra tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|josj: Tobing-Asbi, the EW pair, have often played for the national team|pg||

nt|baldjean: it looks as if the match stfarts excitingly|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: hi all :) welcome|pg||
nt|josj: it's going to be quite an uphill task for the Semarang team to catch up the Metropolitans|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|baldjean: will be a quick claim|pg||
nt|josj: well, we have to be stuck as there is little to think about in playing this contract :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: The safe line against 05 is?|pg||
nt|josj: @CAK now and then declarer knows trumps atr 5-0|pg||
nt|josj: are|pg||
nt|josj: not touching trumps at all|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|josj: the NS pair is from Semarang, Central Java's capital and also a center of bridge in the country|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: I think this is a Round 7 match between the West Java and North Sumatra teams so it's Bandung v. Medan|pg||

nt|josj: Jakarta is "hors concours," of course, with well over 15 million people around|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: and a good start for Gabrial UI, the Bridge Club of the Universitas Indonesia at Depok|pg||

nt|josj: selamat siang Batam and good moring/evening to all other kibz|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Jos, Roland and specs|pg||
nt|rodal f: for      for    * GRR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u feel that WE was a bit lucky here Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: playing Geologi Timah, fro Bandung's Geological Institute|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well I asked for the best line.|pg||
nt|josj: lead a @C raher than a @H from dummy to find out the exact layout|pg||
nt|josj: so a very lucky escape there with 4@S easily made|pg||
nt|westjava: This is Indonesia 48th Championships 2010, Inter Province Round-10|pg||
nt|westjava: 24 Provinces devided in Pool A and Pool B|pg||
nt|josj: after the @D lead you have to finesse in spades before you discard your losing @D on the hearts, using the @H entries to repeat the @S finesse|pg||
nt|josj: non vul. it's not obvious to reach game|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to see where that 7th trick had to come from|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|josj: not really|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was. Dont play thrumh. Asu said Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: with @CQJ10 and the three-card @S in E, there should have been an automatic squeeze for 13 tricks but declarer did not bother (nor did I).|pg||
nt|josj: and here we have another beautiful misfit|pg||
nt|josj: pinpointed by East's Multi :)|pg||

nt|josj: EW play 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzhh: ...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@S would not have been my cup of tea but it effectievly takes away 3HT as a landing spot for W|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: with both rounded finesses working, 5@D makes even if played by East so the save would have been correct had it not gone down too much (-5, maybe...)|pg||
nt|josj: but we will see...|pg||
nt|josj: in spite of the trump lead, this should make easily|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: Gabrial is one of the teams representing UI: Universitas Indonesia|pg||
nt|josj: this is in Depok, 40 km S of Jakarta |pg||
nt|rodal f: No comment here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2 and 3 @D my fealing was 4@D from W but he did right by the X.|pg||
nt|rodal f: feeling*|pg||
nt|josj: and S did well not to balance...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baldjean: apparently they do|pg||
nt|josj: Tommy Rogi did the right thing, anyway...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: MGTH means"may good things happen"|pg||
nt|josj: and it's one of the cheapest spots to go for NS as well...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: but it always remains to be seen for which side :)|pg||
nt|josj: and a more quiet deal here but 7 tricks are far away for EW, I think|pg||
nt|josj: and so does Octa...|pg||
nt|josj: so we might need a calculator here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ferlema: este torneo sirve de preparacion para el proximo campeonato sudamericano,,, toda la info click aqui: http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010.htm|pg||
nt|josj: is a grand a good proposition here?|pg||
nt|josj: again trump lead is best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baldjean: the way cards lie even 4 woujld make though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|josj: and this time,the leader has a few of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot I like. Could have been better at an other contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but the contract not really in danger anyway|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C, 3@H and exit in @D|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C que by @D|pg||
nt|josj: hi Adi :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  S thankful he has 9 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|westjava: battle of rank 4 vs 5 on this table|pg||

pc|cT|nt|rodal f: NO?|pg||
nt|westjava: 4 top rank each pool go to Quarterfinal|pg||
nt|josj: overtricks non vul. are much cheaper than doubled undertricks vul.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: this saves an undertrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|soban: from other semi final GEOLOGI TIMAH leading 30 imps againt BHINEKA (Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Jemmy Bojoh, Leslie Gontha)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why could not N pass for a check at @S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Keng by a good one there|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|josj: this is teams so np |pg||
nt|rodal f: If u don't cover a honor u don't have (the@SQ)|pg||
nt|josj: now he can always ruff a club and throw one on @DK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||
nt|westjava: the famous pair from Sulawesi Utara (North Sulawesi), Henky Lasut-Eddy Manoppo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|josj: there go the @H tricks for the def.|pg||
nt|josj: -4 I can calculate by heart :)|pg||
nt|josj: an effective line, I have to admit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ferlema: con la linea que esta jugando Esteban hay 10 bazas|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks even|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? How could Tobing find that??|pg||
nt|josj: throw the last club and play trumps...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|josj: we saw something like that in the Premier League as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|westjava: both World International Master|pg||
pc|h8|nt|josj: not very interesting at imps though ...in short matches, every imp might count|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: A auto small?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ment the Q@S, but some other chances was there so ok.|pg||
nt|josj: trying to play safe|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|soban: right Josj.|pg||
nt|josj: if either red suit breaks 3-2, there are 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good contract|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||

nt|josj: Maybe, South's double was a little aggressive, vul.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|baldjean: 3nt is my prediction|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|josj: selamat sore Indonesia and (re) hi to all of you|pg||
nt|westjava: may EW reach to 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW can escape for a tolerable penalty against 3N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ferlema: al margen que Norte y Sur tomaron la buena desicion de jugar en el 4/4|pg||
nt|soban: While Denny (Sacul - Franky Karwur, Donny Tuerah memed Hendrawan) play for Syabas Energy fail go to semi final.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weak NT came at 3rd hand again for NS. |pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now a very tolerable penalty. D lead best|pg||
nt|josj: easy going for EW to the right contract|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,stolen by 3@C!|pg||
nt|josj: 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|josj: both sides nearly make game...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: this is a Round 8 match in the qualifications. They are about halfway through it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's 2nd dbl probably influenced by the vul|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
nt|josj: on a  @S lead this might be problematic|pg||

pc|d7|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: I waited a @H support Jos and u have the minor support.|pg||
nt|josj: forcing NT and best minor rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N has a hand that should be opened|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|josj: W might have tried 5@C over 4@D|pg||

nt|rodal f: Else 2NT never would have comed.|pg||
nt|josj: well, sooner or later the finesse of the @H9 would have been necessary had it not come down in the second round of the suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|westjava: sry all,no info from operator for previous board|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|josj: now he has to take all @S finesses which he will duly do, I assume|pg||

nt|rodal f: I am to slow specs. A bit sorry for that.|pg||
nt|josj: play is slow, maybe?|pg||

nt|westjava: good morning,afternoon and evening!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|josj: nice misfit in EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @D as save?|pg||
nt|westjava: maybe crowded over there...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: P - P - 1@C, agree west|pg||
nt|josj: he might have had more problems had N cashed both top trumps and put S in with @HK to lead a 3rd trump before the @SA is out of the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: our other match is Geology Timah vs Bhineka|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was a costful one.|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|baldjean: this wil be a standard 4@s for E/W|pg||
nt|april7: strength|pg||
nt|josj: I am told it's 20 boards only so dinner break is tight now and we will con tinue at 19.00 hrs WIB, in just over 2 hrs (13.00 GMT)|pg||
nt|josj: N can just avoid being squeezed out of his pointed stopppers, I think|pg||
nt|josj: Strothis ng Club|pg||
nt|josj: strong club this time|pg||
nt|josj: anyway, so fat the match seems rather quiet|pg||
nt|josj: far|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  5 of minor seems to be the best spot for NS|pg||
nt|josj: this too looks like a routine 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: dinner right now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a bit fun to look at NS cards in the beginning. BUT....|pg||
nt|josj: interesting hand: on the "obvious" @SK lead you make 7@H|pg||
nt|josj: partscore battle, to be won by NS perforce|pg||
nt|josj: if N introduces his suit at any time|pg||
nt|josj: N will find a disappointing dummy and so will West|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||
nt|josj: but it needs a @D ruff in  front of dummy to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  probably 2@s here|pg||
nt|andyv:  followed by @d raise|pg||
nt|josj: and 5@D is the wrong spot to be|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N whould bid 4NT to suggest a twosuiter;|pg||
nt|josj: if he gets 5@C, 5@D willl the show the reds|pg||
nt|josj: 5@D looks reasonable enough but might prove difficult on a @C force defence |pg||
nt|josj: strong club  by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: assuming 1@D is Precisio, here we have the disadvante of it|pg||
nt|josj: tage|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|april7: most probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it - 3@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||
nt|josj: which may lead to 3NT..|pg||
nt|josj: N prefers to stay passive and will thus pay -110|pg||
nt|josj: 1NT rebid 15-17 of course |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
nt|josj: or even -140|pg||
nt|josj: now|pg||
nt|josj: though this E hand is one of the uglier strong NT hands...|pg||
nt|josj: W is well advosed to pass a.s.a.p.|pg||
nt|josj: advised|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Strong Club but 2@S then was an overbid, taking the 1@D into account|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: now the clubs seem blocked :)|pg||
nt|josj: no double, no trouble...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i get some info about board no 4, NTB get a pinalty|pg||
nt|josj: one more chance for EW here to collect a swing by just doing nothing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N doesn't bid NT, South probably should be weary of it.|pg||
nt|josj: yes but will he?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: How do EW pan a weak NT? I needed.|pg||
nt|josj: in 4@H there is work to do for +620 whereas 3@D is an easy 800...|pg||
nt|josj: 500 sry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: the hands fit well, no club wastage|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C rebid by S is 9 minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes I wonder what the purpose of finding a fit is|pg||
nt|josj: not enough tricks in a @H slam|pg||
nt|josj: but not quite...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has nothing to say here|pg||
nt|josj: advanced daisy-picking?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: very good lead by Fauzi...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C was MSA, I think and 3@H showed @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|josj: S trying to find out about the remote chance of a @D slam|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  wow... I guess he does|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might some fun to come anyway. N don't like his @C and press S.|pg||
nt|rodal f: That wrong I was:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT is a lucky make with @C blocked and @DQ coming down|pg||
nt|westjava: some revoke,you mean?|pg||
nt|josj: I can see 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  or they have some other type of understandings about this sequence|pg||
nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N realised there was no room fo too many S cards in S hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Adi may have noticed the previous NT (board 4) and decided not to take a chance:)|pg||
nt|josj: -2...next|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzhu: closing |pg||
nt|rodal f: Isit that lucky by %?|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe still 800...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: in % it should be called very lucky|pg||
nt|rodal f: Com si com sa. But I agree it u. Ure end by bidding would have been?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
nt|josj: on the @SK lead, 5@D is through|pg||
nt|josj: if def. play @S after cashing their @D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|april7: the J of @H makes the game if opponents lead trumps in 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, game makes here, but it does not seem a major crime to miss it |pg||
nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||
nt|april7: but I think the vulnerability makes it worthwile|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the West hand is hard to evaluate - 5332 shape, three small clubs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ferlema: 11 bazas, next|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: agree with u* sorry again.|pg||
nt|josj: maybe 4@S?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  Murphi had no problem there|pg||
nt|josj: 2 trump tricks to come for -3, 150 to Jatim|pg||

nt|josj: 6m|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Hope so:) |pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: I can't understand that some ain't able to look for a pan. Lost was hard. Here was no problems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But for the bridge nope|pg||
nt|josj: and a pretty good one too, well over 30%|pg||

nt|westjava: ambitious West|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Here we even are near 45%. Look at the @C.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing normal NT range easily end in 2S|pg||
nt|josj: yes but @S 3-2 first...|pg||
nt|josj: interesting|pg||
nt|josj: S has to establish his @S, I think|pg||
nt|josj: and again EW stay rather passive|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: sort of an anticlimax as they did not even reach the 5-level :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: a strange lead!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  when pd bid 2@c I assumed W would take some aggressive action (like 4@c) and force NS to play in one of their red suits.|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt in N works|pg||
nt|josj: dd that is :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|westjava: this semi final play 2 x 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, they played 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: NS heading towards slam here so the play might be relevant...|pg||
nt|josj: I think Taufik will win the match for his team if he makes this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might me who don't understand anything here.|pg||
nt|josj:  17 is a big swing to Geo|pg||
nt|josj: 2 overtricks and maybe 3|pg||
nt|westjava: still on the safe level I think|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|josj: except on a @D lead by W (which I expect)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ws 1NT was?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Do u trust ure pard when u play Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: well, W's 1@S kept NS out of their 4-4 fit but 3NT is a safe spot|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|josj: no,  17 is a surprise push|pg||
nt|josj: but still, Taufik has to make; if he goes down, his side loses the lead|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe -1 westjava|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: in OR, declarer got a club lead and then successfully ran the @HJ which held...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: % for a honor+1 in @C is 16.2. But is it the A or Q now?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: A or J I ment. Sr.|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bookmark this for a bit help: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not EW used weak NT before by there card? And now 16 + full X for it?|pg||
nt|josj: but with the @H friendly, 4@S would not have been in any danger|pg||
nt|josj: now W will establish his @D|pg||
nt|josj: EW can even make 3nt DD but 3@C will go down on a @S ruff whereas bidding 3nt is a bridge too far|pg||
nt|josj: so getting plus might be OK for EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: best chance of 12 tricks and least chance of a defensive ruff somewhere|pg||

mb|2H|nt|josj: why not?|pg||
nt|josj: like they did in the 1st segment, Tobing-Asbi miss a non-vul. game|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: or 3NT , sorry|pg||
nt|april7: will end up in 3NT and S has to guess everything especially after a @C lead, but W will lead @H mostprobably|pg||

nt|josj: good lead, W will probably settle for 8 tricks now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzhu: rotate board|pg||
nt|josj: as I thought...|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: North held South's hand and West held East's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so this is probably going to make at an important stage of this short match|pg||
nt|josj: but even then, it might be difficult to avoid getting a 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: nice X by W|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but those you always know wha to do:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: I just wander where N found his exstra by the bad 14H?|pg||
nt|josj: after the positive response, E immediately went after the aces|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C shows a decent suit and something more than that|pg||
nt|don_kapu: difficult decision for Manoppo|pg||
nt|josj: though, with 3@H on for EW, it does not matter that much|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: which will give declarer a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East must have been quite close to opening 2@C, if that option is available|pg||
nt|josj: to beat this, a quick @H shift is needed|pg||
nt|josj: good lead for the def.|pg||
nt|westjava: Hardy cooling down on this hand...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|rodal f: I understand S by the bid. Hard to see the nice fit.|pg||
nt|josj: good they did...|pg||
nt|josj: so they duplicate the 2nd best OR result here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: he was taking an advanced save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H often a easy raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing for EW|pg||
nt|josj: declarer left to his own resources|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 2 down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: E found the best lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  W should duck|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andyv:  and EW did bid the slam on board 5|pg||
nt|josj: if NS miss another game, they will lose the lead temporarily|pg||
nt|josj: better not to open W hand|pg||
nt|josj: the last board of this long day brings us a slam off the @S AK|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 2@S is a good final contract though the lucky @D split might produce a second overtrick|pg||
nt|josj: and here they have a chance to turn their advantage into a decent enough win|pg||
nt|josj: they have to be cashed at once, however...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: kind of astonishing N bid only 3S over the transfer. |pg||

nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
nt|josj: in OR S opened 1@S so game was inevitable|pg||
nt|westjava: Thanks a lot to BBO, for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers world wide..!|pg||
nt|josj: the previous board, even more so as you may go down in 3@H|pg||

nt|don_kapu: King Arthur the Lion Hearth|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: slam is too high with a probably @D loser and a shaky @S fit |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||

pc|sA|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
nt|westjava: last but no least,special thanks to Arifin Halim (Indonesia) and of course Roland Wald (Denmark), who organize this all show for us|pg||
nt|don_kapu: thanks all and have a nice days|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||

nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
nt|josj: a @C lead certainly is best|pg||
nt|josj: now look at the @H break...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||
nt|josj: maybe declarer has a chance now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|westjava: cu on next VU after short break in 15 minutes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: W faces an unpleasant lead problem now|pg||
nt|josj: so far he has done well|pg||
nt|westjava: on the last round of Qualification|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done South|pg||
nt|josj: but 4@S is OK, losing 2@S and a @D|pg||
nt|josj: nice play, this low @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||
nt|josj: what would this @S8 mean? encouraging, count?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: needed an unlkely @H to prevent the 2nd overtrick I think; N will be squeezed later on...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|josj: 6@D would have been excellent at about 90% but neither team attempted it|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ferlema: 3 multas|pg||
nt|andyv:  should take this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times some could have been taken. Onse from NS and twice from EW. It cost a bit by miss the alert.|pg||
nt|josj: but not if you throw dummy's @D|pg||
nt|josj: if you lead the first @D from W you cannot go wrong...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: I am still wondering about the scoring of  9|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: so the final score should be 19-11 VP to Riau A.|pg||
nt|josj: in fact, across the archipelago, we have a Riau province on Sumatra's mainland...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  will cost an imp|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|josj: anyway: this is the last board of the 1st quarter. We will go on shortly|pg||

nt|westjava: @C@H>>>Jayalah Bridge Indonesia..!!<<<@H@C (them song of March Bridge Indonesia)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|april7: but even if N overcalls , might be not easy to reach 4 @S, now it could be a good score for EW, even if W goes down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: the king play caters to any honour in the North hand, as well as the actual layout|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|josj: which will enable the players to enjoy a longish dinner break|pg||
