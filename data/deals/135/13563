nt|andyv:  W would probably lebensohl (if they play that) into @cs... can anyone dbl that?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|woozle: West would probably pass and let East find a way out..East would bid diamonds and do poorly|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Alfa starts with one diamond with his exciting hand...I think the alternative, non-vul, is 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: Sofyan has an easy double, and Sumampouw has to choose how high to drive|pg||
nt|andyv:  should stop at 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  lack of Aces and sterile distribution don't bode well for S|pg||
nt|woozle: Sofyan goes with a very cautious 2S - cautious because game is probably laydown any time that partner has four spades and a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|woozle: sorry, Sumampouw|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sofyan tries for slam, very aggressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  splinter... now S may bid 4@h|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  and N will get excited|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sofyan should be content with 4S for now...4D was an overbid already|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: slam is pretty good - a finesse through the opening bidder|pg||
nt|andyv:  why splinter.. get a cue from pd and sign off?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|woozle: He doesn't have enough to drive the level higher|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|woozle: 4H can be a courtesy effort...there's a fair argument that South should have kicked again|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec says 4@d is asking for control... not sure of what|pg||
nt|woozle: sounds unlikely when the hand looks exactly like a splinter|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4@h is no control or Ace... interesting|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|woozle: no ace isn't bad news for north|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, 4@s turns out to be a good spot for S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|woozle: I assume that declarer will at least make 4S, 3-4 imps in with the other table going for only 300 in 5DX|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: NS have good hands, but they have a tough act to follow - the other room bid to 7NT and made it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  plenty of tricks there|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Alfa misses his chance to influence the hand with a favourable weak two|pg||
nt|woozle: That might give East a chance to influence the outcome|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|woozle: EW can save to a  fair level in spades...7S goes for 2000-2300|pg||
nt|woozle: South needs to RKC for hearts, then 7NT is easy|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: should play 4nt here as rkc for h|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|woozle: maybe it's ambiguous, or RKC for diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: could play 4d as rkc for d|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Alfa doubles 3S, but he can't beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: Sumampouw happy now, he was able to bid 4NT when partner's last bid was hearts|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Definitely an error to play this with a trump suit - 7NT, with three choices of running suit, might make when any of them break dreadfully|pg||
nt|andyv:  hope that shows 0-3|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Situation should be clear to Sumampouw...partner can't have zero|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Sumampouw should bid 7N for a simple reason... probably can handle 4-1@h break in NT|pg||
nt|woozle: Well done...NS passed the test|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|woozle: only twelve on top, but either red suit can produce a thirteenth trick, or any four card red suit with West would result in a squeeze in that suit plus spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  a brief moment of anxiety until one of the red suits split|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|woozle: best if you need a squeeze to make it, then it's a potential swing...this is just a flat board - three overtricks in 7NT|pg||
mc|13|nt|andyv:  Barry Crane would not have been happy with a 7 bid.|pg||
pg||
qx|o13|st||md|3SA54HA65DT4CK6543,ST32HQT4DK9532C97,SKQ76HKJ8DQJ87CQJ,SJ98H9732DA6CAT82|sv|b|nt|woozle: Barry Crane was not a great imps player|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sofyan opens 1D with his 15 low card points|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  he did ok but that was his reputation|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|woozle: Sumampouw starts with an odd-looking 1H response..is this hand so hard?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  trying to right side NT perhaps?|pg||
nt|woozle: Now a big overbid with 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|woozle: Maybe he thinks he plays the cards better than his partner|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty strange auction by south|pg||
pc|d7|nt|woozle: West leads a diamond, which is a bit of a longshot with his suit underneath North's|pg||
nt|woozle: then again, the breaks are so benign that ten tricks are easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably didn't like 2N, so decided to await further developments by making a waiting bid of 1@h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|woozle: I suppose it's consistent - 3NT is about as good a bid as 1H|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|woozle: Maybe 3H from Sofyan now, giving up on spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle: Sofyan thinks that 6/5 shapes are for defending notrumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: On a club lead, this will be a quick 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|woozle: Hard to see a losing line in 3NT with any chance of making, so an unimpressive result from the closed room EW|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|woozle: 10 tricks available, although likely only 9 will be made if a heart shift is found|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone suggested a heart lead might threaten 3NT, but one heart duck and the north hand will never see the lead again|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|woozle: Sofyan shows his hearts at trick three...would have been more effective to show them during the auction|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  and the match tightens|pg||
nt|woozle: Poor result from EW in the closed room...6C looks playable on these breaks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: Alfa shows his minors, and Hendy should bid 5C|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in OR, declarer tried to xruff the hand and eventually lost control|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  looks like at least down 800|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  did S bid to make?|pg||
nt|woozle: Sumampouw disregards the vulnerability with 5H...this should be down at least two|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe Sofyan shouldn't have bid 3H with a six count and three small hearts|pg||
nt|woozle: feels like three down...can't get to dummy to pick up trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on partnership style... did Sumampouw expect more for the 3@h bid?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  most people play unusual vs. unusual... so 3@h is simply a raise... not even invitational.|pg||
nt|woozle: Even so, you don't have to bid|pg||
nt|woozle: Not every crappy hand that bids 2H has to bid 3H|pg||
nt|woozle: maybe 1100...might run into a diamond ruff and a slow diamond loser|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 800|pg||
nt|woozle: Diamond 5 is poor though...should lead the jack, to allow East to not ruff unless the queen is played|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|hT|pc|s4|nt|woozle: now declarer can draw trumps and claim, only 14 imps away|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that was warp drive|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly would not be unreasonable|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|baldjean: I would not open any of these hands|pg||
nt|josj: I wonder where this will end. There are 12 tricks in @C for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will S stop afer the minorbid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: after*|pg||
nt|josj: @C 2-2, @S finessable etc.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ferlema: 1NT en todos los casos|pg||
nt|baldjean: but these days almost anything ill be opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d has a lot of play EW but hard to get to.... probably will settle for 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: but still, 6@C could only be called one of the better Roland slams :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ferlema: Vigil ha ganado 12 IMPs por la mala desicion de Gabriel|pg||
nt|baldjean: will*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: 5@C is the sensible spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I waited a @H support Jos and u have the minor support.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: N has a hand that should be opened|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|nt|josj: W might have tried 5@C over 4@D|pg||

nt|rodal f: Next @D4?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: From S.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: one grand slam deserves anoher, but this one makes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: an alien freeze ray has been launched from a spaceship over sumatra|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK, in 30 seconds if nothing changes i decree that W has to play in 5H|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: now he has to take all @S finesses which he will duly do, I assume|pg||
nt|josj: maybe better to play opener for @DA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else he have a problem.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: good alternative: giving up another @D and throwing the @S|pg||
nt|josj: so @C and @DK now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be easy I belive but....|pg||
nt|josj: after the previous board, nothing is easy for E|pg||
nt|rodal f: But seems as @C need to be 2-2 for that. So a thinking anyway.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ferlema: con el pik repartido 3/3 hay 11 bazas|pg||

nt|woozle: oddly, North does best here to lead diamonds early, to kill the only entry to the west hand|pg||
nt|woozle: tough to figure that one out|pg||
nt|andyv:  how many pairs play 2@d as natural in that position?|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't think that I do...sounds like a general force/good raise|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: I would bid 1NT, which has the merit of making it easy for partner to pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why the E hand is just not worth that much unless a @h fit can be found|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  and be a level lower.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|woozle: North does best to switch to a heart here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  he was listening:)|pg||
nt|woozle: the eight is a nice technical choice, in case west has a singleton seven|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point|pg||

pc|c6|nt|andyv:  low @d to hand now?|pg||

mb|p|nt|baldjean: this wil be a standard 4@s for E/W|pg||
nt|april7: strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5 of minor seems to be the best spot for NS|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  probably 2@s here|pg||
nt|andyv:  followed by @d raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|april7: most probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it - 3@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||
nt|josj: which may lead to 3NT..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N doesn't bid NT, South probably should be weary of it.|pg||
nt|josj: yes but will he?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: How do EW pan a weak NT? I needed.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: the hands fit well, no club wastage|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C rebid by S is 9 minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes I wonder what the purpose of finding a fit is|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s7|nt|andyv:  or they have some other type of understandings about this sequence|pg||
nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N realised there was no room fo too many S cards in S hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Adi may have noticed the previous NT (board 4) and decided not to take a chance:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzhu: closing |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|april7: the J of @H makes the game if opponents lead trumps in 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, game makes here, but it does not seem a major crime to miss it |pg||
nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||
nt|april7: but I think the vulnerability makes it worthwile|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the West hand is hard to evaluate - 5332 shape, three small clubs|pg||

nt|andyv:  a good victory for Gabrial team|pg||
nt|woozle: But that's unlikely, since their EW pair has another poor result, -300 in 3NTX|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: just the 2 successive misplays in CR|pg||
