nt|rodal f: Any to come from EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit nice by % now.|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
mb|4D|mb|5H|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1NT=2/1 it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: even more so after this X|pg||
mb|6D|nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: well, he might realise that they won't run in OR either...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ferlema: no|pg||
nt|ferlema: que mal|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trèbol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a interesting variant from u Job.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|josj: still possible to make as N should hold 4 @S and thus 5-4-2-2|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|josj: rehi|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|josj: should be made now as a @C goes on the @DA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  5@d does have a shot since a @s will be led... may be time to set up @cs for pitch of @hs (highly unlikely but stranger things have happened)|pg||
nt|josj: cashing out for -1|pg||
nt|josj: if declarer guesses right on the obvious @C return|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  if N is going to bid with that hand over 1N, he may as well have opened 2@s to begin with|pg||

nt|andyv:  certainly would not be unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldjean: I would not open any of these hands|pg||
nt|josj: I wonder where this will end. There are 12 tricks in @C for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will S stop afer the minorbid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: after*|pg||
nt|josj: @C 2-2, @S finessable etc.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway a good stop for EW.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ferlema: 1NT en todos los casos|pg||
nt|baldjean: but these days almost anything ill be opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d has a lot of play EW but hard to get to.... probably will settle for 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: but still, 6@C could only be called one of the better Roland slams :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3N|nt|ferlema: Vigil ha ganado 12 IMPs por la mala desicion de Gabriel|pg||
nt|baldjean: will*|pg||
nt|rodal f: SR. How mad I was when I came back.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took N as the platers and EWdef.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: 5@C is the sensible spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I waited a @H support Jos and u have the minor support.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: N has a hand that should be opened|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|josj: W might have tried 5@C over 4@D|pg||
nt|josj: some work to do for declarer, even if 2@D shows majors and thus marks the @H position|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next @D4?|pg||
nt|josj: selamat siang and hello to all kibz|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: I ain't shure by the 2NT there. Often force.|pg||
nt|josj: this is rather high on an HCP-basis but with the @S finesse onside, it might have made...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Wantedto say the same:) Jos.|pg||
nt|josj: I am wondering where Noldy George found his extras|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have there deal we can see.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: From S.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: one grand slam deserves anoher, but this one makes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: an alien freeze ray has been launched from a spaceship over sumatra|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK, in 30 seconds if nothing changes i decree that W has to play in 5H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else 2NT never would have comed.|pg||
nt|josj: well, sooner or later the finesse of the @H9 would have been necessary had it not come down in the second round of the suit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|josj: now he has to take all @S finesses which he will duly do, I assume|pg||
nt|josj: maybe better to play opener for @DA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Else he have a problem.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: But only by there HP fit. Did they know?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Often as here 3 (4) @S and a singleton.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came by 4@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am to slow specs. A bit sorry for that.|pg||
nt|josj: play is slow, maybe?|pg||
nt|josj: Kalimantan missed the slam but at least, they end up in a playable contract and will thus register their first imps of the match|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|josj: good alternative: giving up another @D and throwing the @S|pg||
nt|josj: so @C and @DK now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be easy I belive but....|pg||
nt|josj: after the previous board, nothing is easy for E|pg||
nt|rodal f: But seems as @C need to be 2-2 for that. So a thinking anyway.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ferlema: con el pik repartido 3/3 hay 11 bazas|pg||
pc|c2|nt|josj: well, 3@D must have shown something...|pg||
nt|josj: the easiest way to continue now is to drop the @CK doubleton - a matter of restricted choice once N follows suit with the @C10 first|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: @D 4-3 is enough|pg||
nt|josj: they have been playing at lightning speed all day|pg||

nt|westjava: good morning,afternoon and evening!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|josj: nice misfit in EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @D as save?|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: our other match is Geology Timah vs Bhineka|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was a costful one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this wil be a standard 4@s for E/W|pg||
nt|april7: strength|pg||
nt|josj: I am told it's 20 boards only so dinner break is tight now and we will con tinue at 19.00 hrs WIB, in just over 2 hrs (13.00 GMT)|pg||
nt|josj: N can just avoid being squeezed out of his pointed stopppers, I think|pg||
nt|josj: Strothis ng Club|pg||
nt|josj: strong club this time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  5 of minor seems to be the best spot for NS|pg||
nt|josj: this too looks like a routine 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: dinner right now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a bit fun to look at NS cards in the beginning. BUT....|pg||
nt|josj: interesting hand: on the "obvious" @SK lead you make 7@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||
nt|josj: but it needs a @D ruff in  front of dummy to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably 2@s here|pg||
nt|andyv:  followed by @d raise|pg||
nt|josj: and 5@D is the wrong spot to be|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N whould bid 4NT to suggest a twosuiter;|pg||
nt|josj: if he gets 5@C, 5@D willl the show the reds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|april7: most probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it - 3@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||
nt|josj: which may lead to 3NT..|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N doesn't bid NT, South probably should be weary of it.|pg||
nt|josj: yes but will he?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: How do EW pan a weak NT? I needed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the hands fit well, no club wastage|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope:)|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C rebid by S is 9 minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes I wonder what the purpose of finding a fit is|pg||
nt|josj: not enough tricks in a @H slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N has nothing to say here|pg||
nt|josj: advanced daisy-picking?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: very good lead by Fauzi...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C was MSA, I think and 3@H showed @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: S trying to find out about the remote chance of a @D slam|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  wow... I guess he does|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might some fun to come anyway. N don't like his @C and press S.|pg||
nt|rodal f: That wrong I was:)|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT is a lucky make with @C blocked and @DQ coming down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  or they have some other type of understandings about this sequence|pg||
nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, N realised there was no room fo too many S cards in S hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  Adi may have noticed the previous NT (board 4) and decided not to take a chance:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: closing |pg||
nt|rodal f: Isit that lucky by %?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: in % it should be called very lucky|pg||
nt|rodal f: Com si com sa. But I agree it u. Ure end by bidding would have been?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
nt|josj: on the @SK lead, 5@D is through|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: the J of @H makes the game if opponents lead trumps in 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, game makes here, but it does not seem a major crime to miss it |pg||
nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||
nt|april7: but I think the vulnerability makes it worthwile|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the West hand is hard to evaluate - 5332 shape, three small clubs|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing normal NT range easily end in 2S|pg||
nt|josj: yes but @S 3-2 first...|pg||
nt|josj: interesting|pg||
nt|josj: S has to establish his @S, I think|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|westjava: a strange lead!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  when pd bid 2@c I assumed W would take some aggressive action (like 4@c) and force NS to play in one of their red suits.|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt in N works|pg||
nt|josj: dd that is :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|westjava: this semi final play 2 x 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, they played 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: NS heading towards slam here so the play might be relevant...|pg||
nt|josj: I think Taufik will win the match for his team if he makes this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might me who don't understand anything here.|pg||
nt|josj:  17 is a big swing to Geo|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|josj: except on a @D lead by W (which I expect)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ws 1NT was?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Do u trust ure pard when u play Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: well, W's 1@S kept NS out of their 4-4 fit but 3NT is a safe spot|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hA|nt|josj: no,  17 is a surprise push|pg||
nt|josj: but still, Taufik has to make; if he goes down, his side loses the lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: % for a honor+1 in @C is 16.2. But is it the A or Q now?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bookmark this for a bit help: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not EW used weak NT before by there card? And now 16 + full X for it?|pg||

nt|andyv:  W happy to be out of it... does everyone Michael's the E hand with 6@s and 5@c?|pg||
nt|josj: this looks strange|pg||
nt|josj: I think E opened 1NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: now 2NT from North presumably|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway 5@D is safe.|pg||
nt|rodal f: for u now Jos?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|josj: 1NT rebid now shows 15-17 as NS play weak NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: what happened in OR? I cannot believe this result...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D and 2@D was inverted minor it seems. I use it when I have 5.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|josj: why not?|pg||
nt|josj: like they did in the 1st segment, Tobing-Asbi miss a non-vul. game|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: or 3NT , sorry|pg||
nt|april7: will end up in 3NT and S has to guess everything especially after a @C lead, but W will lead @H mostprobably|pg||
nt|andyv:  just curious if some restrict themselves to only the minor can be longer|pg||
nt|josj: occasionally, you hold a 7-6|pg||
nt|josj: maybe the board is misplaced on the table|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzhu: rotate board|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  and EW did bid the slam on board 5|pg||
nt|josj: if NS miss another game, they will lose the lead temporarily|pg||
nt|josj: better not to open W hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: 2@S is a good final contract though the lucky @D split might produce a second overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: kind of astonishing N bid only 3S over the transfer. |pg||
mb|2D|nt|josj: nor the E hand btw :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will not like this|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't agree by the biddings at non of them.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N alerted multi and E to be killed?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ferlema: sin ser exitista, muy bien Sur y Oeste|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: X=3c suppost I presume|pg||
nt|josj: the intervention was slightly mistimed but how could E know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt even have a double of FIVE spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: support*|pg||
nt|josj: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|josj: but a little ambitious maybe, under 50%|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||
nt|josj: well, had the @C been able to run, 3NT would have been a fine shot|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: well done South|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: 6@D would have been excellent at about 90% but neither team attempted it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  now duck @s twice|pg||
nt|andyv:  once|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|ferlema: 3 multas|pg||
nt|andyv:  should take this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times some could have been taken. Onse from NS and twice from EW. It cost a bit by miss the alert.|pg||
nt|josj: but not if you throw dummy's @D|pg||
nt|josj: if you lead the first @D from W you cannot go wrong...|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|josj: I am still wondering about the scoring of  9|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|josj: anyway: this is the last board of the 1st quarter. We will go on shortly|pg||
nt|josj: N is marked with the ace so that is what declarer will probably do|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|april7: but even if N overcalls , might be not easy to reach 4 @S, now it could be a good score for EW, even if W goes down|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the king play caters to any honour in the North hand, as well as the actual layout|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|josj: which will enable the players to enjoy a longish dinner break|pg||
