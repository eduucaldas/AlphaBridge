nt|vugraphzcu: N/S complicated transfer system...will do my best|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This lead helped declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: kibbitzer asks the very reasonable question as to how it is possible that Gold can even play the gamne iof he is my son|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: this is easy +1  at least |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: Townsend had a difficult lead I agree|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double club finesse and spade finesse were always bringing home this contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: agree mike, but on a hand like W, I prefer a @h lead|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been my choice too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sT|pc|c9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: bear uin mind that the 2@d bid was artificial |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|10|nt|h_karluk: whenever i have to lead asking same question, partner may have values, but are they useful?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: but how high will N bid?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe that's the factor which you choose to be aggressive or passive|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A nice activeW.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @c is single suited?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (looking at hand is my guess) |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bucheister: they play transfers in this competitve auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is dont (single suited) |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: ooops right, (from spec)  that is capp |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bucheister: that is a bold bid by S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: hi John :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: on their trapeze with no net being vulnerable |pg||
nt|rodal f: NS might had a chance by 3NTat a unlucky defence, but not now. I belived.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website with standings after round 7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bucheister: I am surprised that W did not bid 3S; how about you Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you |pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: you mean E?|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has a junky 9 count |pg||
nt|bucheister: I think the hammer is about to come down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W could bid 3 with the 4  (super accept)|pg||
nt|bucheister: No I was thinking W|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am just surpised that S has taken 2 bids |pg||
nt|bucheister: If EW is careful they can get this for 800|pg||
nt|bucheister: Do you think that NS had a misunderstanding about 2C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: hi every one, sry late|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|deltadash: hi, not a problem, glad you're here :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i wonder now which is he least of evils in east's perspective|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bucheister: Oh my goodness|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good and pard  (N) gets to play it....|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the least|pg||
mc|9|nt|sybarra: I wonder if it was misunderstood |pg||
pg||

nt|deltadash: Indo Power needs to get the ball rolling :)|pg||
nt|westjava: both NS and EW play precision|pg||
nt|deltadash: that's a good thing - not necessary to explain lots of things|pg||
nt|lestergold: grand for e/w!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 tricks in 3 denominations|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak multi|nt|westjava: 192-74 = 118 for 32 boards..??|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: doesn't look too hopeful, does it?|pg||
nt|bucheister: hard to understand; maybe they thought it was DONT; clubs plus another??|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all. Could have saved one but still it was a gamling.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I was reminded it should be capp (single suited) |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we do not know for sure |pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like a club system |pg||
nt|bucheister: I sure hope so, or they are in trouble again|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit interesting to see if NS can stay of a slam bid. BUT HOW?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 11 tricks everywhere is what I see |pg||
nt|h_karluk: imagine what could be a start?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|pass or correct to 3!h|nt|lestergold: but nowm its thegarve's turn to put one  in|pg||
mb|d!|nt|h_karluk: tom'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Tom's cooperation needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold starts with a quiet double how far will cookeGarvie stick their necks out here to mess the auction up|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: it's interesting that the opponents aren't silent|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2N from Tow3nsend?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 3@c is ideal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too weak in my opinion with 2nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would seem to express townsend's values|pg||
mb|3N|nt|westjava: is mission imposible, posible?|pg||
nt|deltadash: lol - we'll see :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@c from E?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that is gung ho for the copnservatiove Townsend|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think they will reach it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: which one sacrifice here?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: NT was forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe only 10 in spades? |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: not sure of precision bids but I think 1 nt =good hand  |pg||
nt|rodal f: 3NT= max showed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. I was wrong.|pg||
nt|bucheister: there are so many forms of Precision that it is hard to tell; 1nt usually shows 8-13 balanced|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N top spot but no shame to play in 7@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all bids besides 4@c are worse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and after 4@c it must be easy to bid 7@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|deltadash: good question :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inbvite given and ..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Invite|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: that was N had |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree. The most normal is relay by 2NT or 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: better pass N |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|h_karluk: i think David got 'em|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec asks wjhat is 4@s ik would think it is cue agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: asking for @cQ OR extra length|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h a grand slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D are normaly. Do u have helpin that color. Bid 4. Might wrong this time.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h asking for @c Q or length|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could not leave as a hard decision after Tom's simple calls|pg||
mb|5N|nt|rodal f: But might the 3@S=fit made an other quest. I don't know.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@c must be a six card suit headed by AKL so Townsend should bid 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hes passed buck back|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: I will need to shut down and restart after this hand, pls bear with me|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|deltadash: looks ambitious all around, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I may be wrong about the meaning of these bids|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Well done!|pg||
