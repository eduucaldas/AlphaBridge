mb|1C|nt|josj: selamat malam Batam & sekitarnya :)|pg||
nt|josj: good day (or whatever) to all others|pg||
nt|josj: this time it's East Java playing East Borneo (Kal.)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Re hi all nice spec and co commentators:)|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam and rehi all for the closing segment of the final|pg||
nt|josj: 10 more boards to go to decide a winner|pg||
nt|josj: though there i something strange in the Kalimantan team: at this table, a strong pair from Manado (North Celebes) is playing for them... |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: selamat siang untuk Indonesia and hello to all other spectators|pg||
nt|josj: is|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: Not 4@D from W?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice cards for NS but a bad layout in @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: rehi RÃ¸dal|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|josj: sry: I mean East Java, of course, I was talking about Rogi-Wohon|pg||
nt|josj: they are Manadonese|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often u like to play 4 in major here afterthe opening and the 3@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S is not down yet...trumplead is best :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@Dminisplinter and @S it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: here we have another match of the Inter-Provinces qualifications|pg||
nt|josj: selamat sore untuk Indonesia and hello again to all other spectators|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ferlema: aparentemente dos multas|pg||
nt|josj: I hope South bid 1@S over 1@C and not East|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Liked west by the try. Non vul|pg||
nt|josj: it's good for your geographical knowledge of the country :)|pg||
nt|josj: but anyway, NS started off by missing a reasonably cold slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: so NS escaped the axe here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ferlema: una baza de triunfo @D A y K y @C A y K|pg||
nt|josj: 6NT needs @D 5-0 to go down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: 6@S is worse but still well over 50% so a good second choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: selamat sore and good morning/evening etc. to all of you|pg||
nt|josj: this lead will certainly do declarer no harm|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Took the full speed?|pg||
nt|josj: this time, the team from South Celebes (Makassar) is facing South Sumatra (Palembang)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: extra tricks|pg||

pc|sA|nt|baldjean: will be a quick claim|pg||
nt|josj: well, we have to be stuck as there is little to think about in playing this contract :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: The safe line against 05 is?|pg||
nt|josj: @CAK now and then declarer knows trumps atr 5-0|pg||
nt|josj: are|pg||
nt|josj: not touching trumps at all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|josj: I think this is a Round 7 match between the West Java and North Sumatra teams so it's Bandung v. Medan|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzhu: revioke|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|josj: Here is the final of the Indonesian National Clubs Championships|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jos Jacobs and Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|josj: selamat siang Batam and good moring/evening to all other kibz|pg||
nt|josj: hi Roland and Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jos, Roland and specs|pg||
nt|rodal f: for      for    * GRR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u feel that WE was a bit lucky here Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: playing Geologi Timah, fro Bandung's Geological Institute|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well I asked for the best line.|pg||
nt|josj: lead a @C raher than a @H from dummy to find out the exact layout|pg||
nt|josj: so a very lucky escape there with 4@S easily made|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: not really|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was. Dont play thrumh. Asu said Jos:)|pg||
nt|josj: with @CQJ10 and the three-card @S in E, there should have been an automatic squeeze for 13 tricks but declarer did not bother (nor did I).|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: S got what he was looking for|pg||
mb|1C|nt|baldjean: let's see if E/W play garbage stayman|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|andyv:  should stop at 4@s|pg||
nt|josj: Laksamana is a team from Pekanbaru, not too far away from Batam|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzhh: ...|pg||
nt|josj: 3@S would not have been my cup of tea but it effectievly takes away 3HT as a landing spot for W|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT|pg||
nt|josj: with both rounded finesses working, 5@D makes even if played by East so the save would have been correct had it not gone down too much (-5, maybe...)|pg||
nt|josj: but we will see...|pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: Gabrial is one of the teams representing UI: Universitas Indonesia|pg||
nt|josj: this is in Depok, 40 km S of Jakarta |pg||
nt|rodal f: No comment here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2 and 3 @D my fealing was 4@D from W but he did right by the X.|pg||
nt|rodal f: feeling*|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: apparently they do|pg||
nt|josj: Tommy Rogi did the right thing, anyway...|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: MGTH means"may good things happen"|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but it always remains to be seen for which side :)|pg||
nt|josj: and a more quiet deal here but 7 tricks are far away for EW, I think|pg||
nt|josj: and so does Octa...|pg||
nt|josj: so we might need a calculator here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ferlema: este torneo sirve de preparacion para el proximo campeonato sudamericano,,, toda la info click aqui: http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010.htm|pg||
nt|josj: is a grand a good proposition here?|pg||
nt|josj: again trump lead is best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|baldjean: the way cards lie even 4 woujld make though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|josj: and this time,the leader has a few of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot I like. Could have been better at an other contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but the contract not really in danger anyway|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C, 3@H and exit in @D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: 3@C que by @D|pg||
nt|josj: hi Adi :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  S thankful he has 9 tricks off the top|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Pass to come for a chech at first control.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ferlema: si quieren ver la lista de participantes en el Campeonato Sudamericano de Parejas click aqui; http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010paranot.htm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: NO?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: this saves an undertrick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|soban: from other semi final GEOLOGI TIMAH leading 30 imps againt BHINEKA (Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Jemmy Bojoh, Leslie Gontha)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why could not N pass for a check at @S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Keng by a good one there|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: this is teams so np |pg||
nt|rodal f: If u don't cover a honor u don't have (the@SQ)|pg||
nt|josj: now he can always ruff a club and throw one on @DK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|josj: there go the @H tricks for the def.|pg||
nt|josj: -4 I can calculate by heart :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ferlema: con la linea que esta jugando Esteban hay 10 bazas|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks even|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: ? How could Tobing find that??|pg||
nt|josj: throw the last club and play trumps...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|josj: we saw something like that in the Premier League as well|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|josj: not very interesting at imps though ...in short matches, every imp might count|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: A auto small?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ment the Q@S, but some other chances was there so ok.|pg||
nt|josj: trying to play safe|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|nt|soban: right Josj.|pg||
nt|josj: if either red suit breaks 3-2, there are 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||

nt|josj: we are hoping to get some info on what happened on  22 shortly|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we switched rooms... the open room still not up|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all red, S should buy this for 4@h|pg||
nt|josj: in the 2 previous matches they did not as these matches both ended in a blitz|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A very normal contract by 21HPEW it was.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|josj: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|baldjean: 3nt is my prediction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|josj: selamat sore Indonesia and (re) hi to all of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW can escape for a tolerable penalty against 3N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ferlema: al margen que Norte y Sur tomaron la buena desicion de jugar en el 4/4|pg||
nt|soban: While Denny (Sacul - Franky Karwur, Donny Tuerah memed Hendrawan) play for Syabas Energy fail go to semi final.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weak NT came at 3rd hand again for NS. |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now a very tolerable penalty. D lead best|pg||
nt|josj: easy going for EW to the right contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|josj: this is a Round 8 match in the qualifications. They are about halfway through it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeÃ±a ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's 2nd dbl probably influenced by the vul|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
nt|josj: on a  @S lead this might be problematic|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: though I would have had sympathy for a @H lead as well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ferlema: el declarante debe tratar de hacer dos bazas de espadas, una de corazon, tres de diamante y cuatro de trebol|pg||
nt|josj: Here we see the host province, Riau Archipel, v. South Kalimantan (Borneo)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ferlema: pequeÃ±o error de Norte que debio desbloquear el palo de trebol sirviendo el J|pg||
nt|ferlema: conservqndo una entrada adicional al muerto conservando el @C 10 como entrada|pg||
nt|ferlema: en este caso va a pasar desapercibido|pg||
nt|josj: and this an easy game as well|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: if def. play @H dummy has to ruff with relatively high trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Can't see any possible fun here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have a safe 10er if they play normal.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: OK, but a small would have been better.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  W needed to lead a @d... he's still looking for one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|josj: well, missing the slam o the first board was worth 13 imps to Kaltim|pg||

nt|rodal f: Any to come from EW?|pg||
nt|josj: but a reverse swing is likely on the board they just completed...|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|josj: maybe, they are a little tired after more than 60 boards today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit nice by % now.|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: it's hard work, they started at 9 am or so to complete 7 rounds...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarÃ  con 3 @H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: 1NT=2/1 it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: even more so after this X|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
nt|josj: this seemed a more approproate moment for N to try a short suit lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
nt|josj: in the meantime, declarer went down in his good 4@H when he lost control of the trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazÃ³n|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
nt|josj: if you don't take all your finesses, you might go down|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||
nt|josj: after the @S lead, @HA and low to the jack looks best, also for reasons of communication|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to guess what the best line is|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: well, he might realise that they won't run in OR either...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ferlema: no|pg||
nt|ferlema: que mal|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: you might play @HA and another, hoping to avoid the ruff...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trÃ¨bol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a interesting variant from u Job.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-2 at the odds. 68%|pg||

pc|d2|nt|josj: there is the losing @H finesse coming up...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT was force for one round and from there the @S was lost. Just the @Cto hit now.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|josj: remarkable swing to JB on  1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: in which case the @DA has to be right|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Next @D4?|pg||

nt|josj: well, sooner or later the finesse of the @H9 would have been necessary had it not come down in the second round of the suit|pg||

pc|h6|nt|josj: now he has to take all @S finesses which he will duly do, I assume|pg||

pc|h7|nt|rodal f: But only by there HP fit. Did they know?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Often as here 3 (4) @S and a singleton.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came by 4@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am to slow specs. A bit sorry for that.|pg||
nt|josj: play is slow, maybe?|pg||
nt|josj: Kalimantan missed the slam but at least, they end up in a playable contract and will thus register their first imps of the match|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|josj: good alternative: giving up another @D and throwing the @S|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andyv:  5 of minor seems to be the best spot for NS|pg||

mb|2C|nt|josj: dinner right now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a bit fun to look at NS cards in the beginning. BUT....|pg||
nt|josj: interesting hand: on the "obvious" @SK lead you make 7@H|pg||
nt|josj: partscore battle, to be won by NS perforce|pg||
nt|josj: if N introduces his suit at any time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||
nt|josj: but it needs a @D ruff in  front of dummy to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably 2@s here|pg||
nt|andyv:  followed by @d raise|pg||
nt|josj: and 5@D is the wrong spot to be|pg||

mb|4S|nt|josj: assuming 1@D is Precisio, here we have the disadvante of it|pg||
nt|josj: tage|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||
nt|april7: most probably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it - 3@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||
nt|josj: which may lead to 3NT..|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
nt|josj: or even -140|pg||
nt|josj: now|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: Strong Club but 2@S then was an overbid, taking the 1@D into account|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: now the clubs seem blocked :)|pg||
nt|josj: no double, no trouble...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||

nt|josj: advanced daisy-picking?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: very good lead by Fauzi...|pg||

nt|andyv:  wow... I guess he does|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  or they have some other type of understandings about this sequence|pg||
nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||

nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
nt|josj: on the @SK lead, 5@D is through|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|april7: the J of @H makes the game if opponents lead trumps in 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: and ofcourse the trump break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously, game makes here, but it does not seem a major crime to miss it |pg||
nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: I think they will get to 4@H here easily|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hope so:) |pg||

nt|rodal f: Do they need?|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S preparing the save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H did not surprice me but 4@S did.|pg||

nt|josj: but this makes it easy going|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: I can't understand that some ain't able to look for a pan. Lost was hard. Here was no problems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But for the bridge nope|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we even are near 45%. Look at the @C.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: playing normal NT range easily end in 2S|pg||
nt|josj: yes but @S 3-2 first...|pg||
nt|josj: interesting|pg||
nt|josj: S has to establish his @S, I think|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|westjava: a strange lead!:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  when pd bid 2@c I assumed W would take some aggressive action (like 4@c) and force NS to play in one of their red suits.|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt in N works|pg||
nt|josj: dd that is :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|westjava: this semi final play 2 x 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, they played 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: NS heading towards slam here so the play might be relevant...|pg||
nt|josj: I think Taufik will win the match for his team if he makes this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might me who don't understand anything here.|pg||
nt|josj:  17 is a big swing to Geo|pg||
nt|josj: 2 overtricks and maybe 3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|josj: except on a @D lead by W (which I expect)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ws 1NT was?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Do u trust ure pard when u play Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: well, W's 1@S kept NS out of their 4-4 fit but 3NT is a safe spot|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|josj: no,  17 is a surprise push|pg||
nt|josj: but still, Taufik has to make; if he goes down, his side loses the lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|josj: in OR, declarer got a club lead and then successfully ran the @HJ which held...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: % for a honor+1 in @C is 16.2. But is it the A or Q now?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: A or J I ment. Sr.|pg||
nt|josj: off we go... (one off, that is)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: Bookmark this for a bit help: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not EW used weak NT before by there card? And now 16 + full X for it?|pg||
nt|josj: but with the @H friendly, 4@S would not have been in any danger|pg||

nt|josj: skipping a board because we are caught up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Are some funny cards for a fight here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael's bid does not thrill W who can guess which minor pd has|pg||
nt|josj: making 4@H is a good result for JB in OR|pg||
nt|josj: it can easily be duplicated here but NS have a lot of losers to cope with|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rodal f: A lucky 3NT stop?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bidding for noe Jos?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 6NT is the best place to be, for various reasons|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: best chance of 12 tricks and least chance of a defensive ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|josj: game depending on the @C break, vul. it's worthwhile to bid it (over 37%)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: 3nt now|pg||
nt|andyv:  W happy to be out of it... does everyone Michael's the E hand with 6@s and 5@c?|pg||
nt|josj: this looks strange|pg||
nt|josj: I think E opened 1NT|pg||
nt|josj: on the expected @H lead, away from the ace or nor|pg||
nt|josj: not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: now 2NT from North presumably|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway 5@D is safe.|pg||
nt|rodal f: for u now Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D was a Flannery variation|pg||
nt|josj: showing 4-5 in majors and a normal opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 1NT rebid now shows 15-17 as NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|josj: seems to be Roland Wald's pet convention :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: what happened in OR? I cannot believe this result...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D and 2@D was inverted minor it seems. I use it when I have 5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: why not?|pg||
nt|josj: like they did in the 1st segment, Tobing-Asbi miss a non-vul. game|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: or 3NT , sorry|pg||
nt|april7: will end up in 3NT and S has to guess everything especially after a @C lead, but W will lead @H mostprobably|pg||
nt|andyv:  just curious if some restrict themselves to only the minor can be longer|pg||
nt|josj: occasionally, you hold a 7-6|pg||
nt|josj: maybe the board is misplaced on the table|pg||
nt|josj: good lead, W will probably settle for 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzhu: rotate board|pg||
nt|josj: as I thought...|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: North held South's hand and West held East's hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: so this is probably going to make at an important stage of this short match|pg||
nt|josj: but even then, it might be difficult to avoid getting a 9th|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|josj: nice X by W|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but those you always know wha to do:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: I just wander where N found his exstra by the bad 14H?|pg||
nt|josj: after the positive response, E immediately went after the aces|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C shows a decent suit and something more than that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|baldjean: which will give declarer a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East must have been quite close to opening 2@C, if that option is available|pg||
nt|josj: to beat this, a quick @H shift is needed|pg||
nt|josj: good lead for the def.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|rodal f: I understand S by the bid. Hard to see the nice fit.|pg||
nt|josj: good they did...|pg||
nt|josj: so they duplicate the 2nd best OR result here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|josj: he was taking an advanced save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H often a easy raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing for EW|pg||
nt|josj: declarer left to his own resources|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  W should duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would 2NT be ower the 2@H?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  by S?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  and EW did bid the slam on board 5|pg||
nt|josj: if NS miss another game, they will lose the lead temporarily|pg||
nt|josj: better not to open W hand|pg||
nt|josj: the last board of this long day brings us a slam off the @S AK|pg||
mb|1C|nt|josj: 2@S is a good final contract though the lucky @D split might produce a second overtrick|pg||
nt|josj: and here they have a chance to turn their advantage into a decent enough win|pg||
nt|josj: they have to be cashed at once, however...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: kind of astonishing N bid only 3S over the transfer. |pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: nor the E hand btw :)|pg||
nt|josj: by staying well on their feet|pg||
mb|3C|nt|baldjean: East will not like this|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't agree by the biddings at non of them.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N alerted multi and E to be killed?|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H looks reasonable enough but might be difficult to handle...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ferlema: sin ser exitista, muy bien Sur y Oeste|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||
nt|josj: I think 1@H is sort of CRASH, showing either reds or blacks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
nt|josj: in OR S opened 1@S so game was inevitable|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: X=3c suppost I presume|pg||
nt|josj: the intervention was slightly mistimed but how could E know?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt even have a double of FIVE spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: support*|pg||
nt|josj: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|josj: but a little ambitious maybe, under 50%|pg||
mb|5D|nt|josj: slam is too high with a probably @D loser and a shaky @S fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||
nt|josj: interesting 4@S bid|pg||
nt|josj: N can see short spades in S' hand now...|pg||

mb|6D|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||

nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
nt|josj: a @C lead certainly is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
