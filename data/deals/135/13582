nt|josj: hi Roland and Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jos, Roland and specs|pg||
nt|rodal f: for      for    * GRR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u feel that WE was a bit lucky here Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: playing Geologi Timah, fro Bandung's Geological Institute|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well I asked for the best line.|pg||
nt|josj: lead a @C raher than a @H from dummy to find out the exact layout|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: not really|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was. Dont play thrumh. Asu said Jos:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: S got what he was looking for|pg||
mb|2C|nt|baldjean: let's see if E/W play garbage stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  should stop at 4@s|pg||
nt|josj: Laksamana is a team from Pekanbaru, not too far away from Batam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhh: ...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|josj: Gabrial is one of the teams representing UI: Universitas Indonesia|pg||
nt|josj: this is in Depok, 40 km S of Jakarta |pg||
nt|rodal f: No comment here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2 and 3 @D my fealing was 4@D from W but he did right by the X.|pg||
nt|rodal f: feeling*|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: apparently they do|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: MGTH means"may good things happen"|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but it always remains to be seen for which side :)|pg||
nt|josj: and a more quiet deal here but 7 tricks are far away for EW, I think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ferlema: este torneo sirve de preparacion para el proximo campeonato sudamericano,,, toda la info click aqui: http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010.htm|pg||
nt|josj: is a grand a good proposition here?|pg||
nt|josj: again trump lead is best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baldjean: the way cards lie even 4 woujld make though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|josj: and this time,the leader has a few of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot I like. Could have been better at an other contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but the contract not really in danger anyway|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: 3@C que by @D|pg||
nt|josj: hi Adi :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  S thankful he has 9 tricks off the top|pg||

nt|ferlema: si quieren ver la lista de participantes en el Campeonato Sudamericano de Parejas click aqui; http://www.confsudbridge.org/torneos/mardelplata2010paranot.htm|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: NO?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|soban: from other semi final GEOLOGI TIMAH leading 30 imps againt BHINEKA (Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Jemmy Bojoh, Leslie Gontha)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why could not N pass for a check at @S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Keng by a good one there|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|josj: this is teams so np |pg||
nt|rodal f: If u don't cover a honor u don't have (the@SQ)|pg||
nt|josj: now he can always ruff a club and throw one on @DK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ferlema: con la linea que esta jugando Esteban hay 10 bazas|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks even|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: ? How could Tobing find that??|pg||
nt|josj: throw the last club and play trumps...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: we saw something like that in the Premier League as well|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: A auto small?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ment the Q@S, but some other chances was there so ok.|pg||
nt|josj: trying to play safe|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|nt|soban: right Josj.|pg||
nt|josj: if either red suit breaks 3-2, there are 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|josj: so a very good contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Nope.|pg||

nt|westjava: 1@C strong hand, 16 up any shape|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|westjava: not sure what was 1@D over 1@C here...maybe majors?|pg||

nt|josj: (plus @DJ singleton)|pg||
nt|josj: and they stayed away, be it not too far...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A very normal contract by 21HPEW it was.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|josj: sure|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|baldjean: 3nt is my prediction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: EW can escape for a tolerable penalty against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: al margen que Norte y Sur tomaron la buena desicion de jugar en el 4/4|pg||
nt|soban: While Denny (Sacul - Franky Karwur, Donny Tuerah memed Hendrawan) play for Syabas Energy fail go to semi final.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weak NT came at 3rd hand again for NS. |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now a very tolerable penalty. D lead best|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's 2nd dbl probably influenced by the vul|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ferlema: el declarante debe tratar de hacer dos bazas de espadas, una de corazon, tres de diamante y cuatro de trebol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ferlema: pequeño error de Norte que debio desbloquear el palo de trebol sirviendo el J|pg||
nt|ferlema: conservqndo una entrada adicional al muerto conservando el @C 10 como entrada|pg||
nt|ferlema: en este caso va a pasar desapercibido|pg||
nt|josj: and this an easy game as well|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|josj: if def. play @H dummy has to ruff with relatively high trumps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't see any possible fun here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have a safe 10er if they play normal.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hT|pc|s5|nt|josj: but now all is set for an easy crossruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|ferlema: algunos IMPs para el equipo Bello|pg||
nt|josj: E can lead trumps twice but still 9 tricks there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|nt|rodal f: OK, but a small would have been better.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  W needed to lead a @d... he's still looking for one|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pg||

nt|rodal f: Any to come from EW?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit nice by % now.|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: 1NT=2/1 it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: even more so after this X|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: well, he might realise that they won't run in OR either...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ferlema: no|pg||
nt|ferlema: que mal|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trèbol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a interesting variant from u Job.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-2 at the odds. 68%|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr tlf. brb|pg||
nt|josj: are we stuck?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: declarer did not believe his luck at trick 1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|josj: there is the losing @H finesse coming up...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT was force for one round and from there the @S was lost. Just the @Cto hit now.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|josj: still possible to make as N should hold 4 @S and thus 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|josj: unblocking @C9 is automatic, we assume :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|josj: rehi|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: should be made now as a @C goes on the @DA|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d does have a shot since a @s will be led... may be time to set up @cs for pitch of @hs (highly unlikely but stranger things have happened)|pg||
nt|josj: cashing out for -1|pg||
nt|josj: if declarer guesses right on the obvious @C return|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Wrong I was. As normal. Might.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ferlema: viendo las cartas se aprecia que Sur siempre iba a perder 3 bazas de espadas y dos de corazon|pg||

mb|3H|nt|josj: nor the E hand btw :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will not like this|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't agree by the biddings at non of them.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N alerted multi and E to be killed?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ferlema: sin ser exitista, muy bien Sur y Oeste|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: X=3c suppost I presume|pg||
nt|josj: the intervention was slightly mistimed but how could E know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt even have a double of FIVE spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: support*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||
nt|josj: well, had the @C been able to run, 3NT would have been a fine shot|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: well done South|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: 6@D would have been excellent at about 90% but neither team attempted it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  now duck @s twice|pg||
nt|andyv:  once|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ferlema: 3 multas|pg||
nt|andyv:  should take this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times some could have been taken. Onse from NS and twice from EW. It cost a bit by miss the alert.|pg||
nt|josj: but not if you throw dummy's @D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: I am still wondering about the scoring of  9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  will cost an imp|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
mc|12|nt|josj: anyway: this is the last board of the 1st quarter. We will go on shortly|pg||
