pc|h7|pc|sT|nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||

nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ferlema: el declarante debe tratar de hacer dos bazas de espadas, una de corazon, tres de diamante y cuatro de trebol|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ferlema: pequeño error de Norte que debio desbloquear el palo de trebol sirviendo el J|pg||
nt|ferlema: conservqndo una entrada adicional al muerto conservando el @C 10 como entrada|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 1NT forcing?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2S = "i mis-sorted my hand"|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or was it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|baldjean: not enough to get them to game, where they belonged|pg||

pc|sA|nt|westjava: both of NS/EW play precision|pg||

nt|baldjean: borderline case to go there or not|pg||
