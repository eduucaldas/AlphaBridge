pc|s8|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||

nt|marcsmith: looking inevitable that NS will bid game and go down here too|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: on h lead, s needs to win, play club to hand and pass diam 9|pg||
mb|2N|nt|woozle: Mahkota misses his chance..a 1S overcall might have struck gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It might have got a heart lead if Asbi had bid 2@S, perhaps better than 2NT|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|8|nt|woozle: defense might switch to hearts anyway|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if diamonds are breaking, it doesn't matter, but if they're not, might E not hold only 3 spades?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: still no cost|pg||

nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: or a fiendish attempt to pick off NS's best fit|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Asbi doubles 3H to get the heart lead|pg||

nt|wygbe1: can w now visualize slam? e bidding very strong|pg||
nt|marcsmith: would 4S? hehe|pg||
nt|marcsmith: think W more likely to pass than bid slam|pg||
nt|woozle: pass is truly dreadful|pg||
nt|marcsmith: Rooney 2-1|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|woozle: it would mean that East's sequence means "if you have four trumps, a singleton and an ace, then I can make a partscore)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: wow|pg||
nt|woozle: Belly offers partner's sequence some respect|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marcsmith: toomuch really as it's a lousy slanm|pg||
nt|woozle: Asbi's double may have helped, underscoring the short hearts|pg||
nt|marcsmith: should have no problem getting spades right tho|pg||
nt|woozle: Not so terrible...If North has the spade king there won't be surprise overruffs|pg||
nt|woozle: Quite good when you look at it that way|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not so great if North has the long spades tho|pg||
nt|wygbe1: west really respected e auction - stronger than jump to 4d over 3c|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: ruff three spades in dummy...if south ruffs in you can hook north's trump honour|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|woozle: I think it's way better than 50% if north has the spade king|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true -- dummy's 8-7 of diamonds are big cards in that scenario|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, given that North is also likely to hold both trump honours too|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't like the diamond play, but it won't cost with north dropping the diamond honour|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed, should have played a club to the ace and a spade|pg||
nt|woozle: just ace of spades, spade ruff looks pretty good|pg||
