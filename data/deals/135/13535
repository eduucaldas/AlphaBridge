pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: He might have indeed ... and it may have got them bidding over 4@H|pg||

nt|bjacobs: GIB makes this by endplaying South ... club to the 9 very late in the day|pg||
nt|itinerant: there seems to be no chance for an end-play to avoid the two club losers|pg||
nt|itinerant: ah!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Eliminate the majors and the diamonds, then run @C7|pg||
nt|itinerant: gee bill, could you have told me that before i annouced it n'exist pas?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|itinerant: simply expecting the CK with south would be enough to try it, no?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you would and you should|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But If North has club king, aren't you just going to look a fool?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|itinerant: it requires split @cJT in addition to @cK with south|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: restricted choice|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|itinerant: so, if you're confident that CK is with south, it's good. if you have no idea about the CK, though, it's a bad idea|pg||
mc|9|nt|bjacobs: I'm with Ed.  Not sure I get the restricted choice argument|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you are going to have to work out the diamonds for one loser|pg||

nt|itinerant: ... give-them-the-lead. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the time that N had the club king, he would go up with it. would be wroing sure, but if eevn one time in a hundred he would, that bends the odds in favor of S having club ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: king|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but N will NEVER go up with club king if he does not have it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so it is a variaion on restricted choice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One time in 100 is too high.  You've eliminated all the other suits.  Even the waiters know to duck the lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|itinerant: loool|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not arguing with tht, but what else do u have to go on|pg||
nt|itinerant: i see what marshall is saying - but i'm sure it has nothing to do with restricted choice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the argument is that with @CJ10x in North, he would play one of them.  Hence he doesn't have either, and you are back to the 50-50 decision|pg||
nt|itinerant: meanwhile, the waiters have served another dish|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all arguments about the dog in the night are about restrcted choice|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|itinerant: all these waiters and dogs have got me confused. I'm ducking off for a panadol. brb|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, once you give a club jack or ten (or both) to South, it is perhaps slightly more likely that NORTH had the @CK|pg||

pc|h8|nt|itinerant: 11 tricks, it suggests|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like the 1H opening at reverse colours|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Note the 2NT bid ... after a direct seat overcall, 1NT would be correct, showing 19-21|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: But in the balancing auction, 1NT = 16-18, 2NT = 19-21|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: Because here, West would have been a bit stuck if partner responded 2 of a minor|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|itinerant: after 1H pass pass double .... pass 2D pass one really doesn't want to jump to 3NT with a 20 count|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: their "inbox" was filled with two hands only - the famous restricted choice (or was it) when they beat 4H by one trick|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: unless you have extra info about lengths around the table, it is typically wrong to lead J from JT and 2 deuces as your spots dont control the late rounds of the suit|pg||
