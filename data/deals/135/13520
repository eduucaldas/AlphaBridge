mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 3@D is not as bold as many may think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction has revealed that partner is caught with a strong-ish balanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not even an invite by North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so West must have quite a few high cards. In other words, Pachtman bid his partner's hand also|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: the pass by north showed a weakish 5 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The one with shape acts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think they can beat 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is an expensive board for Israel no matter what|pg||
nt|roswolf: precisely a wierd double game swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also if Pachtman pulls to 4@D, but not as expensive as a pass would be|pg||
nt|roswolf: as a pes says  the best chance is a lead out of turn|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Kevin and Chris|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||

nt|cicus: unfortunately, the tournament site is in Estonian|pg||
nt|haans: riinu have you anything to tell about system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos10.htm here are the systems :)|pg||
nt|haans: i do not Aces and KINGs only|pg||
nt|chick: do, but I would downgrade for 2 reasons ... 1. 4333  and  2. very poor texture/intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: saw a fantastic segment before this-what hands.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||
nt|lelos: twra mallon 6@d|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Yuval :)  welcome back |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe he was planning to find a 4-3 @s fit|pg||
nt|cicus: X is penalties for me, they may have different agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning Liz|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last time I logged in someone was going for 1700, which turned out to be 800. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks like a similarly dramatic entrance|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is a tight double and requires the club lead to beat it (to get the ruff). South may have meant the double as bid a major.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard to imagine he meant it as penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I see 2 diamonds, a club and a ruff. And the setting trick?|pg||
nt|olson: looks like  470|pg||
nt|loganrun: Sorry - I was looking at a 4 level contract - expecting a 3S bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Paulissen probably contemplating a 4-0 break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Paulissen asked what @c2 meant, explained as even|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And Zack contemplating -470|pg||
nt|olson: if  trumps  4/0  you lose  3d  and a club  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - I was just trying to understand the long pause :)|pg||
nt|olson: always best  to think in doubled  partials  or any other hand :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: If North has the King of hearts and trumps 4-0 appears to be the only concern|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that will help a lot|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Shirley and Ed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|zoh:  5@c gia na bgoyn prepei na paixei to K@c apo to mort|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a 2@s response, 4@s would probably a better final spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not allow the @H bid to deter me from leading my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Panagaki-Virvidakis. They both were 4th and 5th in their groups|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||

nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
nt|othered1: Many play rescue redouble focuses on opener's suit.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow a XX |pg||
nt|sybarra: that comment would be made in jest  since they know how "lucky" it was  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a hand I would say "do not try this at home"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: these are seasoned partnerships  |pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|yuval10: very dangerous to make a balancing when you don't have the other major|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: This should do much better than 3@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 730 better with that lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure a I lead a @S on that auction |pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer now has timing to drive the @D and pull trumps.|pg||
nt|othered1: not to ignore the trick lost in @S, either.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eleni: nice bid from George Loussis|pg||
nt|zlatan: accident...|pg||
nt|eleni: still 5@s can make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: I wonder why east thought south would have relative @S length, requiring that lead.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zoh:  Tora atoy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now draw some trumps|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: need to get the trumps going quickly if any hope to survive|pg||
nt|chick: be fair, not an easy hand for any system|pg||
nt|haans: easy in natural 1@H p p p|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very tempting to take the heart fnesse now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42: then continue @D|pg||
nt|jcone: hello   everybody|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Jimmy, welcome, have some coffee:)|pg||
nt|jcone: tu tu   |pg||
nt|bmkl: Sapounakis -team from Athens- is leading Levi -team from Thessaloniki -|pg||
nt|zlatan: and 6@h is a good contract as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|cicus: can't see this making|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eleni: yes Frank, and I play at least 5 more years than you are:):) as I play since I was 9 years old:)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lelos: trying to give @h count cost a trick|pg||
nt|jcone: pleasure|pg||
nt|sybarra: now W can take the spade finesse with impunity |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Extremely unlucky board for poor Zack - he will feel the bridge gods have turned against him |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: did right in @H but 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|othered1: Play early on here has been rather deliberate.  Not surprising on this hand with so many imps at stake.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I predict that it will be flat|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR (Closed Room) auction, the key was the jump to 3@D, a splinter agreeing @C|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: clearly their accident didnt put them on tilt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: van Prooijen asking for shape|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: it would be nice to have a full explanation of this sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HQ is a very good card, @DQ would not have been. But even then the grand slam is no worse than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: just if I knew....|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If South does not have @HQ, he could have more values in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect they would bid likewise with  AKxxx  Axx  x  Axxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT is clearly not keycard ask|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: 2@c shows 4+@c and 5+@s 10-15 or 6@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: and 2@s showed the spade holding, the rest I don't know|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S!|mb|p|mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||

nt|roswolf: that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so 11 back to Israel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 43 IMPs exchanged in 3 boards! Could be a new world record|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: probably not shown the @hQ|pg||
nt|fann4: You haven't seem some of our matches here in South Africa, Roland:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fann4: Only kidding:)|pg||
mc|13|nt|roswolf: i played in one match where the first 3 boards produced 49 imps with 2 20+'s|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was on the wrong side!!:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any system that uses this many artificial bids and doesn't get you to 7@c needs to be dumped, I got from a spectator. A little harsh but I understand the point|pg||
nt|fann4: I must say I am surprised. I don't know what problems they encountered, but usually Relay systems make light work of these hands.|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: Verhees apologizing that he should have bid the @hQ, thought was asked for @sQ|pg||

nt|ghionis: perdikaris is a fearless player:)|pg||
nt|eleni: they saved the team as they weren't Xed|pg||
nt|piret0: these teams are currently on 4th and 5th position|pg||
nt|cicus: so these are team no 4 and 5?|pg||
nt|piret0: :) |pg||
nt|haans: in Big Clubs wjs aftger openere 1@H rebid|pg||
nt|flash: we're a very small group this set, so pls move down toward the front of the auditorium and feel free to ask questions as we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you said Ed  all the time in the world |pg||
nt|othered1: Greast decision by north, in any case|pg||
nt|yuval10: oh yes he did, sry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eleni: and they didn't get dbld, for -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Started same age then so right u are Eleni:)|pg||

nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|haans: see also this site: http://www.bridge.ee/|pg||
nt|flash: from the Dutch perspective, this is another in a series of 'friendlies' against good opposition|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect E will  kick himeself re that lead |pg||
nt|othered1: Great, rather|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He should take a time out :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lelos: zozis never opens an 11count balanced hand|pg||
nt|haans: according to thats score Starmen is the weaker team|pg||
nt|piret0: today we will braodcast all 8 teams; tomorrow will focus on leaders only|pg||
nt|piret0: Starmen had a bad 2nd round; 1st was great|pg||
nt|haans: is 2@D an opening?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Thanks for the update, Piret|pg||
nt|cicus: starmen has 2 vp's more|pg||
nt|cicus: 221-219 I gather|pg||
nt|haans: yep u rite|pg||
nt|cicus: a strong weak 2 or a light opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Impossible - PASS with that hand. ThatÂ´s like giving the opponent the service in tennis|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: is it the real result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: -1 is the real result, ill change it|pg||
nt|petrosa: ok it is logical|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: N just explained weak|pg||
nt|cicus: W 's X is light but sensible|pg||
nt|haans: 4M soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: he already did :P|pg||
nt|loganrun: East is overjoyed with what happened with his collection|pg||
mb|3D|an|splinter|nt|rodal f: Hard to find3NT as best contract here|pg||
nt|eleni: 22-19 then |pg||
nt|haans: mostly used as splinter|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now all they have to do is bid a Grand - not easy after those first 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: he ll bid 2@d|pg||
nt|haans: then Vahe to weak i think|pg||
nt|flash: Team Orange, the national team, is comprised of 4 pairs; 3 of the pairs will be selected to represent Netherlands in this year's European Championships|pg||
nt|yuval10: so far West had the majority of the points in each board|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cicus: now the task is to apply the brakes in time|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H better game this time|pg||
nt|chick: first someone has to bid hearts, though|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder usually have 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes-S hand did not require balancing but they are daring players dont let a chance go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: lots of tricks in @S |pg||
nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet he plays against experienced players:) George Roussos and Manos Hatzidakis (mathat on BBO)|pg||
nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hitting the deck on 2 @S |pg||
mb|5D|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
nt|haans: south to have opps honors so no slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better write a book about WJS - this is board 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not mean to be critical or double dummy  but from k10xx,  .......|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, with cards lying right, EW can make about 9 tricks in @S, but no way in safely at these colors.|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  see what I know,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Barel has uncovered 3 keycards - can he now find the third round heart control?|pg||
mb|7C|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||
nt|droopy17: gia 1 kato|pg||
nt|eleni: On the final contest 4 teams will plau on knock outs for qualification of 1/2/3/4 places|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tasos:) and welcome|pg||
nt|bmkl: easy game despite duplicate values in @cs|pg||
nt|ghionis: nikos (a very friendly person) always enjoy the game as he does the same with his life|pg||
nt|eleni: unless if we have a surprise:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|flash: coach Anton Maas usually tries to have the pairs play against different opponents and in different team combinations throughout|pg||
nt|othered1: At m atchpoints, I  might reopen with 2@S on east's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: nowaday's approach is to bid games with thin values when red|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: he has never read at least one bridge book but he is excellant card player (and poker too)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friend placement of cards|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice lead by N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: friendly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'Must have play - at worst on a finesse'|pg||
nt|olson: after down 1400   he may think he  needs  to make a grand|pg||
nt|loganrun: This bid has a bit of catch up about it|pg||
nt|loganrun: Sorry Jeff - I typed too slowly|pg||
nt|olson: s could laways have the Spade K which would make it cold |pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: there is chance to make this|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D was kcb|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North will feel bad, when he sees dumnmy|pg||
nt|olson: or be  6214  |pg||
nt|olson: with no H Q |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: a pretty dubious contract:)|pg||
nt|lelos: logiko to gurisma afou o karlaftis eipe 3@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Homeit runned for a push|pg||
nt|lelos: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: and what did 4@D really mean?|pg||
nt|haans: clibs honor + @HK at south can not be a suprise|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is red and imps.....  not as easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: I bet Brink-Drijver would bid 2@s :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: young as they are :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call them "fearless" |pg||
nt|sybarra: they are not 12 you know,  |pg||
nt|yuval10: now @h switch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  To please psrtner, South should overtake and plan @D Queen...|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer know no sane player will lead under Q of trump so he tried the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he also unblocked with the T@s , might be segnificent|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
nt|chick: he won't feel bad for too long, there is simply no place for the losing diamond to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: and fairly seasoned |pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: the needed switch but looking a dummy its easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the face of it 2@S and 2@H can't be avoided|pg||
mc|13|nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
nt|cicus: at first sight N can be squeezed but he discards after dummy|pg||
nt|chick: unless ....  W leads the @D10 and N covers|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S would've play Q@s and @s then declarer win finesse the @c's and play AK@d and T@d discard @h|pg||
nt|olson: 1440  is never a bad score at imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He wll be happy with dummy - predict a quick claim|pg||

nt|vugraphzgr: Quote Verhees: Sorry, too complicated|pg||

nt|fann4: I guess he wanted to quietly defend.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: This 2@S bid must also rank somewhere as one of the lightest vul bids over a strong NT (even in the balancing seat).|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West knows East has at least 12 HCP, so if East bids 3@d now maybe it should show a @s fit (else would have shown @d earlier)|pg||
nt|roswolf: both wests produced the same 2@S bid - i know east is marked with some points but it is not automatic by any means|pg||

nt|olson: his finesse of the H q  in 3s x  is reasonable  and a 4 trick swing when it lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: all roads lead to a likely 11 tricks this time|pg||
nt|zoh:  3NT|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|eleni: only maybe it's too early in the morning for them to put it to action:)|pg||

nt|petrosa: 3@s is forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: yep but long way to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would say and off they go now |pg||
nt|othered1: East's failure to overcall (I wouldn't either) gives NS lots of room to f ind slam.  South has a better than its point count hand opposite M 5-5|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The trouble with the ultra light protection is that partner is marked with a good hand and you will get too high.|pg||

nt|haans: more boring hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: yes it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can West get to 3@C - perhaps by bidding 3@C?|pg||
nt|olson: yes  if the shortness  is known to be diamonds|pg||
nt|olson: or  if  3c  is pass  or correct  if club shortness|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Traditionally the shortage would be in diamonds - and he does not seem to have enough to hope for game opposite a limited opener|pg||

nt|sybarra: just how many?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me 5@S if not DBL|pg||
nt|yuval10: it all sounds to North like S has a singel @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe bids 5 @H "on the way" |pg||
nt|yuval10: in wonder if pass from south over 5@d showed indeed minimal values|pg||
nt|yuval10: *i|pg||
nt|sybarra: or forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Dimos Dionysopoulos is in a jam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would treat 3@D is highly invitational|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S alerted, might show spades and clubs, if so , now possible W will lead a club against a slam|pg||
nt|olson: probably   takes a spade lead  to beat  5c   depends  who declares|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: slam was not easy|pg||
nt|othered1: system didn't allow south to get his @C into the auction, so north is unlikely to find killling lead|pg||
nt|chick: any lead gives a trick, although clubs obviously best|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: room|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is impossible to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|haans: open 1nt pass pass pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a diamond and a switch. |pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|olson: but a trump  is possible to stop  ruffs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not easy for North - perhaps Jansma has evaluated his hand correctly|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nikos intended 3@d as forcing I guess?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D wont catch too much in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: many N players would not bid 1@H after opening 1@C, but select 1NT instead|pg||
nt|zoh:  5@d kako score gia zeygi|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Q: what is the point of doubling 5@C when you already raised|pg||
nt|petrosa: where are the diamonds?|pg||
nt|eleni: quite a friendly lead from Fotis:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Fotis should find the 4@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry about the mistake |pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I win this prize  (for what it is worth)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok- a coke:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: North worried about a trump lead as he does not have entries to continue the attack|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping to mae a ruff. More ammunition for my anti-doubleton-lead campaign|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: I know many north players who wouldnt bid anything |pg||
nt|liarakos: hmm|pg||
nt|lelos: something wrong with bidding proly|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is difficult to find 7-2 fit nowdays|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard (South) is trying to hit the deck!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i think the pass was forcing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: I really like the bid 5 @H |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
nt|loganrun: He needs his partner to have tricks and from his hand a heart looks most promising (as he has spade length) but...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer still needs 7 trump tricks|pg||
nt|olson: still some problems  , cannot pull 3 trumps and  if he does not  N  can ruff the heart trick while he discards  spade|pg||
nt|loganrun: Which adds to the plus of a heart lead - sorry Liz about your campaign|pg||
nt|olson: S needs to avoid  spade K back|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C would have done it :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||
nt|eleni: true, while at the other table Yiangos got a bit chicken|pg||
nt|cicus: E had two chances to bid the suit but failed to find them|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: all moot now, S is signing off in 5|pg||
nt|othered1: will south duck the first @D?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petrosa: so more imps for Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|chick: well, good auction anyway, they found the right spot|pg||
nt|flash: again, many options...   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: including @d7 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has indeed 4th @s and a good spade @s, but XX @d and all other points are garbage|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans: cue in clubs then all easy|pg||
nt|haans: not far fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: it's not unprecedented for declarer to get this right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice duck|pg||
nt|chick: wish my BIL students were here, took me about 3 weeks to convince them to duck the first diamond :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right or wrong, he can say that he thought about it.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I like all the bids except 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps that is why N should "respect" 5 @S    |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt N has a good hand, after 3@S by S has 3 losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C drives them to 6 @S   the club bid may be the one you hate?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That's OK - I am not trying to be elected in the near future :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lelos: my guess is +2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petrosa: N must bid more, with so many@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: And S followed the book.|pg||
nt|flash: :)     perhaps the most straightforward would be to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: 2 leads at the same time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  yes, should trust partner to go with an Ace and King or a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: at this level, yes I think so |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sT|nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, declarer could have afforded to win the first @H, but this is definitely safer|pg||
nt|flash: the alternative would be to play on @Ds; as we can see, that also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: clubs safer after the discard?|pg||
nt|flash: however, the entry situation looks to get quite tangled, if declarer goes after @Ds|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petrosa: he didn't describe his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cicus: over 3@H he was probably obliged to bid his stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: Does ace give them an extra  undertrick?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: not much to play for here|pg||
nt|othered1: win, @S10 and south has to duck again|pg||
nt|chick: only hope now is to drop the @SQ in 2 tricks, which doesn't happen|pg||
nt|chick: right Ed, that works for an extra spade trick, but not an entry|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|chick: although can't argue with success, they *are* in the lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: strong point :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|eleni: a difficult decision for Mrs. Papypari|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: just claim and get it over with|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the helpful lead a 600 is a bad score in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: more to the piont is how can you not lead @C?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I mean, that a declarer playing his sington King - he has NOT 2 or 3 small in the suit. He DREAMS about finding an opponent, who will take the trick|pg||
nt|flash: given the @H lead (and the split of that suit), i'd think that the odds of South having KQx of @Cs are quite slim|pg||
nt|chick: was actually pretty good play by W ... unlucky but he gave himself some chances|pg||
nt|othered1: 16 imps for the 730 on board 2.  EW were doubled making in OR.|pg||
nt|othered1: I really like NS's card so far.|pg||
nt|olson: well , the score is  32/0  so he  is not  complaining|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||
nt|haans: 6 minor|pg||
nt|flash: note that @Ds wouldn't have to be 3-3 for that suit to set up - Hx in either hand would suffice (declarer had all the spots)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Give me that @h suit, and @cKQx and I'd definitely bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 2 was another compression - Israel lost 500 in the other room for 18 imps|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Minors, or strong|nt|petrosa: they will find another slam|pg||
nt|eleni: bad board for E-W if they go up high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S vs 3@H|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4C doubled in the other room on the 1400 here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After the misfit on Board 2, we have the double fit|pg||
nt|loganrun: West thinks he knows what South has|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: a very heavy pass from east|pg||
nt|Gerben42: healthy pass :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly sensible to pass E I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yep|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s is a solid contract, losing 1@s+1@h+1@c|pg||
nt|droopy17: ne|pg||
nt|lelos: :)|pg||
nt|lelos: dificult not impossible|pg||
nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||
nt|liarakos: North opened 1@S|pg||
nt|liarakos: it was easier|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d-1 were played in the open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||
nt|haans: not passing tiome South|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an interesting 2-way opening.  I wonder if NS were parpared for it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't deter S from bidding spades though|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a lot of information and might work out what's going on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew,  that was fairly agressive of S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he passes on a hand where I am sure I would bid :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: West going to bid id slowly to try and stop the save|pg||
nt|loganrun: Kibs saying why not show his majors but Jansma is playing a tactical game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 3@h from S perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||
nt|lelos: 2! gazzili|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@c|pg||
nt|chick: so does West :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know the range for east's opening?|pg||
nt|yuval10: or just 4@s|pg||
nt|val44: 1nt = 18-20 balanced|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mcphee: 2@D some trick bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess 2@C shows a fit|pg||
nt|lelos: dionusopoulos is well trained :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW have 3@S= or +1 and 4@C=|pg||
nt|flash: :)   |pg||
nt|flash: most pairs will have a check-back sequence available here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now North presumably knows partner has minors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should give them a push|pg||
mb|5C|nt|haans: to overtrick NS at or 1 down is good|pg||
mb|d|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||
nt|petrosa: 8+|pg||
nt|haans: and they have @DA and not @CA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: where will this end?|pg||
nt|othered1: Still no certainty from west's perspective that east doesn't have the long @C hand.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lelos: gia pekse|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK Tasos:))|pg||
nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|jcone: makes without a hearts lead   K  will find it though|pg||
nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||
nt|cicus: for what reason?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry, can't tell|pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find for 2@H is that 1@H had been relay|pg||
mb|d|nt|petrosa: 3@D=16-18hcp|pg||
nt|lelos: mistell|pg||
nt|zlatan: he makes with @h lead also|pg||
nt|eleni: @h return?|pg||
nt|haans: screens and online = pressure on|pg||
nt|flash: (some will have both a check-back and a sign-off sequence available)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 2 ended one trick better for E-W in the Open Room|pg||
nt|chick: 5@H ok if he can pick up the @HQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: so he is stuck|pg||
nt|Gerben42: she|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: now an attempt to catch up|pg||
nt|MolvaM: eleni said EW are sweet ladies, so they wont trick us :)|pg||
nt|haans: imps to NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: might make it if the D stays away from the @D suit|pg||
nt|zoh:  2NTkalo symbolaio|pg||
nt|eleni: beware of the sweet ladies:):)|pg||
nt|mcphee: may have been better to pop an honor card from table|pg||
nt|zoh:  :) Sosta Eleni|pg||
nt|jcone: good sacrifice in 5 hearts   not found by Christnitsa|pg||
nt|othered1: north thinking that double might be Lightner?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: they always know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso, by the end of this tournament, Frank will speak Greek:)|pg||
nt|lelos: 50 years ago this would be a passed out board i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't we happy that things have happen at the bridge:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Nickkkkkkkkkkkkkk pls play|pg||
nt|rodal f: The nick name was Nick?:)|pg||
nt|eleni: nickd|pg||
nt|eleni: and yes Frank 12 and a dbltn|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it was 13HP. Later they conted doubbletons etc.|pg||
nt|eleni: remember pls our good old Goren:):)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by that time not with a honor included. It came later.|pg||
nt|eleni: and then Albarran and his 5-cards majors and canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Director called by W for delay by S|pg||
nt|lelos: this is standard for N/S|pg||
nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||
nt|haans: @D right|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: 5 imps to the Dutch :)|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S was allowed to make on Board 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: S left the table to visit the toilet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: or bathroom, whatever is better English :P|pg||
nt|flash: we'd think that North had a plan in mind when he continued with 3@C|pg||
nt|flash: but, having found that the partnership has two 8-card fits, he's apparently thinking of bidding more|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: I expect many players to open the east hand, then hard to stop before 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: @C right|pg||
nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They get 200 here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  But not with this shift|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think the 3 small @Hs and the lack of shortness would deter him, but...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: our E is hoping to win the J in hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petrosa: after this lead he wii not make it|pg||
nt|flash: interesting (and unanticipated)|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  don't want to punish partner for a non-vul intervention|pg||
nt|sybarra: some may consider 2 @H with W hand |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petrosa: without dbl-Mr Karlaftis is afraid?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD|pg||
nt|eleni: was worth the thinking?|pg||
nt|jcone: P misclicked?   now makes |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi tez|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi tez |pg||
nt|tez: hi Bob ve merhaba molvam:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: defense will have a chance later|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now it's just the ruff in @S left for EW|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks on the lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zoh:  Kai tora @d|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome Tez:):) we have been waiting for you:)|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, being 'on air' may add to the anxiety tremendously|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: nothing is easier than errors in defense|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: to get 9 needed deep @D finesse|pg||
nt|haans: lack of entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @D2 is a key card for the late entry to dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: sad |pg||
nt|othered1: another fine result for NS|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eleni: Kalispera Taso|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lelos: Kalispera se olous|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 8a ta perase se ligo, twra den prolavainw|pg||
nt|petrosa: spade ruff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: ta xerw ta score, se ligo 8a ta deite|pg||
nt|lelos: if he ruffs a spade he cant go down|pg||
nt|loganrun: 43 imps on the first 3 boards - NS stopped in 6C in the other room.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They could not find out about the third round heart control, and were not running on adrenalin|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 4 was flat - down to 11 imps a board :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: now @D shift was in order, happy camping for EW now|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|haans: had been my choice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another example - why not duck the @S King???|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Stylish approach is to run @C5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: bidding was not Big Clubs style|pg||
nt|haans: more Acol style|pg||
nt|flash: use it or lose it...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: so N was sleeping and did not notice the small @C or S has the carding wrong:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: now we have an over trick|pg||
nt|zoh:  Afoy den brethike i amyna pire poly kako score o B-N|pg||
nt|eleni: 2|pg||
nt|eleni: good girls:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this means some of the 3NT bidders will make their contract too|pg||
nt|eleni: only on a similar play Murat:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be delighted with 180 myself|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult to play diamonds after east opens 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2min break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that is true, but on the @C play S shows not interest so what is left?|pg||
nt|eleni: you are so right Bob|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but eleni said they all play udca no?|pg||
nt|zoh:  Nai ta koritsia piran 2 poly kala score apo 2 poly kaloys paiktes|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Murat, they do|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||
nt|mcphee: but, crafty E is so proud her 2@D bid worked out so well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: At operating seat, John Manios, new addition to our vugraph team :)|pg||
nt|eleni: mix them up:) but girls never get mixed up:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: right, there are rumors that girls mix men up|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to see that the void was GOLD|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eleni: no swing here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lelos: no entrys for losing d finesse|pg||
nt|flash: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|nt|spyrosm: Geia sou Taso :)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bmkl: looking for @s discards|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Well played - good save against 4 of a major|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Assuming he runs this)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|pg||
mc|10|nt|cuttysark: Still good if he doesn't - but this is even better|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5 imps|pg||
nt|djneill: that was extra risk since if West had a singleton @cJ, East would get back in with the 2nd @h and give a ruff, so nice play|pg||
nt|roswolf: a more gentle board for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|fann4: There's been a lot of action this match. Here's a board to calm things down a bit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt may be more possible now|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks an obvious bid from east now|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: West has just 13 HCP, but a likely source of @c tricks opposite a raise - I think most bid cheapest stoppers up the line here, so East is bidding 3N knowing West has no @d stopper ...|pg||
nt|djneill: I bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s might cash the @D now|pg||

nt|MolvaM: hi john|pg||
nt|eleni: 2 more ladies against our gentlemen:) Hro and Sophie|pg||
nt|jcone: could have been|pg||
nt|liarakos: score is 12-6 for Capa|pg||
nt|lelos: e/w adds 3 more |pg||
nt|cicus: and another slam hand|pg||
nt|haans: slam again|pg||
nt|cicus: EW testing continues|pg||
nt|haans: easy 6@H/nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: players wanted to play 7th, sorry|pg||
nt|hawe45:  night|pg||
nt|haans: hard to duck telling p yes once more|pg||
nt|chick: yes but just luck for them|pg||
nt|loganrun: If clubs are 2 - 2 then 4 of a major will not make - plus the double of 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: u didnt say sweet this time eleni :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: vicious these ones are|pg||
nt|tez: we might see a partscore dbled here|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c..unlimited|pg||
nt|haans: Rummel have a bid???|pg||
nt|chick: lol  np, whatever board they are playing is the one we want to watch :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some battle here - 3 NT against 4 @H X|pg||
nt|haans: rummel what will u bid |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eleni: Murat, ALL Greek ladies are sweet:) no need to say that:)|pg||
nt|tez: i dont agree with dbl|pg||
nt|mcphee: nor do I|pg||
nt|tez: my second choise 1@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unusual bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't N have a clear negX?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ahh ok, I should write it down somewhere|pg||
nt|mcphee: look at that N|pg||
nt|petrosa: trf to @d|pg||
nt|chick: with strong club on your left,  4@H|pg||
nt|haans: my choice|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mcphee: ahhhh|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: sorry, his right :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|MolvaM: does north bid 1@s with that all the time? or only against ladies?|pg||
nt|mcphee: why E failed to bid will will never know|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room 5@d were played for -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: maximum|pg||
nt|haans: 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like support X |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now east alerts and west panics|pg||
nt|Gerben42: oh 1@S was a transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or does it have an other meaning?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Precision-style natural 2@C, articial 2@D enquiry|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|haans: many would have tried it but ...|pg||
nt|chick: not nice to be on lead against a strong NT when you have scattered unsupported honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west has over stated the values of this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: half the fun then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still a peaceful contract|pg||
nt|eleni: by N-S of course:)|pg||
nt|lelos: oops|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: South's X shows @S length|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Jan bid 2 @S or 3 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way he can sit |pg||
mb|3S!|an|short spades|nt|MolvaM: we were expecting something like 3@cXXX|pg||
nt|petrosa: -1|pg||
nt|zlatan: no reopening??|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: no|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have problems unveiling their strength|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems OK 500 insted of &xx-something|pg||
nt|chick: does the X also establish @Cs as a real suit, I wonder|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: East knows that pd never has anything|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2nt did show extra|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6xx|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure last hand was all luck.  EW's funny methods had set NS up for a big fall, but they weren't able to capitalize on it.  Says something about their methods and judgment ...|pg||
nt|othered1: to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees stated X on 3@s would be penalty, v Prooijen wasn't sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from E? I think he have to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: This is the 3th time I operate a match played by them, and in all these matches they frequently fail on their system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 31C denying a 4card major, 3@D general force, I guess|pg||
mb|r|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
nt|chick: I think I would have led a small trump, under the theory that anything else would give away a trick|pg||
nt|haans: many would have lead the single :))|pg||
nt|haans: hard to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  double probably just showing a good hand, not direct penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not so easy to reach 3NT now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "cards" |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "do something smart pard" X |pg||
nt|loganrun: Need to play 3NT and not 5C - this is tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  OH - 5 @C - no make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did it|pg||
nt|flash: North's X apparently shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|loganrun: Well done|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - 3@D asks for a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: Board 4 turned into a 2-IMP gain for Netherlands!!  E-W reached 5@D in the Open Room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had made it more difficult for the declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead would have, but why should north find it, since south didn't really bid @D, just transferred to @H, I think.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Redv=bl presumably 1st round control, so 3NT was easy after all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loganrun: Great lead but for nought|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: W thinking and check CC of NS|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|haans: more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 the 4 spades played from other side,  making 4 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 5imps to Israel on Board 5 where they stopped in 3@C and made 11|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|liarakos: no swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than playing @s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: no clue|pg||
nt|othered1: west still needs to find the winning @D play and I'm not sure low to 10 is the best in a vacuum.  We'll have to see what other information he has at that point.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ghionis: things are going bad for Altinis now|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|jcone: 4 clubs doubled down  a few    Maria=Salvation Army|pg||
nt|eleni: They play behind screens, yet they have 90 minutes for the 10 boards of this session......... though they are pretty behind time|pg||
nt|haans: now a make ruff a clubs|pg||
nt|flash: this appears to depend on an inspired guess in @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: and should now go down 1|pg||
nt|flash: aha - some of you are more awake than i - unless the @DK is dropped, declarer will probably end down 2|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that Jansma is trying to decide whether he needs to lead a @D here|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lelos: 9 easy tricks for a push|pg||
nt|chick: surprised they didn't have a good leadback signal for a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lelos: @s is best now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: could have tried a small club in case @Hs are not running|pg||
pc|c3|nt|droopy17: idio apotelesma|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petrosa: 2 maximum= -1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flash: now Paulissen has two ways to beat this 2...   this is one of them|pg||
nt|flash: either red suit works now |pg||
nt|flash: Paulissen has played J, then T in @Cs, so the layout of that suit should be clear (??)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 5 in as a push - the Open Room might well pass us|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: @S finesse was not best I do not think|pg||

nt|haans: :) still fine  bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Other room - @H-lead and @D-finesse|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt by NORTH|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: (players discussing last board :))|pg||
nt|othered1: west too the "in a vacuum" play for 3 tricks on this holding.  There were other considerations,  however|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet another big hand for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: and west would know that diamonds are her best friend anyway|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|flash: the West hand is a problem for 'standard' bidders|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Championship for this table|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H-3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I hate that west hand for 1N, but need a hep partnership to open otherwise.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|haans: no no sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@c is a good save|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is 3N:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma starts with 1@D in order to have a rebid should partner respond 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this nt is really heavy at the front|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma will discourage a @D continuation (?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not finding his hand attractive |pg||
nt|warrens:  so W has 17+ with a least 5 @S's |pg||
nt|warrens:  nice to have a strong club to get out quickly|pg||
nt|loganrun: This 3NT is going to be hard to beat|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @D position for NT is unlucky for 5@C.  Best spot single dummy is 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: yes he was|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
nt|flash: note the lead of the K - an attempt to hold the lead and let partner tell you what to do next|pg||
nt|flash: so West's cards should be suit preference, with a middle card suggesting a continuation of @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: they seem to play low disc, as paulissen already held the @h4|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if the partnership is on the same wave length|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on 4-3(!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
nt|othered1: And with the right partner you might get there if you can squeeze a 1@H opening out of the west hand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You and I will lead @DA, but only because we can see all 4 hands :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: My money's on @HQ|pg||
nt|loganrun: I must admit that it is way down on the pecking order|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
nt|flash: good shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  I always say: it's ok to think, even if there's nothing to really consider|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it went 2 @C my guess it would go X,  and the doubling would start |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
nt|othered1: Here niether major was ever in play.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not the time to look for overtricks - never give them a second chance|pg||
mc|9|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill: is double by West takeout, cards, or both|pg||
nt|djneill: or penalty|pg||
nt|fann4: This 4@H bid has made life very difficult for EW.|pg||
nt|djneill: I play it mostly takeout|pg||
nt|fann4: Though personally I prefer the 1@H opening in the CR.|pg||
nt|djneill: since everything is forcing, 4@h seems best ;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: North traded on the vul to to do this, and it worked.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|fann4: Good gracious. |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: moving on|pg||
nt|aldek: I've got a glass of tea, and I see a strange contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: hi Thanasi|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: uhh, I would feel terrible in EW shoes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|liarakos: only 3N here|pg||
nt|flash: 5 and 6 in as pushes...   on 6, the Open Room played 4@S - this room ended, a bit strangely, in 4NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After a few boards of respite - back to the cruel deals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees uses a Stop card for alerting :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: brd 4 as i said W did open 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess i know him good enough then :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: KJ@D right cards for S|pg||
nt|warrens:  W must be thinking about 3N or X.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: and lost 4 imps:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: What to bid with East - I think his 2D is correct (suit quality) but 6C is now impossible to reach - (position of QD sort of telegraphed on the opening bid)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 2NT would be a bit of a distortion|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if Jansma cuebids he will surely rebid 3@D, since introducing a new suit generally shows extras|pg||
nt|loganrun: When I say impossible - much more difficult - although Jansma is opposite a partner who made a vul 2 over 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With these 2 nothing is impossible|pg||
mb|3C|an|que|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity we don't know what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess 6@D makes on the same finesse|pg||
nt|loganrun: Yes it does of course|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petrosa: -2 but you never know:)|pg||
nt|haans: assume x was negative |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'll try to find out when I have time|pg||
nt|aldek: club bids were all relays|pg||
nt|aldek: but you need an agreement about the redouble, another relay or a proposition to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: ahh transfer bids:)|pg||
nt|tez: lead directing may be:)|pg||
nt|eleni: how very true Bob:) All of them are Greeks:):)|pg||
nt|haans: pass 6+|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, denying points :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry they won 4imps:)|pg||
mb|4H|an|asking aces|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
nt|flash: if 1@D showed @Hs (as seems likely), South's X probably shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|aldek: you can make 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|aldek: 6 in both spades and diamonds is doomed|pg||
nt|aldek: Kwiecien has a choice, show his diamonds or set spades as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzge: paizoume twra thn 39, meta thn 38 :)|pg||
nt|cicus: bd6 suggested EW were playing natural system but now it seems I was wrong and it's a strong club|pg||
nt|warrens:  avoided taking a unilateral position.  but 5@C will be down 1|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chick: a red flag works too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: only 7 top tricks with poor @C break.  Let's see how declarer attacks the 8th.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Maybe an medieval cannon will do it too|pg||
nt|warrens:  3N would have been down at least 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  North very disciplined not to bid 4@S over the neg X|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S = weak 4@S = firm|pg||
nt|chick: Multumiri, Riinu :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to have been a @C-lead in OR|pg||
nt|chick: always nice to know what's going on besides the bridge :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: it was about bridge:P|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mcphee: poor W now has a problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: no cost as it happens|pg||
nt|eleni: a good save in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes that would have been -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: both rooms were in 6 @S on bd 5|pg||
mb|6D|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @H to beat this?|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, North has shown @H length and South 3-card spt, Jansma will find it|pg||
nt|flash: if, instead, the meaning of the bids is different, there's no particular reason to lead the suit|pg||
nt|aldek: now they will reach a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||
nt|eleni: and a bad X|pg||
nt|bmkl: nice agressive bid by Fotis|pg||
nt|cicus: can't be either (no X from west)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A good shot but only for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: so I am totally in the dark|pg||
nt|haans: this is good bridge Strong clubs and opps bid game|pg||
nt|chick: besides the bidding and play :P|pg||
nt|warrens:  E thinking how to make this assuming the @H K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean off side k of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wait till he finds @C 4/1 |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he's has to assume it's onside and still would have work to do.  of course, here it will be more a matter of not going down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: going to go check on poland match  be back shortly |pg||
nt|warrens:  if the heart K is onside, the best line might be to take an immediate heart finesse, and assuming it works, cash the heart Ace and ruff a heart High|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@H probably kickback - control ask. Otherwise 4@S is a Zia cuebid|pg||
nt|loganrun: I wonder what 4D was?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it is spring - a time for optimism|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|aldek: mam jeszcze troche pracy i wiecej czasu na brydza|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: or E would be bidding @H|pg||
nt|haans: will lose imps here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mcphee: S needs to find a @C now|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this line has the advantage of not needing hearts to break.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anther 5 imps to Israle on Board 6 when the Netherlands 'sacrificed' in 6@D over 5@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: is there anything but bridge?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petrosa: when the two pairs play the same suit, someone is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: about the 6th board:wrong explanations given at the table. not sure of details|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry that there was 3S for a while, it's 5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eleni: yes, but I can not guess what E-W would have done, had Karlaftis bid 6@d|pg||
nt|haans: Trommel do not understand that play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, I see, you were joking with us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: is this real?|pg||
nt|cicus: west ducked @S10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm sorry I lost this game|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem|pg||
nt|haans: not really|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eleni: let's hope Maria Panagaki won't return a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: normal result|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: defence dropped a few tricks here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W refused to lead a @S and now it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bmkl: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|eleni: exactly but I suppose this will be a swing|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||
nt|flash: on Board 7, 3@S was other-sided in the Open Room and came home - 8 more IMPs to Netherlands|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petrosa: now we know who is wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lelos: 3nt by maestro was the one that lured n/s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eleni: Maria is a very sweet lady|pg||
nt|mcphee: once a @H is not played E should have a good idea what is going on|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: misclick|pg||
mc|12|nt|tez: final spot was right after a couple of misbids:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: -2 nv against 3NT vuln is ok|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So after their horrific start they have been fighting back - but that result looks a bit ominous|pg||

nt|eleni: in West|pg||
nt|tez: if one makes a mistake it can be costly but when opps follow suit it can always neutralize|pg||
nt|eleni: at the open table just a 3@c+1|pg||
nt|lelos: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Thanassis:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Last board for today. See you tommorow :)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a lost opp for EW in other room|pg||
nt|petrosa: usally it is not good habit to lead A in no trump without good suit|pg||
nt|ghionis: terrible result i think|pg||
nt|cicus: I apologize for disturbing you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, no way to make it with heart K offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: possible failing slam here|pg||
nt|ghionis: they have to wait for Argyrou result now|pg||
nt|cicus: good result for NS in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcphee: 6@S has a slight chance|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt (@H lead)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Majors|nt|MolvaM: a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed Bod and so did the other table 6@h-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: but any slam should fail|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@S also fails, but it is a better spot than 6@H|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h -4c shd avoid slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||
nt|mcphee: too many controls in s hand|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  they should be in 6, playing Polish club|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3n spade lead down|pg||
nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@c must include 19-20 NT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c 18 19 bal or..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H is puzzling *g|pg||
nt|harmon: shd get to 5h|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Usibg 2@D for majors over 1@C allows you to bis clubs naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: or south is overbidding :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 19 4@H Dbl|pg||
nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Gooed morning everyone |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another splinter, from North this time|pg||
nt|loganrun: South wishing he hadn't opened|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: we've confirmed that 1@D on the last hand was an xfer to @Hs; given Jansma's lead, we'd assume that South's X showed values, not necessarily 3-card @H spt|pg||
nt|othered1: are we into a relay structure?  Can anyone translate?|pg||
nt|aldek: 2@D means hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a good day - playing @S to one looser - we get 110|pg||
nt|aldek: hallo David|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
nt|othered1: has that look to it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't 1@C show 5 spades and 4 minor a while ago?|pg||
nt|loganrun: Double from East? - no|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: That was 2@C|pg||
nt|chick: oh, sorrrryyyy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its interesting to me how often a trump lead against these partscore deals is right--even with a dangerous holding|pg||
nt|aldek: will go down 1 or 2, but both 2@H and 3@D make easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb (old English proverb)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W doesn't want to play game even against 14 from P|pg||
nt|loganrun: What is the Scottish equivalent Liz - does it involve haggis?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
nt|othered1: They do canape with some openers.|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S looks as good a spot as any, especially with the @S pips.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the tradidional play in @s with a small from dummy when W is declarer:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it is simply neutral to lead a trump|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
nt|flash: if anyone can find a link to the N-S convention card, some of these mysteries might be solved   :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very few things involve haggis :) Just as well, really|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks if S plays @sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||
nt|eleni: Let's hope Aris Filios will think of the @c slam|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Animesh:) welcome:)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ty:) sry running late here:)|pg||
nt|eleni: We finally arrived at the last board for this evening@h@h TY all for been here with us, thx George also and thx to our today's operators, Effi+Giannis and of course the Hellenic ...|pg||
nt|eleni: Bridge Federation@h@h|pg||
nt|haans: body wouth a lot|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And now the diamond switch|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what east knows at th is point and why west is thinking? |pg||
nt|othered1: What leeway would west have in an auction like this, unless he feels it has gone off the tracks somewhere?  Or do I totally misunderstand what's been going on here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W cannot play the mathematical correct way (run @s9) because of too few entries|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's not a terrible opening bid, with 4-4 in the Majors - but it is being punished|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2 flat boards on 7&8 - down to a mere 7 imps a board after a flying start|pg||
nt|loganrun: Rise ace and play on clubs - damage control|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spoke too soon - 15 imps to Netherlands on 9 when North was alloed to play 4@H-3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Opened 4@H - good effort IMO|pg||
nt|loganrun: Board 9 - 4H passed out - for another 15 for the Dutch|pg||
nt|loganrun: It certainly worked well on the hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if he rises @DA here East can hold off @CA and he has no quic entry to dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
nt|othered1: of course a @C lead beats slam, no matter how declarer plays trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW are in the best contract|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lelos: another push|pg||
nt|animeshraj: wow!|pg||
nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
nt|othered1: To understand the defense, we need to know what west has shown, it might be very explicit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: west showed 3415|pg||
nt|othered1: any specifics on high cards/controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: with 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: so what would west have been thinking of over 4@S?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no possible entry to N hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for 140|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: If there is any children here. Put them at an other room for some minuts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: He wasn't sure what he did show, dummy explained it to all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But knocking out West's entry was a good shot|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cicus: still a hurdle|pg||
pc|cK|nt|maj_gr:  haha|pg||
nt|cicus: can play west, the overcaller for @DAK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: playing very fast|pg||
nt|haans: odd play in hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a @D-lead would have been no better|pg||
nt|garnetts: good card from East |pg||
pc|cT|nt|flash: good hand for everyone to stretch, refill coffe cup, etc...   |pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: well done Aava|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8612825.stm  for the sad news in case you haven't heard|pg||
nt|loganrun: Yes but the Queen of spades was the entry to the clubs - they work out about the same|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, and I think declarer cannot be blamed, hard to assess chances|pg||
nt|haans: was decided in OR|pg||
nt|warrens:  and N ends up squeezed between @H's and @d's for the overtrick|pg||

nt|chick: being unsure?  :)|pg||

nt|warrens:  2 @S's, 3 @H's, 3@C's and one for the squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 4@H+1 here|pg||
nt|chick: Eksprompt jumped ahead early in this session, and now only 6 boards left for Druva to catch up 20+ IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: an average hand here for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: 87 people died|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Or even as good|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: 1@h 2nt 3@d..|pg||
nt|mcphee: although a chance to make 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: trommel was gambling when he didn't show the hearts though, could easily have gone the other way|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh my west is not up on jacoby at all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the diamond loser could go away if not led|pg||
nt|othered1: friendly enough spot on NS cards, but declarer has to avoid losing too many trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: as here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not getting a @D lead this hand due to the failure to show a @S singleton!!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - so we take the 140|pg||
nt|h_karluk: EW overboard and punished|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sjoert should revise his overcall strategy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Kalita still thinking, what to do|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  4@S and 5@H both down 1|pg||
nt|warrens:  the law in action: 19 trumps and 19 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: @D singleton I mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 layout and not a bright idea for an advance sacrifice on other major when you have forcing defense, say lands into 5@h extremely hard|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: not if @CJ lead is covered|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both players have been warned - two of their kings are worthless|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact N/S here have 10 + 7 HCP - and a game needs around 26|pg||
nt|othered1: 8? a potential baby with bathwater play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: and now????|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East took @H3 as suit preference. Probably intended as count|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should be suit preference if the ace is known to be a singleton - and possibly whenever you are known to have a long suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: uppercut?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: @S8 is enough|pg||
nt|cicus: and it will reveal @S position at the same time|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E plays a very deep game|pg||
nt|haans: but still a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not lost yet.. S is thinking|pg||
nt|haans: we all tend to do than :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MolvaM: so hard to lead from AQ holding but nort could have tried a @s lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The Q@H from east would have been much better from East--clear suit preference |pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: another good score for the president|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|loganrun: Now East must play the ten of clubs then to deny the jack|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|MolvaM: and 5@h now?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what hands, the dealer slightly off colour today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: many open 1NT with the N hand nowadays|pg||
nt|warrens:  cute 1@C in 3rd hand by E at favorable|pg||
nt|loganrun: Jansma showing good discipline and not opening and now he shows his hearts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cicus: as in OR|pg||
nt|flash: 4@C asks partner to xfer to his suit by bidding one under it|pg||
nt|aldek: dutchies stretch to bid on every hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: An unusual treatment -- but it will have disrupted NS |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: I certainly play it as penalty|pg||
nt|haans: good by Kolk to pass 3@C|pg||
nt|haans: when all bid game is rare|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@C was natural, then he should have passed 2@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Obviously policy to protect with any passed hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: what do you bid with east hand?4@c?|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not one of them with a small side doubleton|pg||
nt|haans: wrong hand declaring|pg||
nt|cicus: but N was apparently forced to bid NT anyway|pg||
nt|haans: many say 2@C STAYMAN for ever|pg||
nt|flash: this allows South to protect his tenaces|pg||
nt|flash: a 4@D call would ask opener to bid his major (and tend to deny tenaces)|pg||
nt|aldek: partner is a passed hand, and you are white against red|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: dble very good choice|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this could go for 800|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@C with this nice distribution... dubious|pg||
nt|mcphee: i have no guts to make that sort of weak jump tez|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden 1nt had been natural for 60 years|pg||
nt|haans: with or without 5 cards major|pg||
nt|flash: the @H position (and the @S position) should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|flash: Board 9, which was the beatable 5@C in here, was played in 4@H (!!!) in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: declarer got home with 11 tricks for another 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|warrens:  perfect auction, W got to show a good hand with 5+@D's and 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will make - but likely 200/300 from 1NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: Tihane have hearts control and @C to ruff but p dead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: makes bidding easier|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: only 5 cards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: need to ruff a spade|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: my style is not to even bid micheals with the N hand as it is inbetween good and weak|pg||
nt|haans: one more dim|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT makes because spades break--without looking at all four hands 2@D doubled was a good idea |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|aldek: On 8 Kalita Kotorowicz missed a diamond slam, but still won 16 IMP's|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: poor N is going to be endplayed in @S at some point|pg||
nt|cicus: although I don't like the 5-card M 1NT idea, I must admit it generally works |pg||
nt|flash: Jansma has to play another @D here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|warrens:  it's possible to make 4@S here with 10 facing 9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|warrens:  but he would have to be very careful (play a club to the dummy, then a low spade)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: well get a hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: the defence must be careful tho. the difference between -3 and -4 is sooo great at pairs|pg||
nt|warrens:  or a @D|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry must leave you now! thanks all and see you later:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: well they had a 650 so must beat it 4|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it is not going well so far for the defenders|pg||
nt|haans: but sdade ruff for 2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: seems 4 down|pg||
nt|haans: spade|pg||
nt|haans: a must if p have @CJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|aldek: can claim 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|aldek: more thinking|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|haans: will we see new @H finesse?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: easy defense and 150 for NS|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3 more imps to Netherlands on 12 where NS managed to stop in 3@C and lose only 200|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: now, a @S through will end the deal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: time to trump and play trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d9|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no way to get 2 more for declarer|pg||
nt|mcphee: this would take the pressue off the N hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: So he was doomed anyway - probably had more fun in 3NT|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: clubs are 3-3 np|pg||
nt|djneill: there is risk here too - 3-3 @c just 36% and @d finesse 50%, nominally|pg||
pc|c4|nt|djneill: but the defense still has to make West guess - if South tries to give a @h ruff it is over|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This does not make sense|pg||
nt|djneill: hmm, someone played a high @c, someone a low @c, who is giving count right|pg||

nt|djneill: oh|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: No problem, we will see a claim at some point|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I was dozing - did he really go down?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: good 2@D= in OR thanks to big club|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hard to imagine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: My fault, it went +1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: Makes the protection worse - 5332, empty suit, can't see the point, myself|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: wow 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: card fees paid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats a bold bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, Kevin - easily done, and keeps us on our toes :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: yep any contract that makes is best :)|pg||
nt|cicus: or maybe Polish club|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: the 3@D opening bid in the Open Room pushed West (much) too high...   |pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  2N here probably a 2-way bid or a transfer to 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes it's competitive and less good than 3@c directly|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@C is not polish clubs |pg||
nt|flash: (for newcomers to BBO Vugraph, move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d obviously not steps but waiting <relay> couldn't get the idea of 3@s rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on vugraph its always attractive to bid like that|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make this time |pg||
nt|aldek: 3NT makes, but not easy to bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: 1@H would have been|pg||
nt|cicus: not here|pg||
nt|haans: holy|pg||
nt|cicus: but OR rebid 1@H after the same start|pg||
nt|flash: for those watching on BBO TV, i think you have to go through 'Other Table Results' or some such|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess this needed a diamond lead - does not help my anti-doubleton campaign at all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I particularly detest Jx and 10x.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: @C 3-3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: good lead but they will not be able to prevent the @S ruff on the table without the loss of a trump trick|pg||
nt|cicus: hand getting out of control|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs at its worse|pg||
nt|haans: lead to talk about|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: no breakes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|flash: this appears to be self-inflicted   :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players use 2NT here to distinguish between a good raise to 3@C and a weak one.  also, allows other non-forcing bids at the 3-level|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: a @H shift (and the @C re-entry) will keep down 3 in the picture|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: NS can drop a few tricks on defence and still get a top|pg||
nt|loganrun: Partner must have values for 4H and they figure to be in diamonds given the auction - your non-doubleton leads Liz are good as a  'general' rule but like everything else - you must ...|pg||
nt|loganrun: work out each hand|pg||
nt|loganrun: I agree JX is not a popular lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not sure why his values should be in diamonds - but agree that you should never say 'never' in bridge|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With values in either minor he could bid them en route to 4@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: could he not bid 3@H, choice of contract to the Partner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: opps hold on to diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: E-W kids are playing at Lila's Club this evening and they want to win:) they are from a near by Club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: only +620 was available for NS normally|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow now the big bath for e/w|pg||
nt|haans: a make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|warrens:  W?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: @H4 to show the @C re-entry|pg||
nt|loganrun: They have bid 4S - they figure to have values in spades (although it didn't pan out that way), you have the ace of clubs and West must have club cards (normally) for 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: North asks for a spade but really wnats a heart but cannot know that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at trick two underleading by @d A and trying to subterfuge declarer really tough|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: you can play big club combined with canapé style so that you can bid 1@H with the N  hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  hard to bid @H's after S has bid the suit (1@D showed @h's)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: He has denied 5/5 by bidding 1@S and now 3@H would show 5@S+ 4@H|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcphee: it came back in the form of a natural @S for W|pg||
nt|haans: many use 1@C-1@D-1@H as relay|pg||
nt|cicus: all methods have drawbacks|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H just to much|pg||
nt|chick: yes, NT defense is so much harder when you don't have a suit of your own|pg||
nt|haans: very true|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: two different kinds of NT defense    1. set up your suit and get an entry to it|pg||
nt|haans: at OR west raise 3@H to 4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: well now they know that to bid 4@h is not the way to win|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: 2.  figure out where you will get 5 tricks in highcards|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d9|pc|c8|pg||

nt|roswolf: except on an odd lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|djneill: think only 6 of a red suit by South can make|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes 2 moysian fits|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A little better than 50% as one defender can have @SJ109|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a slow push|pg||

nt|cicus: these -300's don't help Rakvere's case|pg||
nt|haans: suprised the bid it|pg||
nt|chick: I would open S 1N, how about you, Ed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: good 3N for n/s|pg||
nt|cicus: no traps here, an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: EW have a double fit. lets see how high the will go this time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Flat boards - no hope for the traling team|pg||
nt|warrens:  or maybe it would show one last game try with a very good hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bidding to 4@S in OR not standard|pg||
nt|flash: Verhees very active, again, in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: 2@S should be @Ss and a minor, less than an opening bid?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: dbl?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a pen double :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this session started out with a lot of big swings both directions, but then it got much duller  :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably 2@h - 3@c...and then?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They got 3 back on 11 when EW were allowed to play 2@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: he can only ruff his own spade trick|pg||
nt|haans: xx is still not game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22/18 there and supposed to be a partscore for EW, however S has 5/5 M and decent values may push a bit|pg||
nt|loganrun: Can they stay out of slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E should dblle and west can jump around in @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: until 4s at least|pg||
nt|mcphee: why he is going so slow this time is a mystery|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Assuming 2NT is more typically 18-19 North is bound to bat on|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe this is a hand where it is better for South to open 1NT - still difficult to stop|pg||
mb|6N|nt|vugraphzgs: 2 off?|pg||
nt|flash: North's action marginal, but understandable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Jacek would correct to 2@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes he did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 6NT just needs @CA onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: he learns quickly|pg||
nt|mcphee: this time he has a 4@S bid:)|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 6 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: but it was sensible|pg||
nt|flash: far from clear whose deal it was and 5@H could have been right|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s from S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on a good day 4s might even make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|chick: somehow they managed to miss their nice heart fit|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though 1 trick in each suit available|pg||
nt|flash: again, Paulissen's @D2 should have suit preference implications|pg||
nt|flash: one of the issues that seems to have emerged, with these 2-suited opening bids, is that they're used with a very wide range of strengths|pg||
nt|flash: this one, for instance, is a relative monster not vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: non vs vul a lot of pairs play it as 0-10|pg||
nt|flash: here, Jansma has to believe that East holds virtually these exact cards, if they're to beat this 2|pg||
nt|flash: given the @D2, Jan might cringe when he shifts to the @CK|pg||
nt|flash: Open Room has finished the set|pg||
nt|flash: since we got a late start, we'd assume that play will resume quite soon after the end of this set|pg||
nt|flash: if the other tables finish, this table might well not play the remaining boards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: doubleedge sword decision for Sjoert|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a fine judgement by 2N|pg||
nt|loganrun: 33 points - easy for us to see - when your luck is on, the Ace of clubs will be onside|pg||
nt|loganrun: Or JT9 of spades tripleton|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: checkback in action again|pg||
nt|haans: but found godd nt|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: yes was about to comment:)|pg||

nt|mcphee: now reverted|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S sould've bided 4@c|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|warrens:  did S know that N had such a good hand?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: because N can't know after 1@s how strong the 2@h is, if it's only 16 or more|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cicus: going for the ruff, not risking @D finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to find a promising lead from the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: do they have a claiming talk?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: no, E just thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: N did bid 3@c first|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcphee: more @S looked like a better defence|pg||

nt|chick: two more boards for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, and again, today we broadcasted all of the A league teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: tomorrow we'll have three sessions with the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: starting at 9.30 (UTC+2)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought he might play @D hoping to find a spade endplay|pg||
nt|haans: North must have 2 spades|pg||
nt|haans: why did he play the Q|pg||
nt|flash: 8 more IMPs it is|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of the set|pg||
nt|loganrun: Why not 6D?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: we expect some frisky interference |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe not over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow, 3@H i want to try suicide again :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west recovered from his guilt :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @hA lead could be costly|pg||
nt|mcphee: west goes bonkers only every other board:)|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently, it did not happen|pg||
nt|haans: Riinu been a pleasure  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thx, but two more boards to go still :)|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|flash: not the most exciting series of boards we've had the hand generator produce, but some very solid results for the Netherlands pairs|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, a good chance for the Dutch to catch up some imps on that hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo you are absolutely right|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s is pattern bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25 hcp at NS but prospects are bleak|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am sure the Commentator's guide says something sbout sarcasm - 6@H happens to make but no-one should ever bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: play of the cards for overtricks not for IMPs|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure if it gives any indication about strength|pg||
nt|warrens:  For the spectators: these things are always easy to see from here, but harder at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: no denying we have the advantage of seeing all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, if you were 3415 and had 16-17, why wouldn't you just bid 3N over 3@C and discourage partner?|pg||
nt|yuval10: because sometimes P has 5 small @d's or JXXXX and you want him to judge his hand better|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes 5@c makes and 3NT down|pg||
nt|loganrun: Luck is funny thing - it tends to go your way when you are playing well but the reverse is true also|pg||
mb|2N|an|Minors|nt|mcphee: dopi, dble with zero I expcet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: are they on the same wavelength regarding the number of keycards?|pg||
nt|chick: S barely has an opening hand, so will not push, but N might|pg||
nt|haans: kib agree: Sundiszno: nortIf north had @sQxx, he'd have another card left to discard instead of the last spade|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And of course 6@D is every bit as good :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N should go|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcphee: just not the right day for it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: initially north was hoping for a grand|pg||
nt|cicus: as I am told declarer could have ruffed a heart high|pg||
nt|haans: DOPI or DOPE|pg||
nt|chick: this will be a very hard decision for N when it comes around to him|pg||
nt|flash: again, the Dutch pre-empt 1 level higher than the Poles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am sorry 26/14|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Israel has picked up only five swings, but most have been large to very large.|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes slam on a non spade lead, regardless of location of the club K|pg||
nt|warrens:  pitch 2 @S's on clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: gross missunderstanding|pg||
nt|chick: next 'suit' up shows 2 keycards|pg||
nt|chick: although I prefer DEPO above 5 of our suit|pg||
nt|haans: or D = ODD P = EVEN|pg||
nt|chick: on previous hand, a sometime partner of Tihane tells me Tihane showed balanced hand with @c stopper when bidding 1@s, with Tihane, 1@s and 1nt responses to 1@c are reversed; but ...|pg||
nt|chick: the dbl could have confused Dalberg here (probably thought that the system is off)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: other than @S lead, this hand 6@H can be made or @C finesse and ruffing finesse, interesting|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@S probably key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ahh|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it seems his judgement will be rewarded |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 2N probably started a sequence to show no more than a competitive hand.|pg||
nt|loganrun: The Commentator's guide would allow you to say '6H and 6D both make but 6NT looks the sensible alternative'|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Thank you - taking notes :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  no, now I think it was a cue bid, since if key card 5@D would show 2 plus the Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on ruffing @C finesse can pitch @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzgn: yes, that was it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but it wasn't for Tihane|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so difficult not to lead it after pd's 5@h bid|pg||
nt|cicus: lead does not matter here as 2 clubs to lose anyway|pg||
nt|chick: or DOPE as you prefer :)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought maybe it said choose a minor|pg||
nt|loganrun: I have to go now - pleasure as always Liz - thank you to specs for their comments.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Chris - I think this is going to the wire time-wise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Thank you Chris|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: couldhave been, but then he would have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, doesn't even need to ruff it, just give up a club and claim.  S could double for a spade lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: unusual suit combination in clubs where low the Jack is right not the K first|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he missed his chance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: that is true|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|haans: we in Sweden did learn about DOPI 1971 when i was just a beginner|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: E could have bid 5@C maybe|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: smal break|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even @d suit 4-3 would be sufficient to make it against a club lead I guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so a very cruel distribution|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last Mom arrives |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 tops for n/w and one score where pairs might fail in 4@H brought home bye good play from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely this will give n/s a little boost in morale|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have played reasonably well thus far|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: has gone round the world|pg||
nt|chick: DOPI  is really  D0P1  still in use at lower levels|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay let's think about 3@s doubled, possibly NS would cash 3@h+2@c and a @d, so could score 300|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flash: last board coming up; thnx to Erwin, our operator, for a great job|pg||
nt|flash: again, we'll re-start fairly quickly|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: and now 5@d off|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: @D can always be discarded on @HK|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S is normally 3 cards in a minimum balanced hand|pg||

nt|djneill: could North have possible chances with not playing a 2nd trump assuming @c are 5-1?|pg||
nt|djneill: that is the only way not to make this at this point|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems to make -180 is not a good return for e/w|pg||
nt|djneill: West is known to have 3@s-4@h (if West had just 3@h, East would have 4@h but would have responded 1@d not 1@h, showing @h)|pg||

nt|yuval10: last in this session, though we have 20 boards here|pg||
nt|yuval10: (late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however interchange @h Q with @cQ laydown |pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|cuttysark: So it would seem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 1-2 4@H in expect|pg||
nt|wstuart: He had a chance by not playing the @CQ and playing @S ruff, @H ruff - then he just needs to fine the @CT on to make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent operator, Riiun Ots!   Great job, Riinu!|pg||
nt|chick: at NT|pg||

nt|mcphee: 1@S a F NT|pg||
nt|chick: Aitäh kõigile meie jälgijatele. Meeldivate homme uuesti!|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: other room played this out of order - coubtless while waiting for boards|pg||
nt|wstuart: ruff a @D high in the ends which is over ruffed by the A, but he can then take finesse the @C9 from teh remaining J9 to make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mcphee: now if they use ingberman S will bid 2N the start of weakness|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@D is a spread but how easy will it be to bid I wonder|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might have been harder if West had started with 2@H |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgn: yes last one|pg||
nt|haans: at best|pg||
nt|wstuart: The line he played seems to fail on most layouts.|pg||
mb|r|nt|rnmalik: 3 boards have been curtailed?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah, now this could get intersting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: efkoles 4@H apo n/s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cicus: thanks Riinu for doing a nice job|pg||
nt|flash: well-judged by Jansma - West, in the Open Room, bid 3@S in the same auction|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mcphee: usually F 3@C but here N will break the relay and should bid 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C is an odd choice too---4@H   makes it tougher |pg||
nt|wstuart: 1@S must be like a t/o DBL of their @Cs and @Ss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: and thanks for specs for your interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i don't think overcall by N even a close decision, however obviously has some idea there and for sure a matter of style, good luck :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - most people play that over transfer responses. |pg||
nt|wstuart: the DBL of 1@S is likely to show exactly 3@S?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: or 3N as he elected |pg||
nt|mcphee: with that short @C honor I would have tried 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I can't be sure, but it is logically a support double for spades|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, that seems reasonable.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'Unpromising' does not begin to describe this contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|chick: the defense should be able to get 4 spades, 2 clubs, and the @DA for -1|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: S should at least consider passing 2N.  non-vul and 4-suit misfit means hard to set up a long suit for tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: now up to N to try and steal the @D trick|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|haans: not transferring to spade with unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|aldek: after 5@D couldn't check aces |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: I have been corrected :)|pg||
nt|chick: Aitäh kõigile meie jälgijatele. Meeldivate kohtumisteni homme uuesti!|pg||
nt|haans: but it is not common to due nowday 2nt is no game|pg||
nt|chick: understand|pg||
nt|garnetts: WE can consider who is to balme for missing the slam--one choice would be North  maybe 4@S showing a control and great support would easily get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: blame no balme |pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C was intended as natural but it's not clear if they have a firm agreement, the DBL of 2@C is just card showing with nothing else to do, the RDBL of 2@C is pick anything else and ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: the rest is pretty obvious.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A good general principle is that in competitive auctions the third double is always penalty|pg||
nt|wstuart: that's a lot of bidding to wind up in 2@D|pg||
nt|wstuart: That's a good rule of thumb.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: not that it will work in his favor mind you|pg||
nt|eleni: still a sound contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems NS play quite a system with all the artificial bids and transfers. so surprising to have seen them miss a simple major fit on hand  6|pg||
nt|mcphee: he needs to lead @D twice from hand for this plow to have any chance|pg||
nt|cicus: good result here for Rakvere, a double part score|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: non-vul, the risk of not bidding game is much smaller|pg||
nt|othered1: I think this is the last hand of this set.  Thanks much to our operator for the fine presentation.  Thanks to Cornelia and Ralf for their comments. |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: Anyway, hope to see you all again tomorrow :)|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|wstuart: if pard frely proposes @C on this auction when you have made a take double for exactly @D and @H, I don't know how wise it is to RDBL for rescue.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: yes molva that was a strange hand for n/s|pg||
nt|haans: bid less nonvul games in IMP than you do at MP|pg||

nt|vugraphzgs: thnx all, see you in a few mins|pg||
nt|wstuart: If pard had passed the support RDBL of 1@S and then proposed @C later, maybe so, but the free 2@C is pretty suggestive that this is your best place to play, even with a void.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: east has a maximum pass so he must be happy too|pg||
nt|MolvaM: how?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it strikes me that on the last hand 4@S must agree diamonds since North neither opened with a pre-empt not bid spade when it was his first turn |pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR appeared as -100, so 21/19 both nonvul unbalanced layouts not easy to manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: it will depend on the lead|pg||

nt|mcphee: 2@D |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@H|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|aldek: the double was for spades, 1@S bid would deny 4@S|pg||

nt|aldek: very difficult to figure that out|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C..................U@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: I see--well it was not obvious ---but I am not sure that it should not be used to agree @D anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slightly odd decision to avoid the heart fit, but this will work well. May as well win the first spade if North ducks and cash out|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|doks: NS play very solid natural system, EW probably Strong club and beach diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Mind failure to lead a trump cost four tricks eventually|pg||

mb|1H|nt|yuval10: looks like NS will buy the contract here in @d|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3 boards left. This was scheduled to start at 3 hours ago, nay have been a little late, but they are still getting their money's worth|pg||
nt|wstuart: At matchpoints it would have been an interesting decision as to whether to go for the set by winning the @S and playing a @D or deuckiing the @S and taking 4 sure tricks.|pg||

nt|wstuart: I wonder if he is at a min or a max for 2@H after the t/o DBL?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|aldek: look at that 1@S opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: Ah, there we have it; 2@H is a weak raise, as many pairs play it, so he as it a maximum for his 2@H bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: NS have game|pg||
nt|haans: South do not like the bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: The only possible game contract is 4@H !!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wstuart: He will likely accept the game invitation in this case.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|piret0: there are three generations of bridge players Võhandus:-)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: np Kevin, to me you're doing very well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So will South - the Isralei 4@H opener in the other room looks heavy, but worked well opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: no low club lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: W looking to recover|pg||
nt|mcphee: need to grab @H tricks asap|pg||

mb|p|nt|marcvanb: Your chance to play at 't Onstein yourself: Onstein Whitsun Patton Tournament www.onstein.info|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: you are most welcome|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think EW will consider themselves in a force here since they invcited and accepted a game, so will likely have to DBL or bid on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and 3N will make, if he does|pg||
nt|garnetts: This raises technichal agreements here--I would play pass and bid after the redouble as strong--reserving an initial 2@S as a weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: bidding today Open with less than opening and continue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: normal tendancy is to go after @D|pg||
nt|haans: sound like more than 40 hcp in the deck|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If I were Zack I would ahve had enough of being doubled on this set|pg||
nt|wstuart: Given that 4@H isn't likely to be allowed to make, DBL looks like an excellent decision.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yeah  lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: 4@S is neither easy to make nor easy to beat.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If decalrer knew trumps were splitting 2-2 he would feel happier|pg||
nt|wstuart: for sure|pg||
pc|s6|nt|doks: E cant be sure about outcome, but @C K well placed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: Interesting too that the redouble expresses values from East--clearly thinks it releeases him from bidding again after a green third seat opening |pg||
nt|wstuart: ruff and lead the @DK is best?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|wstuart: yep, seems right|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think so|pg||
nt|wstuart: no good answer now from the defense.  Probably try a @H to tap dummy away from the @D threat?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @H return looks best - decalrer can ruff a diamond high, close his esye, draw trump - or try to cut his losses|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, declarer will have to make the final decision on what to play for on the hand then.  3-1 trumps would make him sad if he plays to make.|pg||
nt|wstuart: But 2-2 trumps will give him 4@S-X making|pg||
nt|wstuart: tough decisions all around.|pg||
nt|wstuart: This hand points out that it might be best to reconsider your forcing apss situations after a super-weak (2-6 HCP) response here.  Even though west sort of had a game try opposite ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: a weak raise, it seems like it is resonable to let the play 4@S unmolested if no one really has a DBL.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|aldek: a trump lead would be best for the defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: In my day we called this the lowest ethical bid  (LEB)  where we knew partner might be at it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agreed - never could see the point of doubling for 100 instead of 50|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcphee: Q@C now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thats a bit careless|pg||
nt|mcphee: if declarer ducks Q@C back to @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or the other way round|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
nt|MolvaM: luckily spades break well|pg||

nt|chrisky: kai twra 1H STO 9|pg||

nt|wstuart: he acidly summed up by asking, "Why does the vulnerabilty change the number of tricks you can take?"|pg||
