nt|marlowepi: a friendly 3N|pg||
nt|snorris: this is a ok slam but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if West took the 4@H bid there as the ace|pg||
nt|snorris: a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Player names are all first names as you may have guessed. Surnames are not used much in Iceland. You can see them in the profiles, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: North had a 1@C opener in the other room - quite bold! |pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @ds is resonable|pg||
nt|athene: when south shows a game-forcing spade raise, north will be headed for slam|pg||
nt|snorris: in my methods to strong for 4 @cs|pg||
mb|1C|nt|snorris: south is|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: the problem with "invitational or better" raises is you have to mix game and slam auctions|pg||
nt|athene: and the two are really very different|pg||
mb|1H|nt|snorris: 3@ds : singel?|pg||
nt|athene: not only are the evaluation issues often different, but more importantly, when it comes to bidding games you just want to bash them in and not tell anyone much about the hand, but ...|pg||
nt|athene: if there is a slam about, it pays to be more scientific|pg||
nt|athene: north takes the standard route of not treating a singleton ace as a singleton|pg||
nt|snorris: if south can show his singel @c then all is good|pg||
mb|2H!|an|good 3!D bid|nt|tez: 3@s or 4@s i bet:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|cuttysark: Most like to keep the weak NT up to strneght in third seat  - more likely to be doubled when partner has already passed|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|tez: i belive 3@s shows 3 card support|pg||
nt|snorris: to win 6 @ds|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|snorris: the old Italian style of cue-bidding|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Surnames are not used much in Iceland but you see them in player profiles|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he can escape for 2 down hw will win an imp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland is a country in northern Europe in the North Atlantic Ocean between the rest of Europe and Greenland. It has a population of about 315,000 and a total area of 103,000 km²|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan. The ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: only nation with a 100% record: qualified once and won it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: the play will last two tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: 1. whatever suit east leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E trying to stop a ruff, but if S has a shortness somewhere that maeans his clubs are longer and holding weak clubs E should make a more aggressive lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: 2. a trump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: then claim|pg||
nt|athene: that's assuming east doesn't lead a trump of course :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C!|an|good 2!H|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: even i would not open that S hand at these colors|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|snorris: both will upgrade their 11 hp|pg||

nt|Walddk6: They all bid as if they have something|pg||

nt|snorris: and Toronto|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: yes very bad hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but on this auction i would sure let pd play 1NX with that heart suit in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: like you can't respond 1nt to 1-of-a-suit openers so much|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Karl can make this if he knew the layout, but he won't|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: same bidding other room up to now |pg||
nt|snorris: tempting for north has the ace...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W promoting hand due to heart tenace, but unlikely that any discard from dummy will be useful|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: in case partner passes with a balanced 15/16 and you miss game|pg||
nt|snorris: a @d lead takes a vital entry|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snorris: no...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: good bidding here too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even so, would be undisciplined to continue with 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you lead a diamond as north although Axxx is hardly appealing|pg||
nt|athene: wow, he went for the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: go for gold|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They played this the other way up in the Closed Room after East opened 1NT - should not make any differnece|pg||
nt|tez: very hard to find 3nt in yhis action|pg||
nt|snorris: sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can find out where ace of D is right away, probably, and thus where spade ace rates to be, but still would be unlikely to play for stiff ace|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: west has to put on his magic glasses to win this one now|pg||
nt|athene: if you attack spades with that north hand you are basically playing for your partner to have @SJxxx or so, so you want to unblock|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|snorris: 6 @ds can be won..but declerer has to do a lot of right decisions|pg||
nt|athene: will he bid 2@S now as a good diamond raise?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tez: 2@d |pg||
nt|snorris: let s see|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Slightly odd auction in the other room - hearts never mentioned|pg||
nt|athene: no need to protect the black kings with a 2nt bid as the ND declaration is already taken|pg||
nt|athene: NT declaration|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: in case any specs haven't seen this before - it's a logical bidding idea which doesn't need any special agreement|pg||
nt|athene: north has denied spades so 2@S has to be artificial and the logical meaning is a strong raise for opener's second suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|snorris: and is down in north on a @s lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: south must have ment 3@ds as forcing though it seems strang|pg||
nt|snorris: strange|pg||
nt|athene: south was perhaps worried about the black suits for notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: hmmm dbl then:)|pg||
nt|athene: but with 15 hcp why not just bid 3nt and let partner make it?|pg||
nt|athene: or go down, whatever he prefers|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|snorris: or 2nt if in doubt|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2nt definitely sounds more forward-going than 3@D|pg||
nt|snorris: which north will raise|pg||

nt|snorris: 3@ds showing a 4 card major|pg||
nt|athene: south presumably had higher ambitions if his parttner had a 5-card major|pg||

nt|snorris: just the 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Can't see any way to make this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Karl thinking about which spade to play or did declarer asked for the singleton spade too fast?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whenever I lead from KJ10, declarer has AQ |pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: impossible to say how good, possiblities in every suit|pg||
nt|athene: north is likely to underlead the @CA now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: that's the sort of thing you do|pg||
nt|athene: there is a ruffing finesse set up now in diamonds|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure where the tenth trick came from at the other table|pg||

pc|cA|nt|snorris: now a "safe" play in @ss :)|pg||
nt|athene: tough for declarer to get that one right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Karl is allowed to take his time and plan the defence even if there is a singleton in dummy and declarer has asked for it without hesitation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S played quickly to first trick. might have asked about meaning of crad at trick onme|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: has finger on A@H|pg||
nt|snorris: so younever lead from it..?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all the time :(|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|athene: you might perhaps argue that north would be more likely to lead a club from the ace there, than from the queen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing unethical about that as one spec suggests|pg||
nt|Walddk6: David is too fast|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: It's declarer's duty to pause for a while even if he has his game plan ready|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does not, the defencer can do it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the awkward thing here is that South is discarding his long suit, where he can establish tricks if he gets in|pg||
nt|snorris: seems to hope for 2 @s tricks and a @d finesse|pg||
nt|athene: with the jack in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: leading a club from Qxxx could give a trick whereas Axxx is less likely to|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will play on crossruff lines and likely make that way|pg||
nt|athene: but a club switch was so likely anyway, it was tough|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  may have confused the times a defender pauses and then plays a card in suit which later turns out to be a singleton.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: W can count only 4 tricks for defense, so once club is ducked he should play E for D ten (or any 5 diamonds)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - the defenders began with three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: perhaps east decided south might have led a club at trick 1 from Qxx(x) but not from Axx(x) - plus of course if the queen is onside you do have an extra trick in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now may fail since diamonds establish, so tempted to take spade finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however no trump lead may be a clue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he simply cant handle hand if north has only 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|andyv:  right:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you open the East hand in 3rd seat? I would I must confess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good defensive problem, W will be kicking himself (unless E beats him to it:))|pg||
nt|snorris: new leaders now|pg||
nt|snorris: will he open this west?|pg||

nt|andyv:  of course...it's got extras|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sure - I have spades|pg||

mb|d!|an|minor or strong|nt|snorris: no!!|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!C + Major|nt|marlowepi: one major drawback of weak NT is that you don;t get your suit in|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: 2@h=transfer to 2@s=good 2@s hand|pg||
nt|tez: nice convention|pg||
nt|snorris: would have won if same layout and north with the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W raised on his ruffing powers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S by North..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C is higher than an icelandic volcanic cloud|pg||
nt|snorris: amazing..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|snorris: double would show @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, south thought "they lead a diamond, and pd wins the ace and runs seven clubs and five hearts"|pg||
nt|snorris: Aron seems to be going somewhere..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|snorris: ah..1@h IS @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: only problem with this convention is that opp might dbl for lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not a mainstream takeout double, but it made N-S go overboard|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is obviously t/o of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: May as well be in 3NT as 3@C with this North hand|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|athene: in fact 6@C was an underbid on that logic :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you have a hand i  the minimum opening range quite often the opps play it. if N got to 3N here, failure to open 1D would cost the game|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: And JS on the board at long last|pg||
nt|snorris: thats a shaky contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here we go, south has lots in reserve|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  EW can gain a couple of imps here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here you see that Sævar takes his time although there is a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: some people play after nebulous 1@C - 1red transfer response, that X = @C+other major and cue = @D+other major|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D just choice of games, not promising huge amounts of high card strength|pg||
nt|athene: with a decent hand and  5cards in one major north would just bid game in that major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really handle 4@D cue bid with aron's hand|pg||
nt|athene: so this auction tends to suggest both majors or 4major and longer minor|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: or yes |pg||
nt|snorris: it seems to be norths intention|pg||
nt|athene: current opinion tends to be you devote most of your effort to reaching the right game after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|snorris: to show clubs on the side|pg||
nt|athene: south could have bid 3nt over 3@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the right game is 4@C :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: but i think the norm is for cue to be general t/o and double to show the transfer suit|pg||
nt|snorris: very agressive west after a pass first time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this double is very aggressive, having make a t/o overcall of 1@S - partner has passed twice|pg||
nt|athene: well, he knows he is "protected" by his passed-hand status|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. no matter how often he jumps up and down thereafter he can't have more than about a ten count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: That is normal procedure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: easier just to open it in the first place of course :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sure - but forcing a partner who had passed twice to bid at the 3-level..... not for me (cluck cluck) |pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: perhaps, but East had bid clubs - maybe West thought that with all suits controlled it might be better to lead a trump|pg||

nt|marlowepi: leading a trump?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: 9 counts are opened routinely nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But I agree that it's not suited for a weak 2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a lot of slams....|pg||
nt|athene: from west's point of view, his clubs are only a big worry facing precisely three small|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Just to annoy BBO vugraph commentators|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|tez: 3@h or 2@d?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@H  1@S  ;  3@H   4@H  seems normal, maybe even an immediate 4@H by West|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: ten tricks in spades in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: why - does it stop you from getting too high?|pg||

mb|4N|nt|athene: that seems like a lot|pg||
nt|Walddk6: correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I lie that explanation: 2@c had 'all sorts of meaning' one presumably c20 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: if he learns that east has 5-1-4-3 shape with two aces, the @CA is more likely than the @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Let alone pronounce it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|snorris: thats far to much..|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: 4@cs dening @h cue is good news for east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - no 4@H from East|pg||
nt|athene: do we know the meaning of 3@D? could be a random non-minimum |pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: the go-slow "gizmo" auction has good chance of catching 3N or 4S when they are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is this Gazzilli-like? West showing 16-17+ with hearts and diamonds now? 2@D 8+ hcp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: or just natural?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it takes top experts with cutting-edge technology to wind up in 5D on these cards|pg||
nt|tez: is this 4@h cue or a preference|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the free bid of 2@H is perhaps the most questionable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I thought they played a weak NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Advantages and disadvantages. You don't get anything for nothing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once the first three fail, it's usually all over anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: otherwise things like this can happen|pg||
nt|snorris: yes agree east is rather passive|pg||
nt|athene: double 2nt was a definite possibility|pg||

nt|Walddk6: This is a tough one|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: I guess declarer should be happy that trumps are not 5-0|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and that lava didnt burn his house down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, that reminds me ....|pg||
nt|athene: if you pass, you resign yourself to passing throughout|pg||
nt|snorris: now thats how you should bid... in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk6: @D10 lead would be nice for declarer, and this is not too bad either|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Far away from nine tricks, though|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: OK; to show 15.-17 then, but on general principles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in the bypass camp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I prefer to show the nature of my hand, balanced/unbalanced|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Generally a sound strategy, Roland|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was planning to double if 3@S came round to him but that carries more risk than doubling 2nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Most pairs lack the methods to show 24+ balanced |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: True - but it looks a big position to take.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H=spades|pg||
nt|athene: well the diamonds come in quite nicely|pg||
nt|snorris: no way to avoid 3 nt here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 6@D looks a posibility on this board|pg||
nt|athene: normally you try either a double finesse or ace and another, either of which will work a treat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer in the closed room played for the wrong hand to have a singleton diamond honour|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|athene: started with @DQ from dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoping for East to have the singleton jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|athene: i mean @DQ from south hand?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that does not fit this bidding to play east for singleton|pg||
nt|athene: everyone prefers to pin jacks rather than drop kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@c now?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk6: And our appreciation to Ólöf and her staff in the Icelandic Bridge Federation for setting up a fine show|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N's bidding a bit sterile|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opening 1@C has lost the diamond fit again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N certainly safe as cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sævar can't know that Karl has all those controls, so 4@D now is not clear at all in my view|pg||
nt|snorris: well...|pg||
nt|snorris: I have to take it all back.. it could be avoided|pg||
nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snorris: s is looking for a 1s support with 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: dont get the 3 @c bid though|pg||
nt|dburn: should more or less level the match - maybe a 1 IMP win for Malning|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  finally the support comes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did it anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with the marked diamond posiiton, this has chances |pg||
nt|snorris: yes  a @h lead gives it away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 3@D would presumably be forcing, and in any case could get them too high|pg||
pc|s9|nt|snorris: feks|pg||
nt|snorris: but no north has to fight for it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South's 1@H shows spades - he would double 1@D to show hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all avoidable with the right opening bid :)|pg||
nt|snorris: ah... 1 @d ?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  that's why I think N whould have given a raise over 3@d (that's why I like 4@c)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good 5@c bid|pg||
nt|athene: that @H8 discard might just give the contract|pg||
nt|athene: a bit tough for west, to be fair|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: he is going to get crushed on the play of diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: This is an excellent auction in my opinion|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D and 5@C were key bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it just remains to make it. Muat play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S didn't bid 4@h after N showed a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: still north has to find out|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  in CR, auction went 1@h 2@d and now N jumped to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not want to ruff two clubs as the alternative line. Then you need @DJ to drop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit gives better odds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will survive now, dubious diamond shift|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Much the best line - needs reasonable breaks in the red suit|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|snorris: now north is on top..|pg||
nt|snorris: if he takes the king...|pg||

nt|vugraphzhn: sry|pg||
nt|athene: hello good evening everyone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: I am happy to see Sævar in action. He was my partner when he lived in Denmark. Fine player, nice guy. Give him by best Björgvin, please|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam could be stolen here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even a grand:)|pg||
nt|snorris: hi|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt rebid here shows a solid suit with some outside cards (not strong balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so east will be passing, i imagine, rather than bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: rehi|pg||
nt|snorris: rehi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: sorry about this delay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi Bjorgvin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather attenuated 1@C opener|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: well Erlendur is an agressive bidder|pg||
nt|snorris: a @h fit missed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not a hand I would associate with a 3NT rebid, but they play what they like obviously|pg||
nt|snorris: he has a good hand oposite a running @cs|pg||
nt|athene: slam is possible in hearts or clubs but it's unlikely they will get there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Running scores and standings at   http://www.bridge.is/results/|pg||
nt|athene: ok, very unlikely now :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i might open west 2@C but if you open 1@C you don't really have a rebid other than 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: how about 2 @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can reverse into 2@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|snorris: but then nþs would probably play easy 2 @s|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: you can try something cute in diamonds or spades, but if you have to resort to that, it's nature's way of telling you to open 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what I would do|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: we should play sometime then|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzhn: EW play 15-17 standard |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This wold be easy if the spade finesse worked. As it is, he needs to do something clever in diamonds|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Like persuade a defender tp lead the suit :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Definitely|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: South's hand is very flat, but 2@S worth considering with Kxx in support|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Oh well|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@D as a reverse should be a catch-all; doesn't necessarily show diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however this is an accurate defence |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|snorris: so -1 it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could also be a hand too good for a 3@C rebid with or without 3 hearts|pg||

nt|snorris: 5 @c e-w|pg||
nt|athene: i believe garozzo does that and he has a lot of system there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly Bill|pg||
nt|athene: what i don't like is the "bridge world standard" idea of faking reverses and jump shifts on 3-card suits all the time, but insisting they are "natural"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are not and should be alerted|pg||
nt|athene: it just means you can't bid real 2-suiters easily if partner can't trust your natural bids|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Hello everyone and welcome back to Reykjavík|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cuttysark: I expect this is some sort of pre-empt...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - a good pre-empt in either major. Slam still tough to bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East needs to find out about the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: This is a match from Round 10 (of 11)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: over a Multi many play that 4@C says - 'transfer into your major' and 4! says 'bid your major'|pg||
nt|snorris: even 3 nt|pg||
nt|athene: ok, polemic over :)|pg||
nt|athene: next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, the 2@D reverse may contain diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: dbl shows @s's..2nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|marlowepi: 2H about as high as NS want to go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Responder will ask for clarification after 1@C  1@H  ;  2@D    and   1@C  1@S  ;  2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: useful to play these transfers in competitive auctions (as longa s you remember them)|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s have a good sacrifice in 4 @ds|pg||
mb|2D!|an|gf|nt|marlowepi: though with super friendly layout a game could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And they do the same over their unusual Multi 3@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East sees no reason for the lead to come up to his hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as they give more options: South can show diamonds first, and then support hearts (not here, of course)|pg||
nt|snorris: and 5 @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: on 5@cs|pg||
mb|2N|an|not 4!H or 3!S|nt|marlowepi: perhaps 2N by S would have been a heart raise. otherwise it looks like the obvious value call|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tez: I was afraid of 4@s bid(N)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when E does not neg X, spades are probably not a fatal concern|pg||
nt|snorris: yes west IS agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure why W is thinking. NV opps unlikely to fail by more than one|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: told you so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract appears to have a slight flaw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very sensible this|pg||
nt|athene: north is going very quietly here - no support with three clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even thinking could easily cost a trick in trumps|pg||
nt|snorris: king asks for count?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: y|pg||
nt|athene: he does have a defensive hand though|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: all leads are down 2|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Play will be brief|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: xx9 ace. club to ace then a heart. if W plays low & N reads the long hesitation right, he puts in a spot and then runs diamonds for -1|pg||

nt|marlowepi: all double dummy of course|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d9|nt|athene: ruff the fourth diamond high and finesse against the @H9?|pg||

nt|Walddk6: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/skor/magiccontest.htm  for running scores and standings|pg||
