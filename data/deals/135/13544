mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: there's been an arrowswitch|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|woozle: West takes the quick route to game after a strong raise...with trumps 2-2, the best the defense can do is cash out accurately for making 4|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome |pg||
nt|hoffers: Browne/Burke now only 5vps in front of GL|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: will S superaccept a transfer and reach game|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may have been more effective by bidding 1@s rather than 2...E would have his say and possibly N could have bought the contract for 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugrapha2: No details of the auction. Final contract |pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi John welcome |pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi all; I am John Buchheister from the USA who will help in the commentary this evening, my time|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may see a lead and results while we catch up|pg||
nt|hoffers: If Coles can locate 10 card fit, they may bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: And last board will help|pg||
mb|3H|nt|benjent: Side note - the correct play in the @h suit depends on how many tricks you need to take - if you need 5, as Gumby did, @hA first is correct as David pointed out|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|benjent: if you need 6 tricks, @h to the J is correct (picks up KQx onside with 10x offside)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should be a law against opening that @h suit:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least it may prevent NS from cashing the first 5 @h tricks:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: can't go wrong in the play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nswba.com.au/tourn/res.asp?yr=2010&dir=anc/s3&E=0&R=7&T=R  for standings after round 7|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: But griffiths has a minimum and figures that he's done enough|pg||
nt|woozle: If the defense lead diamonds early, more than enough|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: By the way, interesting 1D opening from Wu...I doubt that's systemic|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|woozle: Peake can switch to a diamond now, but it's too late...probably making 4|pg||
nt|ritong: waiting 15 minutes for pard and watching him wrong guessing can do this to people|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: If you're talking about the slam, at least it was a hand worthy of a 15 minute tank|pg||

nt|olson: 4s for NS  EW took a nice save in 5d  in the open room  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi all:) A bit lat since a friend called me.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W had looks like the saving type|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d is multi... weak in either major|pg||
nt|olson: not clear when partner has  6h  for multi  |pg||
mb|1D|an|11-13 bal or 5+d|nt|andyv:  this one esp. weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @S really from E?|pg||
nt|olson: if  NS reach  4s  W may defend since they have 3 suits  sewn up  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: I know the down under's are fun,  but that is too much fun for me |pg||
nt|benjent: The scores aren't all in yet, but it looks like Gumby-Lazer are only 3 VPs behind 3rd now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Rodal and welcome also David Hoffman|pg||
nt|olson: he may expect  E  to actually have something for the  2d! bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should just bid 4@s (if they can play that)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: and nice to have Catherine on vugraph :)|pg||
nt|hoffers: This match will not be fast, as all are thoughtful before making bids and plays|pg||
nt|andyv:  nope...xfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: w  will be  unhappy when he sees dummy and realizes  E  bid  on  2632 with  2 jacks|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will not be happy with his actions... he really should bid 4N over 4@s to give pd a choice of minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S   is the bigger bid than 4 |pg||
pc|c4|nt|hoffers: In Australia, the ANC (Aust National Chams) is the only event where players represent their state|pg||
nt|hoffers: The top three in this event will represent NSW (the current holders)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there's a faint chance of making this, losing @H @D @C|pg||
nt|hoffers: Board 15 will be a 3imp pickup for GL|pg||
pc|c2|nt|benjent: Yep, at the moment, I have GL hovering between an 18-12 and a 19-11 win|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: best advice I ever got from Zia : think at trick one|pg||
nt|hoffers: Hi all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hoffers: 7 tricks (but could make 8)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bucheister: should be an easy 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems it was |pg||
nt|bucheister: Yes Shirley; 3S is a power bid by N|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|benjent: With the end in sight, every imps is important now for Gumby-Lazer. Impossible, but a @d lead would have been handy for the cause|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a quick 7 tricker?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|olson: maybe  west  should trust  vul opps  and guess that partner  was  having some fun at favorable colors|pg||
nt|benjent: I think McDonald-Walsh are too far behind now to find a big win and a spot on the team|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  this will be a sizeable pick up for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  or maybe a 4 loser hand with favorable vul should just not chance it when opps are likely to have a 10 or 11 card fit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Wu has an awkward hand...I might have started with a strong notrump, but I don't promise that it was working well today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: bets on|pg||
nt|ritong: will he lose a trump?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|woozle: I'm not sold on Wu's double...I don't think that West was going to have a useful hand for hearts after passing over 1D|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|woozle: Apparently Griffiths' 2C was natural...I don't know how many pairs would be confident of that|pg||
nt|ritong: otoh he had redouble available|pg||
nt|woozle: Making six on best play here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not a big fan of redouble in general, but here , the fact that south did not use it tends to "naturalize" @cs|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|woozle: Now Griffiths plays DA, Dto Q, heart to A, run diamonds, run clubs, squeezing East|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: making 6 for a slightly embarassing +4|pg||
mc|11|nt|woozle: actually, maybe not...West can guard hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no he just claimed. not trying the squeeze :(|pg||
nt|woozle: I suppose that West has nothing else to keep|pg||

nt|hoffers: Which made Lazer's spade play unusual|pg||
nt|olson: not sure why w  threw the  k  of  h!|pg||
nt|andyv:  11 imps for NS|pg||
nt|benjent: And well done to them ... McDonald had to knock out the @cA before cashing dummy's @sA to make the extra tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: an almost solid 7 card @H suit|pg||
mb|1C|an|17+ bal or 5 clubs|nt|andyv:  I think he just wanted it to be over|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes David @H indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT pick a minor?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nat resp to the X I feel|pg||
nt|hoffers: Hard to get to 4S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Browne-Burke have finished their match, and with current datums, have lost 12-18 - finishing on 210|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: looks like a 3 nt bid coming up |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Lavings could still bid 3N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Suit surprised me. Minor nt use to be normaly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: north could have had  QJ10  and  allowed  declarer to make now with 1 H  loser ,  w always had a diamond for an exit card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Gumby-Lazer need a 20-10 win to tie for 3rd, and a 21-9 to be 3rd outright. That translates to 19 imps to tie, and 23 for outright 3rd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|olson: w should know his partner was  2632  so he could always win the H king if allowed to and exit a diamond|pg||
nt|hoffers: Congratulations to Courtney/Snow, Peake/Wu and Browne/Burke|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: it*|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR only got to 2@h... NS must play intermediate NT (11-14 or so).|pg||
nt|olson: we knew it was over from seeing norths hand  but he did not see it|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, with a good 11 hcp, N needed to at least invite|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Buchen balanced with 2@D over 2@C in another room, hence that ugly -500|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: I am told by operator,  auction was not quite correctly recorded |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we need not muse about it|pg||
nt|hoffers: 9 tricks (2S, 4H, 2D, 1C)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -2 at worst and no X no trouble|pg||
nt|benjent: I have them at +10ish, so another game swing in could see Gumby-Lazer into the team|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Would u normaly be in 3NT Gary?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably not but pard has X'd and I have values|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Peake, following standard expert practice, bids the opponents' suit that he has a stopper in, not the one he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: redouble = asks nye to bid 2d|pg||
nt|woozle: Nye can murder this with a diamond lead...maybe the redouble suggests it|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hoffers: To make the NSW team, one pair has to record almost a maximum win (and have some luck).|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|olson: a red suit squeeze would work against east if he has H and D length |pg||

pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|cQ|nt|benjent: Yes, Courtney-Snow are miles in front, so that leaves 2 potential spots|pg||
nt|Walddk4: NSW = New South Wales where Sydney is the main city|pg||
nt|benjent: Peake-Wu are playing at the other vugraph table, so we can watch their results closely|pg||

nt|olson: he may think E  had  4h|pg||
nt|benjent: Ooh - nice try by Walsh to back into 4@s. McDonald wasn't buying today|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: either the club or NT slam is a nice result if they can reach it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes having shown min Robert is now big|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: conventional double with one trick?|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|woozle: Wu should act here..,double is possible, but 3D is good too|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: If Peake had a spade stop and great diamonds, he should have done more|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|woozle: Peake's redouble probably shows the spade ace, so that his partner can declare with Qx|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Wu can bid 3NT, but if the defense is sharp he won't enjoy the play|pg||
nt|woozle: or he can bid 4D, but that might be forcing|pg||
nt|woozle: In 3NT, declarer must duck two spades to avoid being beaten straight away when he loses a diamond...and the defense can then switch to hearts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|woozle: Or he can win the third spade, and South can rise with the King of diamonds on the first round to kill the suit|pg||

nt|olson: we knew he had 9 tricks  by finessing the club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|strong bal or 5+ clubs|nt|benjent: There's a dodgy - and not technically making - 3NT for EW here. Can Lazer-Gumby draw first blood?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do they play 'kickback" where 4@S might be the asking bid, so 4N was takens as @S cue?|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hAQxxxx is contagious|pg||
mb|1D|nt|olson: it is unlikely that e  had  5s! and 4h1  from the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 5@h looked like it was from 5 card suit (where's the 4)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the team result showing is of no concern as this is a butler and it only reflects one random result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: CW have had a good set though|pg||
nt|hoffers: Thus, C/W will pick up on the previous board, but not 11imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: They bid all of 1N in the OR with north's hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3not not arlerted but explained as a balanced GF raise|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is a great contract and a surprising one|pg||
nt|othered1: That's really ugly|pg||
nt|olson: agreed |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: its not matchpoints  |pg||
nt|othered1: 41H by south could be in trouble with a @D lead, even though it's not all that likely|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1Nt 6-9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hopeless for NS to defeet this but a IMP can bee gained.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C still +2 I belive|pg||
nt|benjent: Bit short on points and fit, so Lazer would probably have to be the one to push the boat out|pg||
nt|benjent: Vague prospect for making is: @h lead (they break 4-4), so you win the A and take the @d finesse|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  oh well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: after a club lead,  declarer needs to decide if he should finesse the h or the spade  after losing a diamond|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = 4+ and 6+ on cc|pg||
nt|hoffers: The club lead knocks out Paul's only certain entry, so limiting his options in diamonds|pg||
nt|olson: we know to run the spade jack  |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least makes the match much tighter|pg||
nt|benjent: Give Gumby a @d card, and she would have tried 3NT, and it would have then been a goodish contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|olson: yes,  win some lose some :)|pg||
nt|olson: the  reason we all play |pg||
nt|andyv:  and NS should get some imps back as they managed to stay low on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, Jeff|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  not sure if 2@d was a xfer to @hs but appears that way|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hoffers: Lazer has shown invitational values (2C was puppet to 2D)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no but a good amount as the current datum is -440 so currently 9|pg||
nt|olson: the dummy lacks an entry  to the diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: again we must applaud this terrific scoring system|pg||
pc|dA|nt|olson: it could be somekind  of  drury |pg||
nt|benjent: Good technical duck by Lazer - if you have to lose a trick, it's usually better to lose it early. And cutting the opponents' communication is also often a good idea|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Don't he have time for bought of those hooks?|pg||

nt|andyv:  hard to keep 21 point hands down|pg||

pc|h6|nt|hoffers: Failure to cask defensive clubs has now let home the contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: At the OR E came in with 1NT. Then S got it easyer.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Format is Butler Pairs|pg||
nt|andyv:  ill fitting hands make 3N a dubious contract|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is how to get a @H lead |pg||
nt|benjent: Good lead!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hoffers: This could be a dsisaster for EW (draw trumps and play diamonds)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  W not happy to be on lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: or  not |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably - 1 or 2 |pg||
nt|andyv:  4th best might work a bit better here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: And how will E think now?|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, draw trumps means EW can cash @c's - not a total disaster|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hoffers: Tap first|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  declarer might get home by leading @s to board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hoffers: This defence will test Robert|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  he will need to keep @hs for transportation|pg||
nt|hoffers: but now too late|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  @s still work because of the spots|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Match no doubt but IMP there is a chance.|pg||
nt|olson: west's carding might show no  H jack   reverse smith  |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks as if he's planning to finesse for the J@c|pg||
nt|benjent: Looked like a man trying to ruff spades, so Walsh went for "draw trumps"|pg||

nt|rodal f: U are forginen my daugher:)|pg||
nt|hoffers: While the bid (2D) is generally unsound, it does make it difficult for the defence (as shown on this hand)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|rodal f: daughter*|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  6@c looks very reasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hoffers: 3NT can make, but now unlikely to be bid|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|benjent: Sorry, got the contract the wrong way round on 28 - Peake-Wu DEFEATED a poor 6@c, pushing them to an interim 19-11|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hoffers: This wii be a normal result. In the selection event (Butler scoring) there will be little swing at this table|pg||

nt|bucheister: surprised there were no diamond bid by E|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  looks like reverse Kokish|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  North should make this with the clues from the bidding, which will be 6 inps to team 2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|benjent: How can we put this ... NS seem to have been on different wavelengths in the auction|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hoffers: While GL appear to have had the better of the match, it is not showing on the progressive scores|pg||
nt|benjent: A few of the recent scores haven't made their way through to the progressives yet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  they may not promise @d with 1@d|pg||
nt|bucheister: Cannot afford to be stolen blind on these part scores|pg||

pc|h4|nt|andyv:  5N probably pick a slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  club slam a little less than 75%....one of 2 finesses... probably will have to try @h finesse first|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hoffers: At this stage it appears that the top three will make the NSW team|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  Q@d easy lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  or J@d:)|pg||
nt|olson: 6c should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, W should pull trump and finesse @h|pg||
nt|olson: then finesse spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited... squeezes a bit remote|pg||
nt|frankaus: scres collected by way of pick-up-slips so can be delayed|pg||
nt|hoffers: Courtney won Australian championship in 1990 and 1991, Browne in 1980 and 1998, and Peake in 2006|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|benjent: Lazer taking a pretty good stab at this, but I think he's destined to go down with the poor @h break|pg||
nt|hoffers: it will be the first time for Snow, Burke and Wu in the event|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjent: And Hoffers in 2004 :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: scorer is also the director so if ata table giving a ruling  - that can be another reason for the scoring delay|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s9|nt|benjent: Lazer unblocked hoping for 3-2 @h's - which would let him win a hypothetical 3rd round of @h's on the board and set up @s's|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well now you can study the play in 6@H just as Griffiths is doing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@C|pg||
nt|woozle: Wu-Peake did well not to hand over 800 on a platter...but 6C looks like a ton of work EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @SA, @HA, heart ruff - then what ...|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c|pg||
nt|woozle: Peake has found the best start against 6C, attacking Neill's trump length|pg||
nt|ritong: but first trick ruff looks better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: maybe - protecting against the defence being able to cash a spade when in with a late round of clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The only minus to that is that he rather needs entries to dummy.  He cannot touch @DK - that's his final entry|pg||
nt|ritong: his main problem is he tends to place @c A with overcaller|pg||
nt|woozle: spade ruff, heart ace, heart ruff, spade ruff, heart ruff, trumps from the top looks good enough, but you need to play for the club ten doubleton|pg||
nt|woozle: that line finishing with a low club to the jack fails, because you're stuck in dummy if the defense duck|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|ritong: if you decide that north has the @c A, it works|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hello evryone|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: Both pairs at this table running out of boards. 2nd and 3rd only have 2 or 3 boards left to play, and nothing bad has happened to them|pg||

nt|frankaus: a tight match here all but ensurer the 3 leaders will be the team members|pg||

nt|benjent: If one of these pairs is going to sneak into the NSW team, they're going to have to get motoring in a hurry, and under their own power|pg||
