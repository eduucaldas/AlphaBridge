pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzgp: Hard not to go overboard for EW here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Bas.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I guess this is one of the situations where partnership agreement on two-suited overcalls are really important, especially their strength|pg||

nt|fabsayc: insomnia|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has 7 now|pg||
nt|chick: already a good score for NS, even -1 ok|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: they just drew the wrong pards,  e and n should be pards, and S and W  (for the suits they have) |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: this will be a challenge,  not sure I can see 9 tricks  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can find 8   |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2-suits overcalls are recommended for all the time - if you aren't strong enough, opps will play knowing your shape exactly |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but this W hand is bold|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: an easy 2@S to begin the set for EW|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: or maybe only 7 given depending upon what defense does |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont understand this bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Me neither, and I couldn't get an explanation because I'm too far from the table :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: declarer will probably go for the @c's, hoping for AJ or AQ doubleton with S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without trump lead, this contract can hardly be made|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: well 4@S appears to be natural, but i would never dream of offering that bad a suit twice |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yuval10: and the A of @d with N|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but DD always too easy and both rooms took double finesse in @D with above 70% to make|pg||
nt|rhelle: because declarer is likely to run into a @d ruff if the are 4-2|pg||
mb|2S|an|!S + minor|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Well specs, if 2 world-class declarers take the same line, who do you think is right?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: no lebensohl for NS on this auction so 3@H has a wide range|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: always difficult to analyze to type and to read at the same time:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|rhelle: we knew in the previous hand that @ds are 3-3; but if you reject the finesse, they have communication in @s to get 2 @d ruffs|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||

nt|sybarra: mini weak 2  |pg||
nt|yuval10: EW's style is very aggressive, and we had some good examples of it the first 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: I cannot agree Yuval, I play the same weak 2's :) Only problem is I don't have the play to back it up :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i hear Polish commentating here. Bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to Alywn Jihe from China :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Bas, are they using screens?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, they are.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceblue: with a pass hand, i would like to bid 2H|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1@H? interesting choice|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play BlueClub?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I'm not sure, but I doubt it|pg||
nt|iceblue: seems canape style|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: this may play in a quiet 2 @H's |pg||
nt|wstuart: probably so|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: look at it this way  "only 50's" |pg||
nt|wstuart: very unappetizing for either hand to come in with marginal values on a no fit auctino.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not sure where they would play anyway (n/s) |pg||
nt|wstuart: agreed|pg||
nt|wstuart: One of the hardest things to convince some players of is that it is OK to defend if neither partner has a clear bid.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceblue: must be, i bet|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: same final contract as if W had bid 1nt over 1@c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wstuart: "Pass"  it's the green card in the bidding box.  Try it, you might like it...  lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defense has its own pleasures|pg||
nt|sybarra: and at this vulnerability,  you bid likely to be X'd|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, especially at this vul.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|iceblue: else, its hard to understand 1@S PASS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, there cc says Canape openings|pg||
nt|wstuart: But fundamentally, it's a matter of trick taking.  Do you want try and take 6 tricks on defense or 9 tricks on offense?  If no one has  a clear bid, I usually go for teh 6 tricks.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  bidding needs explanation, but final contract is OK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: EW play a pretty complicated system over 1NT openings, but I'm not sure how it exactly works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the main point - it works!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think it is time for a book (in English as well) explaining modern dutch bidding the BD way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has a lot of job to do|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|yuval10: yes, but when you can perhaps write 90 or 120 in the "plus" side , it hurts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceblue: and thats why E passed 1@H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem as long as he plays diamonds before a second round of trumps|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm sure East won't give up so easily|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends on how strong or weak 2nt can be here|pg||
nt|rhelle: sure - normally a sort of Lebensohl variant|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: so either weak, or denies (or shows, depending on agreement) a ! s stop and GF|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with or without bidding of NS EW do reach the normal 4nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yuval10: 2@h suppose to be good raise with 8+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E asking for minor |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now it´s easy to find @cQ in 6@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many @s's now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s I think:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Just because I'm paranoid it doesn't mean that they are not all out to get me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: You have no idea.... *grin*|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  this hope this is a @H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Yes, solid theory to play the 3NT bid as art on this auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but Bob the movie still reads -2, please correct|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||
nt|chick: I don't think E has enough controls to carry on to 6, but N might push him to it with 5@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: who's thinking now, i wonder|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably East|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and we can find that with our cuebids - no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator will get it fixed |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  one more example of BD system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: This could be regular Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: And Drijver figuring out how high he should bid|pg||
nt|wstuart: Tough decision for west there|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@d will go down 1, the defence isn't suppose to be any difficult|pg||

nt|yuval10: i don't think he'll sell out so quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H maybe then  to keep it going |pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 6 @D with the right guesses |pg||
nt|yuval10: the 2 pairs from Israel in this tournement will both represent Israel in the upcomming European championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|sybarra: would 3 @D be forcing  I am not sure of their system |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 5-4 with such reverse - is OK|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceblue: 2@D shows 4+cards @S|pg||
nt|frankaus: ah drury i'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: along with a 3rd pair, Ilan and Ofir Herbst|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok quanti,  (I should stick with first thought) |pg||
nt|yuval10: W has a minimum, i'm not sure he'd like his KJ doubleton @h either, and his 5 cards suit isn't too good either|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to the studio Andy :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  moreover, several pairs (playing non-forcing stayman) have agreement that 1NT opening promises at least 3-2 in majors|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S=light opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, the 5th @H made him wonder.  Had @H been 3-0 4@S was making.  5H was not such a bad decision, though it is likely to cost them at least 5 IMPs./|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 2@S is a trap, as really there is no sound game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, I've got the cc here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: pass is very reasonable , unlucky that it all breaks so well|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt is logical place to play |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days (many for me) it doesnt break this well |pg||
nt|sybarra: the minor suit breaks make this hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  gm everyone|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3-0 @H will happen 22% of the time, a priori, perhaps more when you consider that they freely chose to bid 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

nt|mcphee: must be 6 card key card|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|imp_jan: but what can he do, he is not the captain of the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  asking for 2nd rd control?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @C2 for a @D return, I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or at least showing @D values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W has to be brave enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  underlead his @d ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @DA-@Dx works as well, no?|pg||
nt|chick: even if low is correct, there are two entries to dummy, so cannot stop him using the spades|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@C is likely to be 2 way checkback here; it forces 2@D which can either be passed, as on this hand, or another bid can be made which is natural and invitational.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

mb|2C|nt|andyv:  all games for EW seemed doomed|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 4@s has the best shot|pg||
nt|mcphee: when S does not win the K@D in the eventual 3N west is going to have to guess well|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am assuming N will not discover the killing A@C lead to 3N:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: hehe|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S looks to be the spot here|pg||
nt|aldek: Michal wyraznie zmeczony, w pierwszym rozdaniu tez przegral koncowke|pg||

nt|iceblue: DO NS play polish club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, they do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But the duck in @s forced S to use an entry to the table and there was no endplay but a guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: where do we want to play now? |pg||
nt|andyv:  W does have a hand... may not be expecting that light of hand from E|pg||
nt|frankaus: is the pope catholic :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Kalita shaking his head as he passed :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: must be, S would dble if play STR 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: that is true, but I think this must be 3N not 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Jansma: "If this goes down I'll buy you a drink" to Paulissen|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcphee: likely @S lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: remember brd 2, where @CQ shld have ducked by decl?|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead certainly doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it will all come down to the @D suit in any case|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the other match barel ducked indeed!|pg||
nt|mcphee: looking like 2-4 leads for the Poles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Only vs NT, vs suit they lead odd|pg||
nt|imp_jan: though in the middle of the game, decl got a spade lead, and eventually made 4@H dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or so it seems from previous boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: is this really 4N Bas?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sybarra: these are challenging hands!!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like "doping", no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I'm thinking 1@D Walsh, 1@H unbalanced and 1@S fsf is too easy an explanation, haha|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think we are seeing a lot of switched rebids much like Meckwell use|pg||
nt|frankaus: this willl not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: although 1 or 2 hts might play better |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx for fix |pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry it took so long ; )|pg||
nt|wstuart: This reminds me of the old description of an early IBM operating system, VM:  " It may be slow, but at least it's hard to use."  Here their bidding makes me think, "I may not have ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: a good hand, but at least you don't know what my distribution is."|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes possible for players playing natural, 1@C-1@H-1@S-2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am sure he will not take K@D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yuval10: probably 3NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: the players when the other side bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: that is giving up|pg||

nt|frankaus: trying for short @C K|pg||

nt|andyv:  with vul, W has to invite|pg||
nt|mcphee: only see 8|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@H is the best?|pg||
nt|fann4: A light overcall by E, vul too, but the 5431 shape and @DK make it better|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: I think the fact that Pachtman had already passed was important in Ginossar's decision to pass 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: W also did very well here to bid only 3@s, knowing that he has a very good def. against 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C can be weak from Pachtman? the auction suggests otherwise|pg||

nt|andyv:  now is time for Bos's 6@c:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps W is trying to catch up after his 3N disaster|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Andy:)\|pg||
nt|fann4: Looks like a vul game missed. Even on the trump lead it can make'|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this looks like nothing special either way |pg||
nt|rnmalik: a flat board to end the segment. Thanks all.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zbig1959:  uff, pare impow dla nas:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Only on special occasions :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by spec that cashing ht, king, then ak of clubs, exiting a @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be easier to see from here than at the table however |pg||
nt|sybarra: cash ace of hts while in dummy maybe also |pg||
nt|rnmalik: then no entry to go to the hand-imo small @C to 9, would ensure 10 tricks even if AK@D are cashed.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: Why not finess in @c?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcphee: wait, W can pass now the K@C is shown:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  perfect auction!|pg||
nt|sybarra: ride the 7 of clubs around now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 9|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  dobre i 9, pozostanie do odronienia 12|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  too bad N is on lead (for EW)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead (esp. after 4@d bid by W) should stand out|pg||
nt|mcphee: E is going to be sad when he views the trumps, :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, could be 2 in the glue|pg||
nt|mcphee: or more if E tries some safety play in trumps|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh W is on play|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: No joke :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: well who else got the lead wrong?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  lead doesn't make sense but I've never been very good at them anyway|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose as no dble of 6@C that is why he led a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  this might force E to make it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: S just went to the bathroom :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hee hee|pg||
nt|mcphee: brb,= bath room break|pg||
nt|andyv:  but I would still bet against the slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will give you odds it fails:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: how does around 5 to 1 sound?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Board five, where W went 5 off in a 4NT was played in the OR as 3NT +3 :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ruff D, back with A@h, ruff @d, float q@h and then guess @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much to do:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: not happening Andy:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  if E cashes @h and plays @d he promotes one more trump trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  w is mature enough for no-ruff in such position|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Sorry trying missed some things|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: -trying|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcphee: take the @D tap and now its a trump|pg||
nt|Gerben42: can endplay Drijver here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what is the best next move for S? hard to imagine|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exiting with @h?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: before playing @h|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: Q|pg||
nt|andyv:  no imagination|pg||
nt|mcphee: none:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but practical:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is going to be another punch in @D when the hook loses as well|pg||
nt|mcphee: definetly 2 down|pg||
nt|andyv:  can still make:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: how aboaut 6 to 1?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but will need a little help from the defense|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  ok, all bets are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Think I got it now, apologies|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np|pg||
nt|sybarra: np |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry but too slow.:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: West has gotten to the point of sitting on 2 legs and blowing bubbles with his gum|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: N is thinking...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: even had N split his trumps it was going down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: exiting with @H would have been best, yes, as he would be entitled to another trick in that case|pg||
pc|d3|mc|11|nt|aldek: nie ma na czym|pg||
nt|aldek: zegnam kolegow, do nastepnego|pg||
