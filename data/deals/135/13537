nt|janm: And of course 2@h is pass if you have hearts, bid 2@s if you have spades - I guess if you open weak 2's as aggressively as West does, you don't go to the 3-level with East's hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|janm: Should make exactly 2, as long as he can hold his losers to the obvious 2 spades, 1 heart & 2 diamonds - he can surely take 4 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|janm: And now West's pass shows that he didn't have extra values for his opening bid. I suspect that E's DBL was cooperative, suggesting that he did have some extras|pg||

nt|janm: this hand where EW had most of their values in the pointed suits and NS in the rounded ones, so "the law" was wrong|pg||
