mb|2D!|nt|jaapfr: here in CR opps imo lost 2@D 1@C and 1@S so amazed to see scoring of 4@H C (but commentating there in Polish so i was lost:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: There are two matches going on, so the score and the tricks lost may come from two different tables.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: play went @H to J @D to QK and @H return and went on to lose 4 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Netherlands-Poland match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my face now very red i was directed to Poland open:( sorry gentlemen|pg||
nt|jwit: No problem Jaap|pg||
nt|brolucius: I work on the assumption that all commentators are allowed two mistakes per session. If that wasn't true, I would not be here now.|pg||
nt|jwit: Even with a heart lead, declarer can make by disdaining the diamond finesse, though the percentages for that play are not very good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgr: Louk explained north has 0-4 with a lot of spades south 45 red either way....|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Kevin and Chris|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||

nt|haans: i do not Aces and KINGs only|pg||
nt|chick: do, but I would downgrade for 2 reasons ... 1. 4333  and  2. very poor texture/intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: saw a fantastic segment before this-what hands.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||

nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||

nt|cicus: X is penalties for me, they may have different agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Morning Liz|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last time I logged in someone was going for 1700, which turned out to be 800. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks like a similarly dramatic entrance|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is a tight double and requires the club lead to beat it (to get the ruff). South may have meant the double as bid a major.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hard to imagine he meant it as penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I see 2 diamonds, a club and a ruff. And the setting trick?|pg||
nt|olson: looks like  470|pg||
nt|loganrun: Sorry - I was looking at a 4 level contract - expecting a 3S bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Paulissen probably contemplating a 4-0 break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Paulissen asked what @c2 meant, explained as even|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And Zack contemplating -470|pg||
nt|olson: if  trumps  4/0  you lose  3d  and a club  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - I was just trying to understand the long pause :)|pg||
nt|olson: always best  to think in doubled  partials  or any other hand :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: If North has the King of hearts and trumps 4-0 appears to be the only concern|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that will help a lot|pg||

nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Panagaki-Virvidakis. They both were 4th and 5th in their groups|pg||

pc|c8|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||

nt|othered1: Anayone know what system EW plays?|pg||

nt|othered1: vul before bidding 3@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: yes|pg||

nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||

nt|sybarra: that comment would be made in jest  since they know how "lucky" it was  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||

nt|sybarra: lebish |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ghionis: 1st swing here i think|pg||
nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
nt|othered1: note that south picked his better red suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's 1NT actually helped EW to get to a better contract|pg||
nt|loganrun: Jansma debating about doubling and does so|pg||
nt|sybarra: my question also |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a hand I would say "do not try this at home"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: these are seasoned partnerships  |pg||
nt|othered1: south has a decision here?  I'd love to have this hand when partner bids @S into the opening bidder.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with Dbl from N in vul. Anyone else?|pg||
nt|sommer: .. it was|pg||
nt|sommer: I do:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree also,  dont want to lose the @H suit |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|yuval10: very dangerous to make a balancing when you don't have the other major|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East will be overjoyed - 'You are on our own'|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H may have been 4 @H|pg||
nt|haans: 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: This should do much better than 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 730 better with that lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure a I lead a @S on that auction |pg||
nt|othered1: I think declarer now has timing to drive the @D and pull trumps.|pg||
nt|othered1: not to ignore the trick lost in @S, either.|pg||
nt|sommer: 3@H-1 may turn out flat with 2@S=|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but who says that we have a @h suit together to find on the 3-level?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but S haven't 8 tricks for sure....|pg||
nt|sybarra: if playing leb,  I think you can find safety on 3 level |pg||

pc|d3|nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Extremely unlucky board for poor Zack - he will feel the bridge gods have turned against him |pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: did right in @H but 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|othered1: Play early on here has been rather deliberate.  Not surprising on this hand with so many imps at stake.|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: 3 board per round, 8 rounds 24 boards|pg||

nt|brolucius: 32 points is normally thought of as a point or two light for 6NT, when no long suit is present.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East knows he is facing a passed hand, so will probably not go to a slam.|pg||
nt|jwit: Without help from the defense, 6NT appears to be a trick light, unless declarer can guess the diamond suit|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: let's hope that West goes to 6NT now, so we can watch the play with interest.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He has drab shape and has already suggested 11 points with his jump. Oh, great! He has taken pity on us and bid it.|pg||
nt|jwit: He will have to be a real magician with the 1D opening bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boldly bid by E/W.|pg||
nt|jwit: Will probably lead a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may lead a diamond.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade is not completely safe.|pg||
nt|jwit: No, but looks safer than a diamond|pg||
nt|brolucius: A heart or a club would be a poor choice. You must look for a safe lead against 6NT.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Leading from an honour costs around half a trick on average. Worth it from a five-carder against 3NT. I can barely believe that such a good played has led a club against 6NT. |pg||
nt|jwit: What do we know David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has obviously not read my '52 Great Tips' book...|pg||
nt|jwit: A club would be my last lead from that hand on this auction|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|jwit: But on the actual hand, it is brilliant|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: The point is that it is worth sacrificing the average half a trick by leading from an honor when you have some prospect of setting up long cards against 3NT. Not worth the risk at ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: all when you are defending 6NT.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can pick up @DJ-9-x-x with North, if he chooses to believe that the psyche was on diamond length.|pg||

nt|brolucius: South discarded a diamond at the other table.|pg||

pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jwit: No way is that going to happen here.  In fact, the unlikely club lead made sure South would not have discarding problems|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they make 6NT here, after the 1@D opening, they can be well pleased with their efforts. I will be impressed too.|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer still will have a tough time believing North lead from Qxxx|pg||
nt|jwit: More likely from 9xx|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North began with four diamonds and four clubs, he would be squeezed by the last spade.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We are so lucky that they bid 6NT, because it gives us some interesting play to watch.|pg||

nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hitting the deck on 2 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: E has max.. so|pg||
nt|sommer: 5NT may be "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|sybarra: W may pass given the 4333  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I need somthing more from you....:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh well,  see what I know,  |pg||
nt|sommer: ..W has 2 tens!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion W has 4333 when not asking for distribution|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh good!|pg||
nt|sommer: ..yes, but the 4c MIGHT be @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: my best is still on the pass |pg||
mb|6N|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||

nt|sybarra: *bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||

pc|s5|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Warren Spector |pg||
nt|yuval10: the dutch trails consisted of weekend sessions, in which EW won 1st place in, a training match against Russia. 1 or 2 weeks ago, and the current match vs Israel and Poland|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|chick: true, he would have to depend on the @H finesse then|pg||

nt|chick: but if he draws trump loses another club instead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||

nt|olson: yes,  minus  470  and 1400  had a bad feel to them  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Paulissen hoping to hear 3NT, which he just might double|pg||
nt|sommer: it wasn't that way, I said, S would follow to @D4 with the 9:))|pg||

nt|petrosa: 3@s is forcing?|pg||
nt|haans: yep but long way to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would say and off they go now |pg||
nt|othered1: East's failure to overcall (I wouldn't either) gives NS lots of room to f ind slam.  South has a better than its point count hand opposite M 5-5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|mcphee: no reason for E to get excited with a flat 11|pg||

nt|sommer: this is very difficult to make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flash: E-W don't seem to have gotten a good grip on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@S a nice bid by south, getting things solidly set for slam investigation|pg||
nt|chick: taking S a long time to bid 5@C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: The trouble with the ultra light protection is that partner is marked with a good hand and you will get too high.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Trading a minus score for a plus, and upsetting partner at the same time|pg||
pc|c6|nt|droopy17: prin ypirhe o kindynos sta spathia|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: Group A after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|eleni: Nick thinks and thinks forever:)|pg||
nt|petrosa: firstly nonforcing bid and then slam|pg||
nt|eleni: a sound slam for E-W|pg||
nt|cicus: well if they have a 2-way checkback method (2@C for invites, 2@D for game force)|pg||
nt|cicus: then 3@S shows good spades but not forcing|pg||
nt|haans: i did once find 5@C bid 3@C prempt fooling opps to bid once more then 4@S from me corrected|pg||
nt|sybarra: glad you can join,  as I have have leave given business/lunch schedule |pg||

nt|haans: x by North now say @DK is North|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Shirley!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|loganrun: When East takes no action over 1NT, he sometimes has the hand he has - a willingness to defend - rather than a balanced hand with no good bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: N needs to hold onto the 4th @S|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East is no doubt naming the @DK in response to 5NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a more popular method of responding nowadays than giving a count on your kings.|pg||
nt|jwit: If they have it available, West may now bid 6H as a last train|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||

nt|haans: more boring hand|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Can West get to 3@C - perhaps by bidding 3@C?|pg||
nt|olson: yes  if the shortness  is known to be diamonds|pg||
nt|olson: or  if  3c  is pass  or correct  if club shortness|pg||

nt|ghionis: missed the game here|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H easy now|pg||
nt|haans: sad|pg||
nt|sybarra: a club system, refined by them |pg||
mb|4C|an|splinter|nt|zoh:  Xathikan oi @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: N is now up against it|pg||
nt|mcphee: is S is going to bid 3@D no reason why he should not take time out to tell about @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe west should have just bid 5@c and leave them alone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: someone should bid @S or you will not play them|pg||
nt|MolvaM: was 3@d forcing?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so far all the bidding has not excited the S hand|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@dx-1 was the contract in the open roon on board 5|pg||
nt|liarakos: to 2H den itan forcing?|pg||
nt|mcphee: S prrfers to stress @D rather than bid 2@C|pg||
nt|mcphee: E might have taken time to dble 3@H|pg||
nt|lelos: now forcing with 5-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Group B|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Kotinas 47|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Roussos 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Panagaki 29|pg||

nt|vugraphzge: Mitsi, Virvidakis 26|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Argyrou 24|pg||
nt|petrosa: zozis doesn't know the fit|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room: 3@D-4@S-all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will bid again |pg||
nt|rnmalik: good bid-but S has shown minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: just how many?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: for me 5@S if not DBL|pg||
nt|yuval10: it all sounds to North like S has a singel @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe bids 5 @H "on the way" |pg||
nt|yuval10: in wonder if pass from south over 5@d showed indeed minimal values|pg||
nt|yuval10: *i|pg||
nt|sybarra: or forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Dimos Dionysopoulos is in a jam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would treat 3@D is highly invitational|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S alerted, might show spades and clubs, if so , now possible W will lead a club against a slam|pg||
nt|olson: probably   takes a spade lead  to beat  5c   depends  who declares|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  konrakt @D preferowany dla NS w teh sesji, czy EW znajdÄ @H, na 2@H, 3@C juz nie idzie ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s is makeable|pg||
mb|4N|an|optional RKC|nt|haans: slam was not easy|pg||
nt|othered1: system didn't allow south to get his @C into the auction, so north is unlikely to find killling lead|pg||
nt|chick: any lead gives a trick, although clubs obviously best|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: room|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is impossible to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|haans: open 1nt pass pass pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or a diamond and a switch. |pg||
nt|olson: yes|pg||
nt|olson: but a trump  is possible to stop  ruffs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not easy for North - perhaps Jansma has evaluated his hand correctly|pg||
nt|sommer: splinter.. and soon 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to ask re q of sp  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but is better on E than W|pg||
mb|5C|an|min|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nikos intended 3@d as forcing I guess?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D wont catch too much in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: many N players would not bid 1@H after opening 1@C, but select 1NT instead|pg||
nt|zoh:  5@d kako score gia zeygi|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Q: what is the point of doubling 5@C when you already raised|pg||
nt|petrosa: where are the diamonds?|pg||
nt|eleni: quite a friendly lead from Fotis:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Fotis should find the 4@s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry about the mistake |pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I win this prize  (for what it is worth)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok- a coke:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: North worried about a trump lead as he does not have entries to continue the attack|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping to mae a ruff. More ammunition for my anti-doubleton-lead campaign|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: I know many north players who wouldnt bid anything |pg||
nt|liarakos: hmm|pg||
nt|lelos: something wrong with bidding proly|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is difficult to find 7-2 fit nowdays|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard (South) is trying to hit the deck!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes i think the pass was forcing|pg||
mb|5D|an|RKC|nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: I really like the bid 5 @H |pg||
nt|sommer: yes, 5@D now asks about @SQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d asking for @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
nt|loganrun: He needs his partner to have tricks and from his hand a heart looks most promising (as he has spade length) but...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer still needs 7 trump tricks|pg||
nt|olson: still some problems  , cannot pull 3 trumps and  if he does not  N  can ruff the heart trick while he discards  spade|pg||
nt|loganrun: Which adds to the plus of a heart lead - sorry Liz about your campaign|pg||
nt|olson: S needs to avoid  spade K back|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  czy nasi znajdÄ 2@S/3@D czt tez wolÄ broniÄ ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D is the q of spades ask,   |pg||
mb|5S|an|1|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
nt|chick: 4@C would have done it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||
nt|eleni: true, while at the other table Yiangos got a bit chicken|pg||
nt|cicus: E had two chances to bid the suit but failed to find them|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: all moot now, S is signing off in 5|pg||
nt|othered1: will south duck the first @D?|pg||
mb|5N|an|!s Q?|nt|petrosa: so more imps for Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|chick: well, good auction anyway, they found the right spot|pg||
nt|flash: again, many options...   |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: including @d7 :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has indeed 4th @s and a good spade @s, but XX @d and all other points are garbage|pg||
nt|sybarra: and denied?  or would 5 @H be the q? |pg||
nt|ralfwil: doesn´t 5@s deny @sQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: cue in clubs then all easy|pg||
nt|haans: not far fetch|pg||
nt|othered1: it's not unprecedented for declarer to get this right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice duck|pg||
nt|chick: wish my BIL students were here, took me about 3 weeks to convince them to duck the first diamond :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right or wrong, he can say that he thought about it.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I like all the bids except 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and perhaps that is why N should "respect" 5 @S    |pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt N has a good hand, after 3@S by S has 3 losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 @C drives them to 6 @S   the club bid may be the one you hate?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That's OK - I am not trying to be elected in the near future :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: might play it backwards |pg||
nt|sommer: they play 1st step apparently|pg||
mb|6D!|an|Yes, no K|nt|lelos: my guess is +2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: po tym wicie bêdzie ³atwiej|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  po tym wiscie moÅ¼e nawet 9 lew , na 3cie @H wyrzutka @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: N must bid more, with so many@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: And S followed the book.|pg||
nt|flash: :)     perhaps the most straightforward would be to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: 2 leads at the same time|pg||
mb|6H!|an|Last try|nt|warrens:  yes, should trust partner to go with an Ace and King or a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: at this level, yes I think so |pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, declarer could have afforded to win the first @H, but this is definitely safer|pg||
nt|flash: the alternative would be to play on @Ds; as we can see, that also works|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: clubs safer after the discard?|pg||
nt|flash: however, the entry situation looks to get quite tangled, if declarer goes after @Ds|pg||
nt|sommer: normal RKC is, that 5@S denies @SQ and 5@H SHOWS @HK + @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: he didn't describe his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: over 3@H he was probably obliged to bid his stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: Does ace give them an extra  undertrick?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but many pairs have reversed a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: last train at the 6 level LOL|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: not much to play for here|pg||
nt|othered1: win, @S10 and south has to duck again|pg||
nt|chick: only hope now is to drop the @SQ in 2 tricks, which doesn't happen|pg||
nt|chick: right Ed, that works for an extra spade trick, but not an entry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: E wanted very much to be in  7 |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: although can't argue with success, they *are* in the lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: strong point :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..last TRY..for grand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|eleni: a difficult decision for Mrs. Papypari|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know was making a joke, |pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of "last trainish"   for the grand |pg||
nt|sommer: W must even be a bit carefull to take the 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: just claim and get it over with|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the helpful lead a 600 is a bad score in pairs|pg||
nt|mcphee: more to the piont is how can you not lead @C?|pg||
nt|eleni: Papyraki|pg||
nt|othered1: wrong about that with this @C play.  YOu're right about @SQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petrosa: +8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|sQ|nt|eleni: so the system worked in this case:)|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In this board - a good rule/lesson. When declarer asks for the @D King, doÂ´nt even think about playing the Ace!|pg||
nt|chick: so he played for @SQ in N|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer praying for a miracle|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they believed the 5@c bid|pg||
nt|ghionis: give trick back|pg||
nt|ghionis: he is very polite":)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: pora na kara|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcphee: well S gets all the blame for this hand, N contriubted just a little|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a simple 2@s reverse from south would be enough. but anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: from his point of view West could have held a long @D suit|pg||
nt|haans: thta 2@C prempt was effective|pg||
pc|dK|nt|droopy17: -2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|zlatan: difficultto find it after the 2@h opening|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So West's cavalier style is not working for him so far|pg||

nt|petrosa: it was another flat board:)|pg||
nt|liarakos: 6@d at the open room|pg||
nt|ghionis: oh only the viewgrafer was:)|pg||
nt|haans: second slam try|pg||
nt|haans: with u (no joke 2)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dumme many tricks N/S here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean, that a declarer playing his sington King - he has NOT 2 or 3 small in the suit. He DREAMS about finding an opponent, who will take the trick|pg||
nt|flash: given the @H lead (and the split of that suit), i'd think that the odds of South having KQx of @Cs are quite slim|pg||
nt|chick: was actually pretty good play by W ... unlucky but he gave himself some chances|pg||
nt|othered1: 16 imps for the 730 on board 2.  EW were doubled making in OR.|pg||
nt|othered1: I really like NS's card so far.|pg||
nt|olson: well , the score is  32/0  so he  is not  complaining|pg||
nt|sommer: ..he was in no danger of course, when S couldn't play one more @S|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||
nt|haans: 6 minor|pg||
nt|flash: note that @Ds wouldn't have to be 3-3 for that suit to set up - Hx in either hand would suffice (declarer had all the spots)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Give me that @h suit, and @cKQx and I'd definitely bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 2 was another compression - Israel lost 500 in the other room for 18 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: they will find another slam|pg||
nt|eleni: bad board for E-W if they go up high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S vs 3@H|pg||
nt|loganrun: 4C doubled in the other room on the 1400 here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After the misfit on Board 2, we have the double fit|pg||
nt|loganrun: West thinks he knows what South has|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|MolvaM: a very heavy pass from east|pg||
nt|Gerben42: healthy pass :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly sensible to pass E I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yep|pg||

nt|droopy17: ne|pg||
nt|lelos: :)|pg||
nt|lelos: dificult not impossible|pg||
nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||
nt|liarakos: North opened 1@S|pg||
nt|liarakos: it was easier|pg||
nt|eleni: 3@d-1 were played in the open room|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||
nt|haans: not passing tiome South|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an interesting 2-way opening.  I wonder if NS were parpared for it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't deter S from bidding spades though|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a lot of information and might work out what's going on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew,  that was fairly agressive of S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: And he passes on a hand where I am sure I would bid :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: West going to bid id slowly to try and stop the save|pg||
nt|loganrun: Kibs saying why not show his majors but Jansma is playing a tactical game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 3@h from S perhaps|pg||
mb|p|an| |nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||

nt|chick: so does West :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know the range for east's opening?|pg||
nt|yuval10: or just 4@s|pg||
nt|val44: 1nt = 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d looks easy on EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: got to get there |pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|mcphee: 2@D some trick bid?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess 2@C shows a fit|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW have 3@S= or +1 and 4@C=|pg||
nt|flash: :)   |pg||
nt|flash: most pairs will have a check-back sequence available here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now North presumably knows partner has minors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should give them a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: to overtrick NS at or 1 down is good|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||
nt|petrosa: 8+|pg||
nt|haans: and they have @DA and not @CA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: where will this end?|pg||
nt|othered1: Still no certainty from west's perspective that east doesn't have the long @C hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lelos: gia pekse|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK Tasos:))|pg||
nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|jcone: makes without a hearts lead   K  will find it though|pg||
nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||
nt|cicus: for what reason?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry, can't tell|pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find for 2@H is that 1@H had been relay|pg||
nt|sommer: ..actually, forgot to say, S COULD have been squeezed for 13 tricks!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it was just making the contract and make no mistakes (now that we are in slam) |pg||
nt|sommer: ...he could just lean back and take the @S':)...but didn't bother|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: I will ask it later, thought it was C|pg||

nt|flash: we'd think that North had a plan in mind when he continued with 3@C|pg||
nt|flash: but, having found that the partnership has two 8-card fits, he's apparently thinking of bidding more|pg||
nt|sommer: ..ok he accepts minorgame +|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: it was right|pg||
nt|sybarra: egads we may end up in 6 @D |pg||

nt|hawe45:  Some battle here - 3 NT against 4 @H X|pg||
nt|haans: rummel what will u bid |pg||

mb|p|nt|MolvaM: ahh ok, I should write it down somewhere|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: sorry, his right :)|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  koncowka w czerowny dla nas :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: does north bid 1@s with that all the time? or only against ladies?|pg||
nt|mcphee: why E failed to bid will will never know|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room 5@d were played for -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: maximum|pg||
nt|haans: 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like support X |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now east alerts and west panics|pg||
nt|Gerben42: oh 1@S was a transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or does it have an other meaning?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Precision-style natural 2@C, articial 2@D enquiry|pg||
nt|sybarra: if 2 @D =spades, that was not the bid Jan wanted to hear |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: many would have tried it but ...|pg||
nt|chick: not nice to be on lead against a strong NT when you have scattered unsupported honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west has over stated the values of this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: half the fun then|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still a peaceful contract|pg||
nt|eleni: by N-S of course:)|pg||
nt|lelos: oops|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|flash: South's X shows @S length|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Jan bid 2 @S or 3 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way he can sit |pg||
nt|sommer: weak jump @S, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am being told it is multi over 1 @D |pg||
pc|hA|nt|MolvaM: we were expecting something like 3@cXXX|pg||
nt|petrosa: -1|pg||
nt|zlatan: no reopening??|pg||

nt|cicus: they may have problems unveiling their strength|pg||

nt|chick: does the X also establish @Cs as a real suit, I wonder|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ani w czarny ani w czerwony|pg||
nt|sybarra:  either weak M or strong club|pg||
nt|sommer: ..I think 1@H = f1 4+@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and was made in OR - (!)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: it is 6@s with 4-7 pnts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: East knows that pd never has anything|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2nt did show extra|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6xx|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure last hand was all luck.  EW's funny methods had set NS up for a big fall, but they weren't able to capitalize on it.  Says something about their methods and judgment ...|pg||
nt|othered1: to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees stated X on 3@s would be penalty, v Prooijen wasn't sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from E? I think he have to|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: This is the 3th time I operate a match played by them, and in all these matches they frequently fail on their system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 31C denying a 4card major, 3@D general force, I guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
nt|chick: I think I would have led a small trump, under the theory that anything else would give away a trick|pg||
nt|haans: many would have lead the single :))|pg||
nt|haans: hard to make|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|warrens:  double probably just showing a good hand, not direct penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not so easy to reach 3NT now|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  siÅa kompromisu :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: or "cards" |pg||
nt|sybarra: the "do something smart pard" X |pg||
nt|loganrun: Need to play 3NT and not 5C - this is tough|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  OH - 5 @C - no make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcphee: the t/o dble was getting the e/w pair off to the right fit had E bid|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: they did it|pg||
nt|flash: North's X apparently shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|loganrun: Well done|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you - 3@D asks for a singleton|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|flash: Board 4 turned into a 2-IMP gain for Netherlands!!  E-W reached 5@D in the Open Room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d lead had made it more difficult for the declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead would have, but why should north find it, since south didn't really bid @D, just transferred to @H, I think.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Redv=bl presumably 1st round control, so 3NT was easy after all|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loganrun: Great lead but for nought|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  dobrze ze dlugoÅÄ @C jest w rece W, inaczej 3nt byloby -1, zas koncowka w czerwony =|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: maksowy kontrakt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: W thinking and check CC of NS|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 3 the 4 spades played from other side,  making 4 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 5imps to Israel on Board 5 where they stopped in 3@C and made 11|pg||
nt|sommer: they don't play strong @C.. mixed @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C would be the inverted raise for @D |pg||
pc|c7|nt|zbig1959:  maxowym byloby 6@D , chyba|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba dla WE|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but 1@C is forcing - "polish-like"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he opened 1 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: "any 11" etc  unbalanced |pg||
nt|sommer: yes, and they answer with transfer...so hamay have agreed 2@D is similar to w2 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes they do play a mixed club |pg||
pc|cA|nt|liarakos: no swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than playing @s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: no clue|pg||
nt|othered1: west still needs to find the winning @D play and I'm not sure low to 10 is the best in a vacuum.  We'll have to see what other information he has at that point.|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  6@D, 2@H, bitka @H , 2@S (na impasie) = 11, zaÅ 12 na sqz w czarne p/ko W (tylko wist pikowy by zerwaÅ sqz)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ghionis: things are going bad for Altinis now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Always easier to make game when you are not in it :))|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|jcone: 4 clubs doubled down  a few    Maria=Salvation Army|pg||
nt|eleni: They play behind screens, yet they have 90 minutes for the 10 boards of this session......... though they are pretty behind time|pg||
nt|haans: now a make ruff a clubs|pg||
nt|flash: this appears to depend on an inspired guess in @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: and should now go down 1|pg||
nt|flash: aha - some of you are more awake than i - unless the @DK is dropped, declarer will probably end down 2|pg||
nt|flash: we'd assume that Jansma is trying to decide whether he needs to lead a @D here|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this plays as well from the void side |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a discard of @cK had made defence easier but difficult to see|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lelos: 9 easy tricks for a push|pg||
nt|chick: surprised they didn't have a good leadback signal for a spade|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lelos: @s is best now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sommer: we have time for a small personal note, right?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|d2|nt|flash: now Paulissen has two ways to beat this 2...   this is one of them|pg||
nt|flash: either red suit works now |pg||
nt|flash: Paulissen has played J, then T in @Cs, so the layout of that suit should be clear (??)|pg||
nt|flash: Board 5 in as a push - the Open Room might well pass us|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|brolucius: North really worth 2@S now.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has bid 2@S and now they should reach the slam.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|brolucius: South will be worried that the defenders can take two heart tricks on a heart lead.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: 2NT probably good bad to show weak diamond support.  As I said, would have made it a lot tougher on opponents by jumping in diamonds the first time|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|brolucius: He can either leap to 6@S and hope they do not find a heart lead, or bid it more scientifically by... oh, that has stopped me in my tracks. He has signed off!|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will leave it to the others to explain why 4@S is a good idea.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could expect partner to hold the @SK and would need only the @HQ or the lack of a heart lead in addition, to make the slam.|pg||

nt|brolucius: I would have bid 6@S to get the best practical chance of making the slam, and I am usually thought of as an underbidder. |pg||

mb|d|nt|haans: no no sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: N wants to bid more|pg||

nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma starts with 1@D in order to have a rebid should partner respond 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this nt is really heavy at the front|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma will discourage a @D continuation (?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: E just not finding his hand attractive |pg||
nt|warrens:  so W has 17+ with a least 5 @S's |pg||
nt|warrens:  nice to have a strong club to get out quickly|pg||
nt|loganrun: This 3NT is going to be hard to beat|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can this be 3@s 4@d  4@h etc?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no... but possible|pg||
nt|sommer: ..11 tricks in OR wasn't optimal...slam is good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 5@d from s?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..S can't pass now...must try at least|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@D is a fair try|pg||
nt|sommer: ..void, and invites|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky @D position for NT is unlucky for 5@C.  Best spot single dummy is 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: is S really thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: yes he was|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and after 5@d 5@h and 5nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
nt|flash: note the lead of the K - an attempt to hold the lead and let partner tell you what to do next|pg||
nt|flash: so West's cards should be suit preference, with a middle card suggesting a continuation of @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: they seem to play low disc, as paulissen already held the @h4|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if the partnership is on the same wave length|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 hts on the way for me|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on 4-3(!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
nt|othered1: And with the right partner you might get there if you can squeeze a 1@H opening out of the west hand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You and I will lead @DA, but only because we can see all 4 hands :)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: My money's on @HQ|pg||
nt|loganrun: I must admit that it is way down on the pecking order|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
nt|flash: good shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  I always say: it's ok to think, even if there's nothing to really consider|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it went 2 @C my guess it would go X,  and the doubling would start |pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
nt|othered1: Here niether major was ever in play.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not the time to look for overtricks - never give them a second chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: to ju¿ w dzisiejszych czasach z rêk¹ W nie mo¿na zalicytowaæ zwyk³e 2@H?|pg||
nt|sommer: now we see, S' problem was NOT slamtry, but grandslamtry:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but here that danger didÂ´nt exist - S had bid NT allready|pg||
nt|haans: withour @D bid from W|pg||
nt|othered1: Though this is a h and that would challenge most methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: question Warren, is how much energy to expend on this sort of hand |pg||
nt|yuval10: N wants @d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
nt|flash: Jansma couldn't be sure that the @D was cashing, so he shifted|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, so the diamond bid was kinda necessary, even if only to direct the lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|warrens:  if W finesses, S gets another ruff, that's why he went up|pg||

nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||
nt|haans: need spade K10 at west to make|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  to teraz maxowo, +1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cicus: and 4th best does not tell the quality of the suit, making a switch harder|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
nt|eleni: no way to save the -1:(|pg||
nt|bmkl: -2 maybe|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: uhh, I would feel terrible in EW shoes|pg||
mb|p|nt|liarakos: only 3N here|pg||
nt|flash: 5 and 6 in as pushes...   on 6, the Open Room played 4@S - this room ended, a bit strangely, in 4NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After a few boards of respite - back to the cruel deals|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Verhees uses a Stop card for alerting :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: brd 4 as i said W did open 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess i know him good enough then :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: KJ@D right cards for S|pg||
nt|warrens:  W must be thinking about 3N or X.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: and lost 4 imps:)|pg||
nt|loganrun: What to bid with East - I think his 2D is correct (suit quality) but 6C is now impossible to reach - (position of QD sort of telegraphed on the opening bid)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 2NT would be a bit of a distortion|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if Jansma cuebids he will surely rebid 3@D, since introducing a new suit generally shows extras|pg||
nt|loganrun: When I say impossible - much more difficult - although Jansma is opposite a partner who made a vul 2 over 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With these 2 nothing is impossible|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity we don't know what happened|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or maybe phantom?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||

nt|loganrun: Yes it does of course|pg||
mb|3H|an|5!s|nt|petrosa: -2 but you never know:)|pg||
nt|haans: assume x was negative |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'll try to find out when I have time|pg||
nt|aldek: club bids were all relays|pg||
nt|aldek: but you need an agreement about the redouble, another relay or a proposition to play|pg||
nt|sommer: ... but normal to sacrifice, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: insurance they call it |pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: we all agree, 4@S is down with best defence... both @C and @H lead set it|pg||

nt|rnmalik: sorry they won 4imps:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
nt|flash: if 1@D showed @Hs (as seems likely), South's X probably shows 3-card spt|pg||
nt|aldek: you can make 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|aldek: 6 in both spades and diamonds is doomed|pg||
nt|aldek: Kwiecien has a choice, show his diamonds or set spades as trumps|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  ostro grajÄ , po @s szybki obkÅad|pg||

nt|warrens:  avoided taking a unilateral position.  but 5@C will be down 1|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but as said: The "insurance is very normal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: a red flag works too :)|pg||
nt|othered1: only 7 top tricks with poor @C break.  Let's see how declarer attacks the 8th.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: Maybe an medieval cannon will do it too|pg||
nt|warrens:  3N would have been down at least 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  North very disciplined not to bid 4@S over the neg X|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S = weak 4@S = firm|pg||
nt|chick: Multumiri, Riinu :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems to have been a @C-lead in OR|pg||
nt|chick: always nice to know what's going on besides the bridge :)|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes that would have been -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: both rooms were in 6 @S on bd 5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be a @h lead to defeat 4@s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
nt|flash: Ace and a @H to beat this?|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, North has shown @H length and South 3-card spt, Jansma will find it|pg||
nt|flash: if, instead, the meaning of the bids is different, there's no particular reason to lead the suit|pg||
nt|aldek: now they will reach a slam|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||

nt|cicus: can't be either (no X from west)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: A good shot but only for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: so I am totally in the dark|pg||
nt|haans: this is good bridge Strong clubs and opps bid game|pg||
nt|chick: besides the bidding and play :P|pg||
nt|warrens:  E thinking how to make this assuming the @H K is onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean off side k of @H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: wait till he finds @C 4/1 |pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he's has to assume it's onside and still would have work to do.  of course, here it will be more a matter of not going down 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: going to go check on poland match  be back shortly |pg||
nt|warrens:  if the heart K is onside, the best line might be to take an immediate heart finesse, and assuming it works, cash the heart Ace and ruff a heart High|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@H probably kickback - control ask. Otherwise 4@S is a Zia cuebid|pg||
nt|loganrun: I wonder what 4D was?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it is spring - a time for optimism|pg||
nt|sommer: sure?|pg||

nt|mcphee: S needs to find a @C now|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, this line has the advantage of not needing hearts to break.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: After @DA lead and a singleton club switch, on the previous board, South would get his club ruff but declarer would then have two pitches for his heart losers.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's 3@S shows closer to a normal 2@S raise than a normal 3@S raise. With the latter hand, he would probably bid 4@S after the intervention.|pg||

nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
nt|othered1: has that look to it|pg||
nt|chick: didn't 1@C show 5 spades and 4 minor a while ago?|pg||
nt|loganrun: Double from East? - no|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that was 2@c|pg||
nt|othered1: That was 2@C|pg||
nt|chick: oh, sorrrryyyy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its interesting to me how often a trump lead against these partscore deals is right--even with a dangerous holding|pg||
nt|aldek: will go down 1 or 2, but both 2@H and 3@D make easily|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb (old English proverb)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W doesn't want to play game even against 14 from P|pg||
nt|loganrun: What is the Scottish equivalent Liz - does it involve haggis?|pg||
nt|sommer: good choice by N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs a @h lead to defeat|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
nt|othered1: They do canape with some openers.|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S looks as good a spot as any, especially with the @S pips.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the tradidional play in @s with a small from dummy when W is declarer:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it is simply neutral to lead a trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a low ht at that right?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or ace another point out to me  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *pointed |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
nt|flash: if anyone can find a link to the N-S convention card, some of these mysteries might be solved   :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very few things involve haggis :) Just as well, really|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  impas @S, odpadajÄca 2ga Q@H lub T@H (albo podziaÅ @H 3-3) i 10 lew|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt it still go down now?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 12 tricks if S plays @sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||
nt|eleni: Let's hope Aris Filios will think of the @c slam|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Animesh:) welcome:)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ty:) sry running late here:)|pg||
nt|eleni: We finally arrived at the last board for this evening@h@h TY all for been here with us, thx George also and thx to our today's operators, Effi+Giannis and of course the Hellenic ...|pg||
nt|eleni: Bridge Federation@h@h|pg||
nt|haans: body wouth a lot|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And now the diamond switch|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  X z pozycji W daje szanse  ze ma duÅ¼o, tzn AK@D tez .. daleka dorga do 10 lew|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what east knows at th is point and why west is thinking? |pg||
nt|othered1: What leeway would west have in an auction like this, unless he feels it has gone off the tracks somewhere?  Or do I totally misunderstand what's been going on here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W cannot play the mathematical correct way (run @s9) because of too few entries|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It's not a terrible opening bid, with 4-4 in the Majors - but it is being punished|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2 flat boards on 7&8 - down to a mere 7 imps a board after a flying start|pg||
nt|loganrun: Rise ace and play on clubs - damage control|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spoke too soon - 15 imps to Netherlands on 9 when North was alloed to play 4@H-3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Opened 4@H - good effort IMO|pg||
nt|loganrun: Board 9 - 4H passed out - for another 15 for the Dutch|pg||
nt|loganrun: It certainly worked well on the hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even if he rises @DA here East can hold off @CA and he has no quic entry to dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
nt|othered1: of course a @C lead beats slam, no matter how declarer plays trumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW are in the best contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lelos: another push|pg||
nt|animeshraj: wow!|pg||
nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
nt|othered1: To understand the defense, we need to know what west has shown, it might be very explicit.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: west showed 3415|pg||
nt|othered1: any specifics on high cards/controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: with 8-12 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: so what would west have been thinking of over 4@S?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no possible entry to N hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well guess not |pg||
pc|h6|nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for 140|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: good bye htsz |pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|zbig1959:  ufff, poszÅo :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: If there is any children here. Put them at an other room for some minuts:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgs: He wasn't sure what he did show, dummy explained it to all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But knocking out West's entry was a good shot|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: still a hurdle|pg||
pc|hT|nt|maj_gr:  haha|pg||
nt|cicus: can play west, the overcaller for @DAK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: playing very fast|pg||
nt|haans: odd play in hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a @D-lead would have been no better|pg||
nt|garnetts: good card from East |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|flash: good hand for everyone to stretch, refill coffe cup, etc...   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Bye all|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu :)  ciao all |pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: well done Aava|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8612825.stm  for the sad news in case you haven't heard|pg||
nt|loganrun: Yes but the Queen of spades was the entry to the clubs - they work out about the same|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thx all and bye for now:)|pg||
