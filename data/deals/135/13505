nt|bjacobs: Tough for North.  MIGHT have risked 5@S over 4@S?  Or whatever asks for heart control|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: oh, a new development! trying to give him another chance|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bjacobs: But equally, South could have heart control, and 6@S still have zero play|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some help seemed given anyway.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, this is devastating for East|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: He did this purely to teach any new players who might be watching why bidding after making a pre-empt is wrong.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I'm sorry to say, he deserved it.  5@H was a shocking bid, assuming that 2@H had shown hearts and a minjor|pg||

nt|bjacobs: No blame to West - he was the straight man|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East might think he was unlucky, but 5@H had very little upside.  For starters, West almost certainly has only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Might. Might not. Never a @H lead after this bid.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, excuse me.  If the club lead was wanted by East, he could have bid 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5H made no sense at all. if u r going to bid--and why would you? -- then bid 5C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So don't blame West!|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yeah a heart lead makes sense - no 5c bid, no double of 6s|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there Bill. BUT do NS tell control at @H by there 6@S? What are W gona do then?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Who knows.  Maybe the two suits were reversed.  East has @HKQ and @CA, and the heart lead is needed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: E didn't bid his cards well and W didn't read the lead well.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would make a little more sense of the 5@H bid|pg||
mc|7|nt|marlowepi: Bottom line for that hand: very very often justice is served in an unjust way, one that defies cause-effect analysis. if you play those silly weak 2-suiters, the forces of bridge ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this is the sort of hnd that often plkays better in 3N despite the 63 fit, but not easy to fetch up there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: West leads a trump to stop dummy's ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Note that IF you are going to lead a trump, low from J10x is generally the right play|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just in case partner has a singleton honour|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, not a good lead. N probably has 3 trumps, and may be 4333. meanwhile, W hardly has the other suits controlled and there is a geuine danger of dummy providing discrads|pg||

nt|marlowepi: of course, D could be a disaster too, and you really want the spade king to be a trick, meaning you want declarer to have the ace|pg||

nt|marlowepi: once u decide to lead a club, there is a strong case for leading the king|pg||
nt|bjacobs: why king?|pg||
nt|rodal f: She was a bit hard by 4NT Y. But how to bid the slam?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dummy is likely to have a stiff club, which could be the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT force and later? Or 3@H force?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is difficult.  A complete cross ruff works, but only because West has @H10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then if dummy is 5521, the club ace might provide discard for D. admittedly, when u have Jxx of Ds on this auction, it may not matter|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: cant he just draw 2 rounds of trumps and ruff 1 diamond and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might work, but of course you might need trumps 2-2 for the line|pg||
nt|rodal f: % for @H 2-2 is 40.7|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: if trumps are 3-1 he still has spade finesse and diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well yes, but you need to compare this with the cross ruff line, which doesn't actually necessarily need anything|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, 40% a priori but after W has shown a proclivity for trump leads, he is more likely to be short in trumps, changing the odds:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The key is truly what the third round of diamonds brings ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if Ds are not 5-1, just ruff 2 clubs & a D high|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the only problem is how to cater to 5-1 Ds if possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or 4-0 hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You may well be right ... club ruff, diamond king, club ruff, trump, diamond ruff high, top trump, trump to hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: heres a line: draw 2 trumps, if 2-2 ruff a diamond and 2 clubs. if 3-1 see if diamonds break, if they don't, ruff a diamond and a club and take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think a top trump shd be played early to verify they are not 40|pg||
