mb|1D!|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|andyv:  1D should be the majors|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|3S!|nt|andyv:  E being too fancy with a weak hand... probably should just bid 4@s to jam the bidding and force NS to guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  spec informs me that 1@d is both majors or both minors|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction starting to have a life of its own.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Do u feel that WE was a bit lucky here Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: playing Geologi Timah, fro Bandung's Geological Institute|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well I asked for the best line.|pg||
nt|josj: lead a @C raher than a @H from dummy to find out the exact layout|pg||
nt|josj: so a very lucky escape there with 4@S easily made|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|josj: not really|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u was. Dont play thrumh. Asu said Jos:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: S got what he was looking for|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldjean: let's see if E/W play garbage stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  should stop at 4@s|pg||
nt|josj: Laksamana is a team from Pekanbaru, not too far away from Batam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhh: ...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|josj: Gabrial is one of the teams representing UI: Universitas Indonesia|pg||
nt|josj: this is in Depok, 40 km S of Jakarta |pg||
nt|rodal f: No comment here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: After 2 and 3 @D my fealing was 4@D from W but he did right by the X.|pg||
nt|rodal f: feeling*|pg||
pc|c5|nt|baldjean: apparently they do|pg||
pc|c6|nt|josj: MGTH means"may good things happen"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|josj: but it always remains to be seen for which side :)|pg||
nt|josj: and a more quiet deal here but 7 tricks are far away for EW, I think|pg||

nt|josj: again trump lead is best|pg||
pc|d8|nt|baldjean: the way cards lie even 4 woujld make though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|josj: and this time,the leader has a few of them|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spot I like. Could have been better at an other contract.|pg||
nt|josj: but the contract not really in danger anyway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: 3@C que by @D|pg||
nt|josj: hi Adi :)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|soban: from other semi final GEOLOGI TIMAH leading 30 imps againt BHINEKA (Henky Lasut, Eddy Manoppo, Jemmy Bojoh, Leslie Gontha)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why could not N pass for a check at @S?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|josj: this is teams so np |pg||
nt|rodal f: If u don't cover a honor u don't have (the@SQ)|pg||
nt|josj: now he can always ruff a club and throw one on @DK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|josj: S is too strong to be able to find the @S fit, it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish relays would have helped here|pg||
nt|josj: or a gadget to rebid 2NT to show 24-25|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|andyv:  kokish (and reverse kokish) are useful tools since a strong 2@c takes up so much bidding space|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|josj: there go the @H tricks for the def.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ferlema: con la linea que esta jugando Esteban hay 10 bazas|pg||
nt|josj: should end up with an overtrick now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks even|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: ? How could Tobing find that??|pg||
nt|josj: throw the last club and play trumps...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|josj: in the 2 previous matches they did not as these matches both ended in a blitz|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1N|nt|rodal f: A very normal contract by 21HPEW it was.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|josj: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|baldjean: 3nt is my prediction|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: EW can escape for a tolerable penalty against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ferlema: al margen que Norte y Sur tomaron la buena desicion de jugar en el 4/4|pg||
nt|soban: While Denny (Sacul - Franky Karwur, Donny Tuerah memed Hendrawan) play for Syabas Energy fail go to semi final.  |pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weak NT came at 3rd hand again for NS. |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pass??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now a very tolerable penalty. D lead best|pg||
nt|josj: easy going for EW to the right contract|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|ferlema: 3NT no se ganan, Pugliese dio una pequeña ayuda para que le ganen la mano|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's 2nd dbl probably influenced by the vul|pg||
nt|josj: let's hope so :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: less ambitious this time but easy enough|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N kept doubling until they escaped to his best suit, where he has 100 honours, and then just passed. not an obvious choice|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  the bad @d break isn't as bad as it looks for S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ferlema: el declarante debe tratar de hacer dos bazas de espadas, una de corazon, tres de diamante y cuatro de trebol|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ferlema: pequeño error de Norte que debio desbloquear el palo de trebol sirviendo el J|pg||
nt|ferlema: conservqndo una entrada adicional al muerto conservando el @C 10 como entrada|pg||
nt|ferlema: en este caso va a pasar desapercibido|pg||
nt|josj: and this an easy game as well|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: if def. play @H dummy has to ruff with relatively high trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Can't see any possible fun here.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|rodal f: Any to come from EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: to beat 6D, W must lead ace and shift to trump|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit nice by % now.|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H is interesting|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ferlema: suponemos que Gabriel sobre 2@C invitarà con 3 @H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  3N is tempting but 5@d probably more practical for NS... both contracts have problems to overcome|pg||
nt|josj: a remarkable misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1NT=2/1 it seems.|pg||
nt|josj: even more so after this X|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: which "places" @SA in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i predict next call will be 7D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: aha|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 7 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|josj: does N show a very strong hand now?|pg||
nt|josj: in the meantime, declarer went down in his good 4@H when he lost control of the trumps|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ferlema: la mejor linea es jugar sobre el corazón|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was the 2S bid that made him do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|josj: looks like a very lucky 3NT with @CAK both in S|pg||
nt|josj: even more so when you don't bother about the 4-4 @S fit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But find 4-2 in @C is only 24.25% and the hooka bit less. S could have.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Declarer will not be happy that @ds don't run|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the longer he thought, the more it lloked like he would shrug & do it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky S -- the same defense beats 6 :):)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldjean: this double might prove to be painful for E/W|pg||
nt|josj: after the @S lead, @HA and low to the jack looks best, also for reasons of communication|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: well, he might realise that they won't run in OR either...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ferlema: no|pg||
nt|ferlema: que mal|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: 2-4 or 4-2 makes 48.5% and 3-3 makes 35.5%|pg||
nt|josj: I was looking at a show-up-squeeze on S after playing a @S to the K S's discard may be informative... |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ferlema: el pudo haber hecho 2 bazas de espadas, trres de corazon una de diamante y tres de trèbol|pg||
nt|josj: seeing the @C 5-0 might then add to his comfort|pg||
nt|josj: but 3@H is never in danger|pg||
nt|josj: unless Ong plays for @H 4-1 in S...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a interesting variant from u Job.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-2 at the odds. 68%|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr tlf. brb|pg||
nt|josj: are we stuck?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|josj: declarer did not believe his luck at trick 1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: there is the losing @H finesse coming up...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: 1NT was force for one round and from there the @S was lost. Just the @Cto hit now.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|josj: remarkable swing to JB on  1|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|josj: still possible to make as N should hold 4 @S and thus 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|josj: unblocking @C9 is automatic, we assume :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|josj: rehi|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: should be made now as a @C goes on the @DA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  5@d does have a shot since a @s will be led... may be time to set up @cs for pitch of @hs (highly unlikely but stranger things have happened)|pg||
nt|josj: cashing out for -1|pg||
nt|josj: if declarer guesses right on the obvious @C return|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Wrong I was. As normal. Might.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|ferlema: viendo las cartas se aprecia que Sur siempre iba a perder 3 bazas de espadas y dos de corazon|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Here indonesia again came by a weak NT. Asave for EW this time.|pg||

nt|josj: S will say: "Thank you, partner!"|pg||

pc|dT|nt|josj: but which finesse to take? |pg||
nt|josj: on the @SK lead, 5@D is through|pg||

nt|andyv:  in OR, they played 5@d|pg||
nt|josj: NS heading towards slam here so the play might be relevant...|pg||
nt|josj: I think Taufik will win the match for his team if he makes this|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might me who don't understand anything here.|pg||
nt|josj:  17 is a big swing to Geo|pg||
pc|s6|nt|josj: except on a @D lead by W (which I expect)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ws 1NT was?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Do u trust ure pard when u play Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: well, W's 1@S kept NS out of their 4-4 fit but 3NT is a safe spot|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|josj: no,  17 is a surprise push|pg||
nt|josj: but still, Taufik has to make; if he goes down, his side loses the lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|rodal f: % for a honor+1 in @C is 16.2. But is it the A or Q now?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: A or J I ment. Sr.|pg||
nt|josj: off we go... (one off, that is)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Bookmark this for a bit help: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not EW used weak NT before by there card? And now 16 + full X for it?|pg||
nt|josj: but with the @H friendly, 4@S would not have been in any danger|pg||

nt|josj: NS are the weak NT'ers|pg||

nt|rodal f: I try to do.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. I take that.|pg||
nt|josj: so congrats to Gabrial UI on winning the Inter Clubs Championship, part of the national championships , played in Batam|pg||

nt|josj: skipping a board because we are caught up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are some funny cards for a fight here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael's bid does not thrill W who can guess which minor pd has|pg||
nt|josj: making 4@H is a good result for JB in OR|pg||
nt|josj: it can easily be duplicated here but NS have a lot of losers to cope with|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A lucky 3NT stop?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bidding for noe Jos?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldjean: 3nt now|pg||
nt|andyv:  W happy to be out of it... does everyone Michael's the E hand with 6@s and 5@c?|pg||
nt|josj: this looks strange|pg||
nt|josj: I think E opened 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: now 2NT from North presumably|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway 5@D is safe.|pg||
nt|rodal f: for u now Jos?|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D was a Flannery variation|pg||
nt|josj: showing 4-5 in majors and a normal opening hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: 1NT rebid now shows 15-17 as NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|josj: seems to be Roland Wald's pet convention :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|josj: what happened in OR? I cannot believe this result...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D and 2@D was inverted minor it seems. I use it when I have 5.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: why not?|pg||
nt|josj: like they did in the 1st segment, Tobing-Asbi miss a non-vul. game|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 3NT , sorry|pg||
nt|april7: will end up in 3NT and S has to guess everything especially after a @C lead, but W will lead @H mostprobably|pg||
nt|andyv:  just curious if some restrict themselves to only the minor can be longer|pg||
nt|josj: occasionally, you hold a 7-6|pg||
nt|josj: maybe the board is misplaced on the table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzhu: rotate board|pg||
nt|josj: as I thought...|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhu: North held South's hand and West held East's hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: so this is probably going to make at an important stage of this short match|pg||
pc|h8|nt|josj: nice X by W|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but those you always know wha to do:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: I just wander where N found his exstra by the bad 14H?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|baldjean: which will give declarer a trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East must have been quite close to opening 2@C, if that option is available|pg||
nt|josj: to beat this, a quick @H shift is needed|pg||
nt|josj: good lead for the def.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: I understand S by the bid. Hard to see the nice fit.|pg||
nt|josj: good they did...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|josj: he was taking an advanced save|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H often a easy raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be a big swing for EW|pg||
nt|josj: declarer left to his own resources|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  W should duck|pg||
nt|rodal f: What would 2NT be ower the 2@H?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  by S?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|josj: in the meantime, the 2 big swings to Gabrial have materialised...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Min invit.|pg||
nt|josj: he did well to steal a @S trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: and thus could finesse the @C for free|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h9|nt|josj: helped by the X, EW fnd the right def|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreement.... some play it as still limit raise in @hs... others and invit. in NT|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|baldjean: declarer will get the rest|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|nt|josj: in OR E returned a club at this stage, letting the contract through|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|april7: interesting that E after an "impossible" @C lead by W , must have to  duck first trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  and EW did bid the slam on board 5|pg||
nt|josj: if NS miss another game, they will lose the lead temporarily|pg||
nt|josj: better not to open W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 2@S is a good final contract though the lucky @D split might produce a second overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: kind of astonishing N bid only 3S over the transfer. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|josj: nor the E hand btw :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: East will not like this|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't agree by the biddings at non of them.|pg||
nt|rodal f: N alerted multi and E to be killed?|pg||
nt|josj: 4@H looks reasonable enough but might be difficult to handle...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ferlema: sin ser exitista, muy bien Sur y Oeste|pg||
nt|rodal f: I belive Gabsi is the best here. Exelent work done:) U have been the glue.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall of the strong club - very disciplined by North. As we can see, 4@S makes NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange to open W hand with 1H. was not aware they play canape|pg||
nt|josj: support X by S, I hope and assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be the last board for this set.. thank you all for joining us.|pg||
nt|josj: in OR S opened 1@S so game was inevitable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: X=3c suppost I presume|pg||
nt|josj: the intervention was slightly mistimed but how could E know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt even have a double of FIVE spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: support*|pg||
nt|josj: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|josj: but a little ambitious maybe, under 50%|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@s bid will not inspire S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: visions of 1,400 here...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: last hand, good luck to all and good night.|pg||
nt|josj: well, had the @C been able to run, 3NT would have been a fine shot|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see a funny push?|pg||
nt|josj: might go more than -2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: it looks very easy to play the ten here  |pg||
nt|josj: a @C lead certainly is best|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  this NT a bit more solid that a couple of the others in this set|pg||
nt|josj: maybe declarer has a chance now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: well done South|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: E innputed from the start, but was it right contract?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N needs to knock out Ace of @d and then finesse @h into W|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|josj: playing a @D to the 9 after cashing 2 @C looks the plan|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: 6@D would have been excellent at about 90% but neither team attempted it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: the easy road to defeat|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  now duck @s twice|pg||
nt|andyv:  once|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ferlema: 3 multas|pg||
nt|andyv:  should take this|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 times some could have been taken. Onse from NS and twice from EW. It cost a bit by miss the alert.|pg||
nt|josj: but not if you throw dummy's @D|pg||
nt|josj: if you lead the first @D from W you cannot go wrong...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: I am still wondering about the scoring of  9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  will cost an imp|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: anyway: this is the last board of the 1st quarter. We will go on shortly|pg||
nt|josj: N is marked with the ace so that is what declarer will probably do|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: but even if N overcalls , might be not easy to reach 4 @S, now it could be a good score for EW, even if W goes down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: the king play caters to any honour in the North hand, as well as the actual layout|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: which will enable the players to enjoy a longish dinner break|pg||

nt|andyv:  and a tied match:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think winning the 2nd @s can possible be wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: after a short break,we continue the 2nd 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't have more than 3@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Se u Liliek if ok:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: By andy was nice|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some made the premium.|pg||
nt|josj: we will continue with the final in just over half an hour, at 16.00 WIB or 10.00 GMT|pg||
nt|josj: with only boards 17 and 18 to go in OR, I bet Gabrial UI MGTH will qualify...|pg||
nt|josj: they were both good for them here in CR|pg||
nt|josj: so ty Adi, ty Rødal and cu all shortly|pg||
nt|soban: the FINAL GEOLOGI TIMAH versus GABRIAL UI MGTH in 20 minutes.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cQ|pc|s9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|josj: so 18-12 VP to JB and we will continue in about 15 mins, I think|pg||
nt|josj: am i right, Adi?|pg||
pg||
