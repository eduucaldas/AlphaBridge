nt|hedyg: not quite enough for a smolen sequence|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: and too much for anything else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Don't se why not :) North could be more suitable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: you think you can impose game with that S hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I expect this was a forcing dequence - no reason why North coudn't have 4 spades ot 3 hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: sure, but would like to find the fit first|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Proabaly best to use Stayman and proceed only if partner shows a major - but not everybody plays simple Stayman these days|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This contract is not without chances|pg||
nt|hedyg: he isnt tempted to play a @c back|pg||
nt|hedyg: if pd wanted @ds he might have led 1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: True - but he needs to go somewhere for tricks. Rightly assumes that North must have good diamonds |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: W getting squeezed|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will not let go another @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not when he can see 4 in dummy. Also becoming clear to everyone where all the points are|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|daman: we are not familiar with the systems and will do the best we can |pg||
nt|daman: North should open a strong NT normally|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|daman: well   they must play a different range|pg||
nt|daman: and a 1NT rebid would show 15-17|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: italians opened 1@d with zero cards @d <previous segment>, responder had 3 HCP and bid at 1 level, i think they like artificial relays|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H must show 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: and 2NT = 15-17|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: makeable contracts 2@s for NS, 4@h for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h hard, requires much, ie @h finesse to hand, kind of double dummy problem|pg||
nt|daman: South should pattern his hand and bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|daman: a spec tells me 2@H was to show 5-4 and not 4-5 in the majors|pg||
nt|daman: they must have reversed it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|daman: @C 8 is a huge card|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it won't be a big surprise for me to watch aggsressive bidding & carding|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|daman: I would have led the @H J and not the 9    to give me the option of overtaking with the @H 10 down the road|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: ie @sQT8 vs 4@s very risky lead, but opening leader Lanzarotti did it on previous session|pg||
nt|daman: win and play another @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, return to sender good idea|pg||
nt|daman: he should make 8 tricks on a @C endplay    or there might be a squeeze against East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which could work well in given layout|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Must wake up! best chance was to endplay East, the it does not matter who has @DJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: West had to return a diamond, I think - may not be obvious|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: when he knew N had 5 @ds..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s a bit too strong for me|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Mike Lawrences suggests 2@C should still be Drury after a t/o double or an overcall - that way you can stop opposiet rubbish|pg||
nt|hedyg: either that or some other agreement|pg||
nt|hedyg: E opened 1 @s in CR...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even a transfer response where 2@D is stronger than 2@H would help|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: in 1st seat|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: see 1@s with 8HCP|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Il buon giorno si vede dal mattino (the good day can be seen from the morning)  1 supposedly good for NS pair|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and 4 HCP 2@s |pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: but NS were prepared|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: that's simply destructive bidding understanding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|daman: as long as they understand it     the system can cause havoc|pg||

pc|sA|nt|phil: if you dont get the spade lead, and find the split I think you are forced into the winning line|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: Hi Daniela|pg||
nt|daman: a very intelligent auction|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|chick: E could have led his singleton @D and gotten a ruff, but then N  could pitch the losing club on diamonds, so it wouldn't help set the contract.  Might have held them to just making|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|chick: As it is, declarer will set up @Ds himself, and still get the club pitch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s = Tempo al tempo (all in good time) & Tutte le strade portano a Roma ( all roads lead to Rome)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will possibly play on diamonds himslef, while he still has the trump entries in dummy |pg||
nt|chick: yes, he needs to knock out the @DA soon|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|hedyg: strong @c opening it seems|pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: yes getting to slam after W opened isnt obvious|pg||
nt|hedyg: that W hand doesnt look like a vulnerable opening to me|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And the East hand does not look like a 'free' response - but they ahve paid their money|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: queens are overrated|pg||
nt|phil: singleton aces are really overated|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: N would like to cuebid now|pg||
nt|hedyg: preferably 4@H|pg||
nt|phil: depends on what redbl means |pg||
nt|hedyg: since he didnt open 1@d i assume 1@c is strong|pg||
mb|5H|nt|phil: Im quite sure North thinks that 1@s xx'd can be made, but beyond that...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Might be 2-way|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A 'Sweep' cue - shows all the controls or you would not be worth a cue at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: you must be right Liz|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 18 he opened 1 @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: so maybe 2way|pg||
nt|phil: that would explain 2@h instead of 2@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe one day players on VG will post their CCs for us.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@s would ask for @H control so N must have that himself|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|daman: a slam on this one|pg||

nt|h_karluk: like an everyday one|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wow, I've never been wrong before :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if they can get there after the opening bid|pg||
nt|daman: North should at least make a try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N can easy dictate|pg||
nt|daman: maybe South should have bid 2@D and then 4@S    unless that shows a different hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3A, 2K should not be hard to visualize|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d really nice|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i guess north would read well and pull|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh done|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Garozzo is East at the othe table |pg||

nt|hedyg: if W had bid 2@d (transfer) N might have been able to bid 2@H|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Many people play 2@C over 1NT as showing both majors (here 2spades, 5+hearts) and 2@D as showing 1 major - here hearts|pg||

pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Assuming you are playing Rubensohl when they overcall 1NT, you should check your adaptations when it is a 1NT overcall  - the more you can discuss with partner the better|pg||
