nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: running realtime totals [many very close matches] at http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in some auctions NS use "zz points"  these are also known as AKQ points  where A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: hold on for 1@D alert    a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) (10)11-15(16) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  c) (10)11-15(16) any 4441|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: their 2@C opener is either 5@C4@D or 6+@C but not 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|blum1956: South needs a heart guess to make 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he ends up declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IFF|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi all    ty Roland|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now West probably doubles|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi commentators|pg||
nt|blum1956: If not? East surely takes a save|pg||
mb|5S|nt|blum1956: wow|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: exactly right Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: find the @H10 and 5@C was on.  Good save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have a CC for EW :(|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|blum1956: too much risk in the vulnerability given. Mathematical chances clearly for save|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: nothing in the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told EW play Polish Club|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well fantun has eliminated the the losing diamond hook but down 3 another way|pg||
nt|kareno: It was the Miami endplay.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i want to know what he has, ot describe my hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all nice close match|pg||
nt|mamos: and an exciting hand to start|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: at this vul  1N would be 14-16    why 1@H instead of 1@D like earlier hand??   i wish i knew|pg||
nt|kareno: Famous play - you put them in and they take the rest of the tricks :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|wstuart: 5@D is a nice contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why Miami|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he bid 5 @H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Artificial Game Force|pg||
mb|5S|nt|wstuart: but the 4-1 @D will give it probelms.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ok specs sending me swanbridge site & bridgewinners.com thx|pg||
mb|d|nt|bg: board 11 did not bid 6 dia either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|mgchat: ah ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: anything can be good in these situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what do we think about 4 spade bid?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, I suspect it has to do with the number of retirees who live there and it is a bit prejudiced on the strength of their game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: typical fredin :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: South should clearly RDBL here, not 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: questionalbe pass by landen|pg||
nt|kareno: Let me quickly add that it was not so named by me.  I first heard of it in about 1969!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of any fast tricks suggests 4@H to me|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: do we have to reply?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|odysseus69: up to you Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would XX |pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead and the entry is burned at once.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|wstuart: RDBL will show the A, pard will be in a position to judge if the single stopper is right for his intentions in any contract at any level.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT might keep them out of a slam or misjudge whether 3NT or 5@D is a better strain.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs a few good guesses here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|reisig: one "guess" goes away fast|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Rich|pg||
nt|sybarra: RR  @H|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya :) :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that didnt paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|reisig: Shirl @H|pg||
nt|reisig: When the 4@d show up ..the @s becomes easy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bg: questionable if 4 spades is a good bid then 4 hearts will not be a good bid result wise with 4 trumps and two aces I would probably let them play 4 hearts|pg||
nt|afulton: hi|pg||
nt|spooky: hello all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so we expect a multi-purpose 1@C from Campbell   unless they have a multi-2 opener that has strong options|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Polish Club  usually weak NT, but could be medium hand with @C  or any big hand [as here]|pg||
nt|dburn: North might bid at the colors, though it is not clear to intervene on rubbish against a Polish-style 1@c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: Fredin-Fallenius  2@C-2@D//3N-end|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|blum1956: best is to double those mad bidders now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dburn: well, if East believes that he can sit for 2@s doubled, though this requires courage|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 3NT is tough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not easy to see how it made|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: East doesn't realize just how good his black suit holdings are for 3N or defense  ... but not 3@C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: in 3N   1)  @S to Ace 2) @S  3) @HJ ducked  4) @CQ Thurston won K  eventual 9th trick with dummy's @S9|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c will be an easy make but not a success against 3NT making  other room|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it made because East's red-suit holdings (in particular @h10) were just what declarer needed, and also because Fredin played with great skill|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: new record just set --  3rd rain storm of the day in the arizona desert|pg||

nt|mamos: at least he's dealer  when you have a big hand you dont wat to be fourth at these colours cos they will all have bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall opened 2@S so we won't seen 2N in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piek DBL  so unable to stop in 2N|pg||

nt|bg: nervous declarer right now how can we tell him not to worry|pg||
nt|hedyg: we cannot|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he should worry|pg||
pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: rule of 11 makes good club prospect- and he cant go down- very well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not home yet|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: bit early for dinner,  but it might be the cocktail hour |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: we know from the GREAT showing in a couple of events this year, that Bessis pretty close to French Standard|pg||
nt|afulton: Looks like some sort of strong @c system by NS ... |pg||
nt|spooky: 6@S needed a @D lead to beat it.. this will be over soon|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches playing same boards|pg||

nt|sharynr: close match!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: this is very interesting     I think the @H shift and continuation will defeat 2 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West opend 1NT so no danger|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ducking again not good|pg||
nt|mamos: and a close hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: Now, I could be coerced into THAT!|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but 1@h= either transfer bid (as Fleisher / Kamil) use or control showing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|reisig: It's ALWAYS cocktail hour somewhere|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well he gets credit too|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dburn: well, he followed suit when asked to by Campbell, who certainly did not play badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz, maybe FG strength    [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) any 20+ HCP  b) 16-19 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's as far as my notes go :(|pg||
nt|dburn: but Canada missed out at the other table, where they opened 1@d and thereafter did not bid at all|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Fredin overcalled 2@C with West hand -- brutal|pg||
nt|dburn: which was a pity, given that they could make 4@h|pg||
nt|blum1956: Fredin-Fallenius succeeded in buying the contract in the closed room - one more huge success|pg||
nt|blum1956: That way it may be an easy road for the Fredin team|pg||
nt|algraves: Campbell thinking about what to lead that would end in defeat for NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves: probably thinking of leading A of Clubs to try for ruffs, but he has not re entry|pg||
nt|algraves: so something stoggy, no sense losing unneccarry imps in such a close match|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Allan -- do you know what Thurston-Willis are playing in the other room?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|algraves: with the usual bells and whistles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw --   2@H=5+@H, no shortness, 3-4 zz  [A3 K2 Q1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Campbell took a shot because north was known to hold no shortness|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: and so little known about South hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: South at the other table might have (should have?) doubled 2NT, but it isn't clear that he would have reached game even so|pg||

nt|bobh1: often 3N is the best place to go even lacking hcps|pg||
nt|spooky: A brave 4@H bid by South here, but I don't see another bid for south now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty common for big clubber to use "Michaels" rebid in the given auction -- so @H & @C/@D|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|chick: I think you need about 29-30 HCP to make 3N in a total misfit|pg||
nt|sharynr: very hard for Paul to balance here, since he probably thinks his partner has a yarborough|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in Philadelphia |pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if 3 @D was trying to get out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or trying to avoid lead |pg||
nt|bobh1: here it makes with only 22|pg||
nt|spooky: ohoh, 5@C look like a way btter contract than 5@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: the @d suit is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: the North South pair are indeed Austrian... Doris Fischer + Bernd Sauer |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I suppose there is a missing pass from W|pg||
nt|passell: interesting hand slam without a dia lead game could go down with k of dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D asking for 3 card spade support, 4@C splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|passell: hi ralf|pg||
nt|chick: Operator, should this be 4@H in the North?|pg||
nt|passell: in slam percentage to pick up hearts  with the king of dia lead declarer will have to guess hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If decclarer takes a @c ruff in dummy, @hQ will be found easily|pg||
nt|chick: no, but if he takes a club ruff, then can pitch all diamonds on spades|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will lead dia king|pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: no club ruff necessary|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chick: the occasional hand that makes 3N on fortunate lie of cards does make 3N a good bet :)|pg||
nt|chick: does NOT* make 3N a good bt|pg||

nt|chick: Running scores here:  http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|chick: The danger of course is that a diamond switch is obvious if the spade finesse fails, so maybe he will just go for the drop|pg||

nt|spooky: a lot to do for declarer and both black suits breaking badly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: btw - Jokish also responded 2@C   but that was game force relay|pg||
nt|afulton: other than 2@d will make auction easier|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i've always wondered what duplicate would be like if honor bonuses applied|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lml: do you have to have 3-2 hearts.  I dont think so|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sure E is sweating bullets right now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|passell: west could have bid 3clubs instead of 4 hearts to bring 3nt into play|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lml: which is also getting a lot of direct traffic from just about everyone|pg||
nt|chick: opinions vary greatly on how much you need for a negative double, but ignoring a 4 card major to preeempt in diamonds doesn't seem the best approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: 5@C with a club guess or 4@S...will they reach?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the D needed to lead @D's |pg||
mb|3C|an|!|nt|bobh1: i find this a rather strange 1N overcall|pg||

nt|chick: Bidding 1N gives your partner a pretty good picture of your hand and let's him/her make the decisions|pg||
nt|lml: well it is marginal either way and it did avoid the 3-3 in hearts on this particular occasion|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|afulton: if North had @s, wouldn't she bid them after 1@h? |pg||

mb|2D|nt|bobholl: now their @S are lost i guess|pg||
