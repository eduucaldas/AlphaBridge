nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|niekbrink: hi all|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|udo: nice misfithand to start:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: so we have an close match, good for a final|pg||
nt|udo: oh,,would u double ?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: not a standard 3 spade opening by North with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|ziff:  Close. Maybe she wants to stay even with the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: yes, and not a standard x with 12 points and imperfect shape|pg||
nt|niekbrink: and 3nt is an option, but pass was one as well i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: this probably will  go down on a high spade lead|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT safer option|pg||
nt|niekbrink: can't see more than 1 spade, 1 heart, 3 clubs and 3 diamonds for declarer|pg||
nt|ziff:  This will probably go down even on a low @S lead...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed not a fast 9 tricks :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can see 8, not 9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ziff:  Not without N getting in, as far as I can see|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ziff:  If this is asking for count (as it would for me), partner's card will be easily readable :)  Same if it asks for attitude, by the way :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|jeanhari: if north plays 3 high spades and then not swith to hearts south maybe squeezed|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|niekbrink: true|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|niekbrink: club will be enough as well|pg||
nt|ziff:  @D through and @H switch will not be good enough|pg||
nt|jeanhari: true also|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so spade and diamond wil let this trough|pg||
nt|ziff:  50%.. :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: h|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i say 40%, 4 out of 10 cards left....|pg||
nt|udo: why diamond ?|pg||
nt|udo: how does declarer reach the squeeze card,@S jack |pg||
nt|ziff:  @C @H squeeze on S|pg||
nt|udo: yes, @D entry,,i see|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @S jack must be played before diamonds|pg||
nt|jeanhari: fourth diamond will be the squeeze card|pg||
nt|ziff:  Ming Sun giving due consideration to the problem|pg||
nt|niekbrink: right she is|pg||
nt|niekbrink: could be a 10 imp swing|pg||
nt|ziff:  Problem is that W can have so many different hands for the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: small hearts looks a safe exit|pg||
nt|ziff:  Would be nice to know what South's discards meant|pg||
nt|jeanhari: was souths first discard a low (encouraging) diamond??|pg||
nt|ziff:  Low @D, yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jeanhari: but south can know there is no heart length in west so encourage heart was maybe better|pg||
nt|niekbrink: declarer should win in dummy i think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: If Vriend sees the squeeze she must play the king|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no way north can have @D K|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ziff:  Surely N has no other high card for 3@S in first seat|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|udo: hm|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|niekbrink: now it is 1 off |pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|fabsayc: operator the score showing was after 1 segment only|pg||

nt|Walddk10: We are back and all is well|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|bobholl: may be :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: this hand is ugly|pg||
nt|blum1956: Fireman leading from Hampton 86:51 in the ladies play-off|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: strange N didn't show hearts.|pg||
nt|blum1956: she has better spades))|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this double is not clearly penalty, but when verbeek tanks it will be clear to ling|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: looks like old fashined precision with a good lead :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't fancy this one much|pg||
nt|chick: just not quite enough tricks to be had|pg||
nt|mrt2000: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|blum1956: The last double should be mostly penalty|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzsx: HI everyone and welcome to Philly World Bridge Series session 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: all Dutch players here, so I may not understand much of what is said|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: approximately five tricks for the declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 probably|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes six more probable|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzsx: close match 71 to 74 so look for a battle today. |pg||
nt|toral5: unfortunately south CANT get on lead|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek wil make this|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer should play on @D|pg||
nt|toral5: if he elects to play on @H,he ll go down.|pg||
nt|toral5: north just has to insert @H q|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chick: @S10 good return, signal the @H entry|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosmanb: Hi again Sapan|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: sadek will be forced to duck.now defense can play @C ace and back,seting 2@C,2@D and a @H|pg||
nt|toral5: hi osman|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although how N thinks S is going to will a trick is a mystery to me !   lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C a@H a@S and 2 @D is all i hope|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gu should play club king to avoid accidents|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: the @S10 also set up an entry to S hand, but not much use for it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|toral5: sadek is in trouble now|pg||
nt|toral5: @S back now|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it may be 2down :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room same contract|pg||
nt|chick: N still has the spade to escape an endplay|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W has gone to sleep|pg||
nt|chick: what if she leads a heart and ducks S's 10?|pg||
nt|bobholl: north will overtake and cash 2 down|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S will cash to @S and exit with a @C|pg||
nt|chick: (not that this is obvious to the declarer)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry stupid|pg||
nt|chick: if N overtakes and cashes out, it's only -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: open it was played by E which is much better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toral5: he cd stil have made,if he had preserved a @C on table|pg||
nt|toral5: i think he is down for sure|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|blum1956: diamond is best now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might even get out down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it appears lu will get endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: i guess carla will take no risk and cash 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: is it 100% certain that N knows where the @S7 is?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: think so originally 4th best played back|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the carding at trick 2 told N that|pg||
nt|blum1956: suppose Gu Ling played a heart now. Then seven tricks available|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: only a @S is good now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now declarer must win ,lu must cash diamond and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: but now the defenders avoided the endplay|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: you were right Bob, go for the sure thing :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: @C preserving wd have helped.say he wins 2nd @S on table,cashes @H ak,comes in hand with 3rd @S and plays @D jack and 4th @D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: will be a push |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 2 off|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: close but no cigar|pg||
pc|s9|nt|toral5: north is forced to play @C giving declarer an entry to enjoy 5th @D|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|nt|blum1956: a huge mistake by Lu|pg||

mb|1D|nt|uni_cicam: we are back in 3rd session in Match Martens-NIckell|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Stern|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spades seems like a lot of work for 10 tricks in the OR|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H shows 55 an, 2NT asking|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, thanks|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit over strength 2 @H so 6 won't be reached :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C can get fairly bloody|pg||

mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 3NT by Kopecky will come|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@S now?|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|bobholl: brad will surely bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: it is 5@S for the vulnarable NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: He thought about it.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@S on a trump guess and NO @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice treatment forcing 3@C by partner for this hand anyway|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 9 tricks so we can relax in the second board|pg||
nt|chick: N knows S is short in hearts :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: They need to make a right choice between 4@s and 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: There goes the @s guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was about to ask how about trumps whenever|pg||
nt|toral5: now no guess:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: the defence is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT further explained as try for game, single suited...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: test|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 are easy only looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1st board was +2 IMPs for Nickell|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sure, but Kopecky will not have any problems with making it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Good for him to take some time in the first boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: last sessions proved most happend in the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopacky-Kurka are playing ACOL with 5c @S and 12-14 NT, 2 over 1 is 9+|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobholl: 6 @C doubled in other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: should still make 3@S, 4@S would need @h to be picked up?|pg||
nt|toral5: he can make 10|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room -500 in 5@H doubled|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure there is one on single dummy basis|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2@s NF after the checkback|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5 @S migth have some difficulties :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: if @H finesse will be wrong, will be difficult to guess @D, but @H K is on side, no problems for Kopecky|pg||
nt|chick: turns out to be a good save for a small gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: For BBO JEC matches fans, Teodorescu is LeRouMain|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: I think it should have gone for 800 mind you|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 4@S will make but is not completely sure yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep (vriend) will not be sure she can trump the 2nd @H small|pg||
nt|chick: better to trump the clubs and use @Ds as entry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is now, without diamond lead a bit harder|pg||
nt|blum1956: The @cK stays and diamons resolved by the opening lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzsx: cross ruff works well in 5@S, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: South is the one with most @C (almost ) now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|uni_cicam: every player will duck @H K, is there any other line of play?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|uni_cicam: can still loose 3 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: will give ruff :) but nothing essential|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: cant afford to duck @D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess she 'll play Q@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|bobholl: marion has a difficult decision now |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think she ''l play a @C to J but just guessing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|toral5: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now Vriend's turn to think|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is almost as good as @C to 9|pg||
nt|bobholl: if fred doesn't ruff he will never beleieve it :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: believe|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange that he doesn't play for @H to be 32|pg||
nt|anton72: just safety play....what is strange|pg||
nt|caitlin: strange|pg||
nt|anton72: your point |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrt2000: play @DA, ruff @H high, draw trump and enjoy the @Ds|pg||
nt|mrt2000: does that work?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but she needs 1 @H trick also|pg||
nt|chick: I think that leaves her 1 trick short|pg||
nt|chick: @DA, @D, @D, crossruff?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so only way is the a@D Q@H |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|bobholl: @H and @D now :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no, the cross-ruff works too|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even without a diamond lead the Culbertson finesse in diamonds (best chsnce) works|pg||
pc|d7|nt|davidstern: It is amazing how often a trump lead seemingly loses a trcik but comes back in the play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: good guess|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|davidstern: West squeezed?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_cicam: if not cashing @c and play all @H, E will be squeezed in black suits|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  but not always|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not flat board.....|pg||
nt|blum1956: Strong clubbers are usually formal - they open any 16 HCP with 1@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: This one hardly does cost more than 15 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i learned first schenken club, then blue team, which show serious strong hands|pg||
nt|blum1956: The 1@s alternative should look attractive even for the strongclubber|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|toral5: looks like more imps coming for lavazza|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless things have changed drastically since the 2008 World Championships,  NS play different systems depending on vulnerability|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 11 tricks seems a lot.....|pg||
nt|chick: not one that I'd be excited to be in :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S 2nt 3@C i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsx: we will assume 2H is a transfer |pg||
nt|uni_cicam: good 12 possible? :-)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H lead will give 7TH trick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrt2000: true, but I think 6@C will make|pg||
nt|lml: quite terrible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jassem in 4@S west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: 11 more to lavazza|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: dangerous contract|pg||

nt|yvesj49: stange|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 42 @C 32 is around 50%|pg||
nt|fabsayc: greco-hampson used some fancy stuff to stop at 2s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yvesj49: q@c will be better|pg||
nt|lml: but that line doesn't make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract has easy 7 tricks so well done by chinese|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yvesj49: west must count the hands|pg||
nt|lml: diamonds 5-2 you mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but think it's the best line|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is forcing   3@H looks to be artificial saying MORE @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: when ace of @h in south seat|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @C for no  loser and @H for 1 loser makes 6@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: 12 tricks in clubs much easier with a @H lead from E|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: not dangerous -- impossible|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably Q@s in north seat....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: Nickell-Katz use standard signals|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, please give N-S a Czech Republic flag (they are not from Poland)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: do not know it they play SMITH signal, will be handy here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now possisble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stealing 2nd @H is huge|pg||
nt|yvesj49: to have 12 count|pg||
pc|sK|nt|caitlin: hi|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobholl: but she doesn't know yet |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: looking at that dummy, it is a bit surprising Nickell didn't attack @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ducking 1st round of @D gives Martens a losing option next time he plays the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't read them, but i'm told the recently released books authored by Martens are excellent|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @H now she'll know|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes, playing natural methods you probably stop in 2@c which is worse than 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yvesj49: a@d and @d and it's closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: ace surely and end play N|pg||
nt|bobholl: again "forced"to guess good but she (laura) is under pressure maybe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think she'll finesse @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|nt|uni_cicam: ducking second @H is not very helpfull, knowing partner has even cards in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S also relies on @C finesse|pg||
nt|davpro: declarer might get back an imp more here|pg||
nt|blum1956: or in 2@s which also may meet problems|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|davidstern: I like the 4@H bid as, if the opponents do compete to 4@S you can attend to tht too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT is down after taking @H A, unfortunately no information for S, just a try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck could have started with 5@H - and his quick play of the suit put Kurka in doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it would need to be specifically @HA and @D or 2nd @C and misguess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: at least an imp for NS which is also counting|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Meck's play gave defense biggest problems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3/5 leads so no chance to missgues probably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't think 3/5 leads were allowed in that part of the world  [2nd/4th very common]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: trust me, it is :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   just bad attempt at joke|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: it is around 50/50 in Czech Republic between thee leads|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|chick: with 9 tricks now, finessing would be suicidal|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: now @C shift essential -- but @S8 is entry and trump 22 meant Martens would always prevail|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: stange play by west|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|davidstern: So from a 2 imp lead it has now blown out to 17|pg||
nt|yvesj49: strange*|pg||

nt|yvesj49: oopsss|pg||

mb|2H|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: i'll dig out the links if anyone is interested|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: in college we used to play system  Mandatory 3rd seat Opener|pg||
nt|bobholl: red is just points i am told |pg||
nt|davpro: A light opening...NS needs some big swings...in their favour|pg||
nt|blum1956: Does the club lead not put that down?|pg||
nt|blum1956: I mean 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So this could well be another 5 IMPS|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3Nt is working with this distribution, but impossible to get there, or?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: S is passed hand so Kopecky will not force this hand probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play transfers after 1M-dbl|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: we went down a lot in college|pg||
nt|davpro: W can see 4 tricks in defense against 3@d :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will brad double 3@S ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: very dangerous|pg||
nt|davpro: will N only bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe if defense perfect, pitch comes too late|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|chick: wow, pretty ambitious slam in the OR|pg||
nt|blum1956: That is what I am talking on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess we will find out, a critical board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't seen it yet, you can watch live streaming [video AND sound] of one table every set  at  http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 2NT? showing a club suit with a chance for D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Support DBL but it isn't obligatory to show 3 in this situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks like a fredin redouble :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: can they find out their identical distributions ?|pg||
nt|chick: a 3@D preempt by E make the OR auction much tougher|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes we  will see now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: first is not clear to lead a club|pg||
nt|blum1956: North may choose another lead for example|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uni_cicam: oh, was just writing as I know Kopecky, he will take an action, didnt, 2@S it is|pg||
nt|davpro: 4th highest |pg||
nt|blum1956: that's the end of the defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fantoni-nunes took the PHANTOM?! save|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uni_cicam: this can earn a bit more, we will see how many tricks NS will get|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe flat board.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a small gain for holland again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 1 imp|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: west is young player like Marion ?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I seldom pass 8 card suits myself|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is vulnerable so :)|pg||
nt|chick: in this case it worked, but I hate to preempt my partner with a nice major holding like Qxx and a void in the other|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: defense unlikely to get their @H trick|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: E can discard either H or C so might be only 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and goes 1 off in 3DX|pg||
nt|lml: if it is our style to open hands like this vul 3 level then its fine but otherwise partner will expect a real suit|pg||
nt|lml: your|pg||
nt|chick: so I admit, I would pass E's hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be she thinks she can afford a safety play in @H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bobholl: almost i think laura is one year older|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty specs|pg||
nt|yvesj49: very pretty team !!!!!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 down only ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: The fantom save may prove to be not that fantom if you are going to allow the 4@h make|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|yvesj49: hard for young players to play quarter final mac connell|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BBO|pg||
nt|yvesj49: semi*|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion has experience enough :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: interesting play by Lu|pg||
nt|lml: Arnolds might expect hearts not to break and slow down drawing trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=(very good 14)15-17     Jassem knows Nickell has at most 1-q or 2-j|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: surprise|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can go offf now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh doesn't expect the @D to be ruffed|pg||
nt|chick: ouch (for Arnolds) :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps south could have helped with 4@C bid over 3@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky tried to take 2 club tricks before E will discard them, but not succesful in this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd of 4 14-board segments for the Round of 16    the McConnell [women] are in the Round of 8 [Quarter Final] playing 15 board sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Rosenblum will begin 15 board sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: me neither, I wa a bit confused today it is "only" 14|pg||
nt|lml: it was set up by the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: well, with no preempt, no reason to expect an 8-1 split|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: Arnolds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me laura (west i suppose) play bridge since 3 years!|pg||
nt|lml: she should duck|pg||
nt|lml: whatever happens Lu's play of the @HJ is very nice and a lesson to all of us|pg||
nt|mrt2000: game over|pg||
nt|bobholl: if she ducks @S ruff and @H back 1 down |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose Q+J allowed too|pg||
nt|davpro: hte @s-suit will be picked up. So, yes|pg||
nt|lml: she may think a while but I am pretty sure she will play a spade|pg||
nt|chick: and with the known @D distrib, she should worry about that.... W has no choice but to shift to a @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: very unlucky but holland wins imps anyway|pg||
nt|lml: but they reduced the damage by this very good result|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: more confusing will be next set when we start with Board 16  [so same boards as women]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: -1 for 2 imps for Nickell team|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: but lose 400 pts in the process |pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: explanation for her hesitating start|pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_cicam: E is worrying of Spades 3:1|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yvesj49: in fance we call it 'tour de chauffe' lol|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yvesj49: france*|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|davpro: Still, not what NS needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim 1 down|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

nt|jeanhari: club now?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: hi there.  Actually a diamond shift will set up 7 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|lml: 3 diamonds, 2 spades and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi Linda|pg||
nt|lml: it does look the normal shift but perhaps playing percision it is less attractive|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed, therefore spade play was not best.. ok clubs can be bad placed...|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: hi linda|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so another gain for China possible|pg||

nt|bobholl: well played by marion but 1 imp loss|pg||
nt|bobholl: good try :) by N|pg||
nt|davpro: At least they will have their much needed what_is_redouble_in_this_situation-discussion shorly after this set|pg||
nt|davpro: *shortly|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|uni_cicam: with this line, he will loose if @S will be 2:2,but since S was passed hand, was better to go for one down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: EW have a solid card in other room...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: diamond lead atother table gave a trick away|pg||
nt|lml: a blog hand for me|pg||
nt|mrt2000: a nice quiet 4@S here|pg||
nt|lml: it has a Zia overtone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt 4@S i hope|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yvesj49: nice to stop in 2@s !!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vul so Polish Club applies during this auction|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@h only 4 card|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet for some imp's for NS......|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: guess 2@C drury|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: what's the ooops for ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|davidstern: Three level for NS and maybe one level higher for EW|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT obviously was some kind of @S raise|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like a good hand to get a cup of coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: this is the best lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was only 1-round force [not automatic game force]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: interesting hand is coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they play double as 12-15 or strong so they will get (at least) 1 higher|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|uni_cicam: Now N has a @C discard to get rid of one @S|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, few more are still in the hand :-(, let see how Kopecky will handle this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: normal in holland i predicted it|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps coming for lavazza as 5@D got dbled in other room|pg||
nt|davidstern: Havent stopped here yet though|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: you know you are playing high level bridge when it takes 16 bids to get to 2D, but they can bid 7D with 6 bids..  |pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C is 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: just my observation for the week. has nothing to do with this match|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1 off......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 1 ? i guess 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it a second later bob lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4@s is quite agressive|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Marion is in attack|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is a balanced game raise (which I sometimes play)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but why falsecard|pg||
nt|blum1956: small spade is probably the only way to make it now|pg||
nt|blum1956: eve that does not help, sorry|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzsx: sadek asked about 4C, South replies natural |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: then asked about the 2C bid responded forcing. |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south asking about the 3S, undiscussed, but jump should be long spades.  |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|uni_cicam: Now @H to the queen will establish some entries to dummy for playing spades from the declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|toral5: 7 more|pg||
nt|davidstern: Then 14 more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: Hamman played intermediate @S at trick 2 -- i wonder if tougher on defense with Kopecky's @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: trying to recover the mistakes from laura |pg||
pc|sA|nt|uni_cicam: sorry @S from DUMMY|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzsx: then join us at the bar:)|pg||
nt|toral5: 7 more i meant as imps for lavazza on this brd:(:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah but 7 more boards as well|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||

nt|bobholl: no safety play nneded for @D now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|yvesj49: the best way to loose imp's....|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: hard for KOpecky now, but he should be sure E does not have a K|pg||
nt|blum1956: the defence takes 7 tricks earlier|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: kool @SK from Meck to get tap of dummy going|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrt2000: true|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: lack of one entry to cross ruff and end play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quite normal for laura to have an hesitating start, but i'm sure she will recover her spirit !!!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: it was easier in the other room|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H-1@S-???    2@S, 2N [@H raise], 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice @S play |pg||
nt|davpro: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: they didn't notice :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Lavazza took a while but starting to put the pedal to the metal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: there was a director call on the 3S bid we may need to adjust the last board. |pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|chick: or perhaps one of the pitches was actually not a @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @C or 1@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|uni_cicam: doubling 4@H in Open room was risky, but might earn few imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess multi so 2@S now|pg||
nt|lml: you might overcall diamonds on the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Good hand EW make 4 either major while NS have good save -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: But EW have to judge|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now NS will probably buy the contract in 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: West maybe thinking about 3NT!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C has four possible meanings, most of time 3-10 with diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: lots of questions now.|pg||
nt|blum1956: It could be pass-3@d-3NT-pass-pass-pass if North opened 3@d, making eight to nine tricks|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D    5@Cs possible; 11-17|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S always for me|pg||
nt|lml: while you only have 5 they are very chunky|pg||
nt|lml: and it is lead directing on occasion|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope they don't get too high may be if arnolds bids 3@D now they will|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so much for that guess Al |pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobholl: this will win some imp but not enough|pg||
nt|blum1956: back to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So spotlight on Wesy|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: nice lead, underlead @S Q can get the extra trick for defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: although vriend hasn't got anice card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: delicate enough this contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: too delicate they already made it in the open room|pg||
nt|lml: this ones deserves some thinking at trick one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense will need early shift to spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 4 rounds of @D is just enough to beat 4@S  -- but   wow|pg||
nt|blum1956: so North-South need to switch to spades on the second trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davidstern: So duplicatd result here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told when exactly 4@D & 5@C  max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martens' pass stopped me from asking if they could land in 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play gazilli :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@h by east is weak opening ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: probably|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i promise i learn dutch system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: earlier looked like 2@h is hearts and a minor|pg||
pc|dT|nt|davidstern: Anybody for a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I was wondering what the lead was at the other table...  |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes will now make as declarer will finesse spades pitch two diamonds and only lose 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think laura should have bid 2@H but not sure |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sry, i thought you meant opening 2@H.  here would deny 16 points I think|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty|pg||
nt|bobholl: best with open cards is drop a @H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it will make if verbeek wins and continues diamonds now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: 9 will look migth high so @H back may be|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lead at the other table was @DA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: the other room is only on Board  6  so we won't know for a while if Zia-Hamman can get to [correct] game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yvesj49: north missed to play K @s|pg||
nt|lml: best to let Gu in one spade I suppose|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yvesj49: now east is in comfort|pg||
nt|lml: she cant really tap|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh but I think she can|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: Yes - the @d9 lead could not be from 3 small I guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_cicam: But, could have also give the contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yvesj49: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: club lead one off....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not obvious dfor south|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H much better contract |pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: pass 1@s a good bid for me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: who hs the Q of @C that's the question |pg||
nt|bobholl: has|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Larry Cohen would have balanced with 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since 1@H=4+  Kurka using some form of checkback -- but with 4333 many wouldn't bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to find @C lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they have only 8 tricks so ?!|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is like pushing a lot of breath out|pg||
nt|blum1956: 25 points, plenty of Aces but no resonable game|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: sorry  3@D was typo|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe max 1@S bid with BOTH decent @S AND @D support??|pg||

mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: hard to lead a @D now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - was 2@C game force?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there may be a compound squeeze if defense does not attack hearts early|pg||

nt|bobholl: they made a lot of tricks in open room |pg||

nt|yvesj49: but 9 tricks whatever|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not look legitimate i agree|pg||
nt|blum1956: whichever suit East leads (outcide trumps) this will beat the contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: @D and small @C is too suspicious :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: Nickell-Katz unlucky to go down in 6@H on  4 where Kurka-Kopecky made 6N  for a 17 imp swing|pg||

pc|hA|nt|uni_cicam: they play only one check back, old style ;-)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well this wasn't best choice either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H7 lead is 2nd/4th   i.e. lead LOW from doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree 6N was better -- just saying unlucky that 6@H went down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|blum1956: and certainly no squeeze after that|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yvesj49: probably overcall 1@h in south|pg||

nt|mrt2000: think so?|pg||
nt|lml: yes hard to get to dummy and just cashing the @HA is a logical play for -800|pg||
nt|lml: playing spades first risks spade ruff anyway|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think the only way to keep EW out of game is for Martens to PASS throughout|pg||

nt|lml: the heart lead did not cost|pg||

nt|caitlin: 16 boards today? I have lost track|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|lml: sorry no|pg||
nt|lml: off two tricks!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another hand where NT  range forces different opening bid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: showing 15-17 balanced now|pg||
nt|bobholl: thougth 14 but 15 possible too|pg||
nt|caitlin: 15|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 6@H is COLD|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the best or at least potentially most succesful here is a heart partial NS|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|othered1: Nobody's holding a gun to your head to open 1N with south's hand, even if in range|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3@C and 3NT will come|pg||
nt|lml: not a spade and a diamond?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: n|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no, just a @D|pg||
nt|lml: right lead up to the diamond for spade discard ... yes|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I REALLY didn't like the 4@H bid from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: yes, but 3@C is a check back|pg||
nt|bobholl: who is driving who too high ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS lot of @D losers ew lot of @S losers|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think she will sell out here... lets see|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|oosmanb: 2@H was by South probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and as expected they land in 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes 2H was south|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 2NT could have been a strong hand with solid S suit also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milan - what would Kurka open with 4@S333 and 15-17 points?|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, 4@S is a very good spot, that couldn't be found after 1N opening, at least not with other room's methods.|pg||
nt|caitlin: 60 boards a day........this is an exhausting ride to the end|pg||
nt|bobholl: S double was support (3@H)|pg||
nt|blum1956: They hardly will find one|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@H artificial|pg||
nt|davpro: 1@h was not @h|pg||
nt|caitlin: X takeout|pg||
nt|bobholl: but double was 3@H anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible these days|pg||
nt|blum1956: still 2@d is OK|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: many Precision players say 1@H is forcing -- not sure if it was here|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT just balanced 15-17. 2NT can be even 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsx: if I try to correct it though you may miss the whole board.. sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 1h showed 4 diamonds.|pg||
nt|lml: this goes for 500 anyway|pg||
nt|mrt2000: EW really haven't got to grips with this hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: going to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: failure to bid 2@C suggests 1@H could have been 4@H with longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|lml: the worst thing about 6@C is it just might push e-w to slam, probably not now|pg||
nt|lml: ok|pg||
nt|blum1956: and 3@d may go down|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: No need April thanks you're doing a fantastic job!|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: rusinow leads my favourite   www.bridgeguys.com|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: dbl can help, but @C lead is still obvious, will Kopecky guess right?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: just 5@D with this hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: take it back my bulgarioan help made mistake|pg||
nt|caitlin: their variation|pg||
nt|caitlin: np!|pg||
nt|lml: good job rising|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzsx: thank you.. I appreciate your help!!!  and support :)|pg||
nt|timmy5: grant me permission|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: you all are doing a great job too!|pg||
nt|timmy5: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@S!!|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the winner once past 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: if they can stay there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: needs a bit too much for 15-17 for a slam|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: Since this is such an important match, declarer will try a pseudo squeeze and try to ruff two @D for a miracle|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very tough hand |pg||
nt|othered1: if south's @SQ were the @CK slam isn't bad at all.|pg||
nt|davpro: 6 tricks for defense...that can't vanish|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: NS play Precision when not-vul  Polish Club when vul|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: Hi Taymour welcome|pg||
nt|timmy5: hi Oosman|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: east trying to figure out how the heck he won this trick and what trap the declarer is trying to set up for him...  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT might be a warning bid, anyway here we go|pg||
nt|othered1: Will be faced with same position Hamman misguessed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: tough decision|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm curious, can kibitzers send me a personal message whether they'd play this deal all the way through or just claim -1 and move on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H was  no 4 card in MAJORS.. and 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should be played like rubber bridge, draw two trumps and claim|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: 3@C than 2 down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|timmy5: ill play :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm told 3NT was bid by Pharmaservice, Thank you Mh. Shaker :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As I was saying, for us mere mortals 3NT seems hard to find, but at this level all 32 teams ARE capable of finding the 9 trick cold game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I had pharmaservices this morning.  a very nice pair from Denmark...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: and it has to be N who needs to convince South (due to the 4333 and AA Kxx @H)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: the defence only needs to cash a heart|pg||
pc|d2|nt|uni_cicam: but, if they try to get a ruff, probably they have it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|uni_cicam: this will take a while|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: taking by A is winning also againt 4th @D J on side|pg||
nt|othered1: do those good @D spots in dummy have an effect on the decision?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: so yes, they might|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: play the Ace Michal, please :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think this is anything other than a guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck would play the same regardless of who holds the @DJ   and maybe even with @C33|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, I have an option, put 2 cards on the table and hit them. The one which jumps further is the right one. You will be surprised how it works|pg||
nt|lml: they will get the spade eventually|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: YES|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzsx: talking (in Dutch) and laughing|pg||
nt|lml: because West has a club|pg||
nt|lml: so safe now for 500|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|uni_cicam: sorry for being one way oriented, but I am trying to handle with the excitement. I would rather sit at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when North's @C length is known -- Rod doesn't have to give true count|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|blum1956: From the declarer's point of view  East should have a @dQ if both club honours are with West. Lu did not show her @cAK but this allowed Verbeek to play for the extra chance that ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: West has a third spade. Suddenly the @dQ appeared|pg||

nt|chick: China needs more than 1 IMP a hand to catch up though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for a strange push|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: i agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10 4@S in the other room, so Hamman-Zia need to find the ruff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: NV upgrade to prevent vulnerable manche :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: multi landy |pg||
mb|1N|nt|uni_cicam: that might encourage NS for other boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=7-11|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess minors with better @D ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: marginal 1nt overcall but probably the popular choice|pg||
nt|blum1956: The 1NT overcall is OK while 2@c may put the East-West into trouble|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 3@S = splinter   support @D, short @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive double|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In OR, the weak NT got nailed for -100|pg||
nt|bobholl: we are not afraid game :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4 card overcalls back in fashion I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I can confirm out of the 32 teams with 3 instances to go , ONLY team pharma has found 3NT, WELL DONE. (btw par was 4@DX-1 by EW :) )|pg||
nt|lml: not too worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: key now -- is Katz PASS forcing?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not sure to win 1NT.....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good view @h|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is indeed ok if it does not show more than a normal 1nt opening|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: the range for 1N response is higher than standard because if 1@D opened with balanced hand it is 11-13 HCP|pg||
pc|dT|nt|timmy5: 3nt coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough is enough |pg||
nt|lml: Arnolds doesnt have extra |pg||
nt|chick: EW are playing precision, so the 1@D is just a generic opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mrt2000: there's a good start for the chinese recovery|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps South should have just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry lost contact for 10 minutes or so|pg||
nt|lml: rather than inviting|pg||
nt|chick: the other room didn't get the W hand opening, so here S may have worried that there was no good source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: well the 1NT response from north suggested diamond help|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: which apparently yan treated it as|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|bobholl: than they may make (when doubled)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: I dont see a 2NT bid here, unless rdbl followed by 2@S was forcing|pg||
nt|timmy5: i didnt see a 2d too|pg||
nt|bobholl: agressive 1@S too Vulnerable|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with such a suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: was that a suit ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @s for the ace and 8@h ?|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 1 off only|pg||
nt|bobholl: now good chances :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not good but some|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if they play precision imo|pg||
nt|lml: at least xx|pg||

nt|bobholl: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i guess she did|pg||
nt|lml: nope... not even the last 3 cards|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|lml: she had a squeeze and holding the last club couldnt be right|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: another lead problem|pg||
nt|chick: so now we have a real tight match|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is only four way bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either major weak, strong balanced or strong with diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: The popular convention after multi (if 2@d is multi) is to bid 4@c now asking partner to bid a transfer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Then not possible I guess|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: those strong variations do create complications in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: certainly|pg||
mb|3D|an|alert|nt|vugraphzsx: I will try and do better at keeping up..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 400 up for grab here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Hamman got his @D ruff on  10 for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Kurka respond 2@C or 1N in their  version of Acol?|pg||
nt|stc: solved in OR|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: got right in the Open room|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2 over 1 is 9|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 9+|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this is going to be painful|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davpro: I predict that EW will not end up in 4@h...especially not after that 1@h overcall....I could be wrong though :)|pg||
nt|glen: 1NT might be transfer to @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: 300 now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ENGLISH STYLE.......|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: confirmed by my bulg help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not only are they not especially good on the strong hands, they restrain responder on the weaker ones|pg||
nt|blum1956: I prefer to play 2@d as "weak two in either major"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yvesj49: best contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N was forcing  i'm told 3N=2542|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: @S or @D?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: @D are better that is the help for these leads|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in frnace 2@c north 2@h south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: france*|pg||
nt|bobholl: this result is better :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|mrt2000: but likely a flat board|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S and a@D at least |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 3@D was minimum, seems 3nt not systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is the segment 1 of 4  for the Round of 16   there are 3 more sets of 14 boards today  [10/10/10 in some parts of the world]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was disappointing conclusion to the auction|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: seems Meckstroth know this and hit it right|pg||
nt|lml: well east will have four spades and a diamond in a sec|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Walid will like that first trick|pg||
nt|lml: and that should be all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north does not have a max for me, only 1 quick trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: bulgarians in other room were not disturbed so bad performance|pg||
nt|blum1956: Clearly South will be not much happy to see that kind of clubs opposite her singleton|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yvesj49: happily in france we have a lady team.....|pg||

mb|4S|nt|uni_cicam: thanks everyone, will be an exciting last session, hope organizers will put it to the schedule since we did not see second session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure yet which matches will be on vugraph but with this match so close, won't be surprised to see this same matchup|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: and, please, give greetings to the Czechs, everyone is watching and holding fingers|pg||
nt|bobholl: 16 imps on 1 board is a lot |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  not vul    maybe they are playing Polish Club throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then i thought open 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes!|pg||
nt|lml: the OR result looks normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no still looks like Precision but slightly different range|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 12-14 nv I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for 4@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is possible with the same guess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: quite a flat set with some chances for swings, Nickell has biten 11 IMPs from the Martens Pie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator -- please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and thank YOU for the great job|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: is 5@D a bad contract?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|blum1956: the boards were not that exciting this segment, still there were some interesting points of technical nature|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzsx: 1  over trick only, my mistake.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_cicam: if E is taking @H K by the Ace, there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|timmy5: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I wouldnt mind being in it, (or actually putting partner in it)|pg||
nt|othered1: But doesn't south have to take early discard if he runs all the @C?|pg||
nt|lml: an autobridge hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: and then telling him "you couldve made you know"|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @C finesse now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|uni_cicam: from Kopecky view, double squeeze should work, but will be turned quickly to simple @S @H squeeze|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: think netherlands will loose 1 or 2 imp on this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @HQ then a @S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: K@S ruff a @S probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok That's it for this set|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Roland whens the next one?|pg||

nt|timmy5: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: next match is about 40 minutes...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sorry these guys were playing really fast and covering their cards.  Not so easy on the viewgraph ops...  |pg||
nt|othered1: which threat does he throw now?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uni_cicam: should have played @H K first, now he realized |pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: was an exhausting set for taking such sqeezes, better to save energy|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fokal: I guess since she doesn't much entries and because she need 2 tricks, she will play on @hs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|udo: yes, @H looks normal|pg||
nt|fokal: she doesn't have , sorry|pg||
nt|jeanhari: playing spades first...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: netherlands canb only loose on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: can|pg||
nt|lml: and they guessed the spade|pg||
nt|chick: that bid has Arnolds' jaw dropping|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit weak in @D for 2nt|pg||
nt|lml: assuming they start with the diamond ace|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|yvesj49: 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bobholl: missing two 'aces' have to guess it rigth|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: EW play Polish Club I'm told|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Hi all we are going to have some fun here tonight.  |pg||
nt|davpro: Perhaps, but still the best bid (imho)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: By our very soon Dutch correspondent , van Spoookyyyy, aka Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|oosmanb: own*|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|chick: W may lead the @DA and thereby give away the fact that she has the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: trump lead beats|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: a fredin redouble |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think as jeanharings that they won't bid it missing two 'aces' as i said before|pg||
nt|blum1956: only 3 imps to the Netherlands up to this moment, the Chinese coolecting 31|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
nt|davpro: a blind lead somehow. Didn't hit the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult and costly lead problem (@DA could be my choice)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
nt|yvesj49: possible to play on @c !!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well she knows they have 11 @S but :(|pg||
nt|chick: doubling for a lead doesn't make a lot of sense when you will be on lead against a slam|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
nt|davpro: Moss might be concerned about @d 3-0, but in that case S would probably have led trumps...so he should relax :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: it scares them off :)|pg||
nt|lml: at this vul though East might have cooperated in diamonds with a different hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: begin with @S is bad :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: she did'nt put the 10 ??????|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: I like to play that double as a suggestion for a save|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||
nt|spooky: hi Jean|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen up more staring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|chick: that would make more sense to me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yvesj49: OOPS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no ten|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yvesj49: incredible|pg||
nt|bobholl: laura is playing bridge not long (3 years or so)\|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6430 possible?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oosmanb: probably wouldnt bid 3NT with that! :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: Just for my Australian friends watcching: Ish/Ash 61.61% Nye/Bobby 55.62% Michael/Stephen 53.5%|pg||
nt|yvesj49: now it's 1 off|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry but I have been receiving so many requests for pairs results|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot of ways to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no problem David. We like to hear results!!!  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably quite nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well some coming here to make things interesting|pg||
nt|blum1956: finally something essential for the NS team|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: so keycard is a bit of a nuisance on this hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobholl: true :(|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yvesj49: will be better the other segments|pg||
pc|c5|nt|caitlin: hi again|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|davidstern: No way to avoid 11 I would say|pg||
nt|davidstern: But of course declarer doesnt know that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: Now he will|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is getting harder and harder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: J@H discard will scare him alot|pg||
nt|davidstern: North Pitches a heart the @C10 may come into play|pg||
nt|spooky: even if North discards @HJ he still has no choice does he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should be OK @HK pitch last spade and club honour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well he can try ruffing @H high|pg||
nt|davidstern: But this would be down if North held @CA10x|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and then playing another @S|pg||
nt|spooky: did you see another line David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could just play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Leave all dummy's trumps intact|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lots of entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That would work too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway did well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: but your trumps in your hand are quite bad...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I can see the wheels turning in their heads..  we could be in for a long night at this rate. :)|pg||
nt|spooky: so a possible overruff with @C10 is still there|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I am off leave you in very capable hands. Most of the matches are close to conclusive but one or two still in the balance|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he means your hands Spooky|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|davpro: rehi|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jeanhari: must be :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: this was terrific|pg||
