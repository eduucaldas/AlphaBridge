nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: you are funny Hedy... its good to have your around|pg||
nt|marlowepi: font know their style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've just started board  13 so we'll have to wait|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C for me with that shape. seldom any insurmountable pressure where your major is spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: discussing last auction.  bidding showed minimum HCP but extra shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-3@C from Nystrom?     their 2N opening is @C & @D but with 12-15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: worst relay in the system...  laughter|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: an anemic overcall|pg||
nt|bobh1: trading on the colors i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Linda :) i love it and guess it shows..also fun with you!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed Marshall -- no reason not to show the real distribution  but some 5-card majorites ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: so this is a stolen bid situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes even good pairs play "stolen bid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: most of those majorites burn to a cinder before they hit the ground|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel can't sit, can he?     for that matter -- can Nystrom?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Mustafa and Phil|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: in the other room East (Baxter) didnt defend quite as well as Sementa.  he failed to keep an exit card|pg||
nt|lml: the British Lions are first in the E division|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: these two teams had a tough battle earlier  just one imp|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT by W on a 9@d lead in OR last bd|pg||
nt|lml: I mention this because Paul Gipson blogs and he has been giving me a hard time about ignoing him|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: it is quite unexpected|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this can make if he knows the heart situation after queen or jack wins  first round|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzsv: nystrom, comment <should be some useful cards there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: S might have explored 3N as an alternate spot|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: I hope he does well... I have my favorites|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: i guess he can make this too|pg||
nt|hedyg: dpnt we all?|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont*|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: about the last board specs have been pointing out that they acution was different in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: West didn't have a chance to support hearts and it made it hard for East to unblock|pg||
nt|lml: yes the LIONS have a bye this match but that is only 11.5 VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H fixing trump, 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff comercial.  Check out www.bridgetopics.com |pg||
nt|hedyg: 11.5 is an usual score for a bye, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Lauria requested a restroom break...  id offer to fill in but...  :)|pg||
nt|lml: yes but some people suggested the LIONS were helped by it... don't really think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol April|pg||
nt|lml: after all this is over I am going to start reviewing bridge websites in my blog.  There are so many new ones.|pg||
nt|lml: Van Cleeff has one of course and several others|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know if Van Cleeff is on facebook, bridgeblogging is of course|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: maybe bridge is coming into the modern era|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|xenya: 7 top tricks -- maybe there's an endplay available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: N was hoping heart JT would be doubleton. but EW would still have the tempo|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kittyc: BridgeWinners is on facebook too, they are running a contest each day to pick Rosenblum winners in KO stage|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: this is actually going fairly well for declarer despite the bad diamond break|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, silly of me -- @SJ is 8th |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: but what's the harm in @S first?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: thanks Kitty|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chthonic: But things are not rosy for NS  Nothing splits and QD offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Zhao fondles his bidding box with apparent indecision|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Should wind up in 3N or possibly 4S. |pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Now Fu rubs his face|pg||
nt|dburn: Fu has quite a lot of extras, but no clear bid - maybe 4NT is natural, but I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: North seeking inspiration and guidance|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what prompted him to bid 2@s and not 3@c - maybe he was trying to save space, but now he is seriously cramped for room|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, he has not shown extras so far, and would feel guilty with 3N.  And as suggested, 4N is probably not natural...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: all the discussions on bidding systems and carding was in Mandarin, so I do not know the meaning of any alerts :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, 4NT it is - maybe that's natural (because he could have cuebid if he wanted to set hearts)|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may not seem that way to South, who will take it as keycard for hearts|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems to be an ace asking response|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Miao does not put out a pass card and just points to it as Fu pushes the board through the screen|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|dburn: but Fu has to guess at some contract now - he may just give up on the whole business and blast 6NT or 6@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: againMiao just points to his pass card and the board is pushed through|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsu: Fu is quietly explaining the bids to Miao|pg||
nt|chthonic: this won't fare well.|pg||
nt|dburn: ...he didn't; he chose a diamond to be active, and that will help|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: no lead yet, my chatting put the lead on the table :)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, OK|pg||
nt|dburn: @d10 would be a super-weird choice - my money is still on a club|pg||
nt|chthonic: would seem an odd lead against 6NT.  probably a club looks least harmful on auction, ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Miao is hunched over, but he knows that the partnership is under time constraints because Hou could not be found|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, as David suggested -- that seems best|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chthonic: well...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: mind you, East does not have the most obvious of opening leads - I guess he will pick a club to be passive, but...|pg||
nt|chthonic: well, that lead helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: everyone is talking aloud in Mdandarin|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he went for a different diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzsu: Fu grimaces|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|chthonic: Can make if finds spades... |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chthonic: nope|pg||
nt|dburn: he can, but I can't think of a reason that he would|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: all are impassive|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: north south are arguing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: loudly|pg||
nt|dburn: would have been a good idea to be "impassive" - that is, to take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems an appropriate reaction to a disaster to me!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: I am guessing that South thought N had 6 spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: for spectators who are asking me what on Earth I am talking about, the French word for "finesse" is "impasse" (and not, curiously, "finesse")|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chthonic: A very gentle strong club auction in other room stopped at 3NT|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugraphzsu: Miao fingering different cards|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
nt|tokay1975: just 1550|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if he  made   5cl  they win 12  instead of losing 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: just like we were discussing earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew not used to having ONLY ONE long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Had to join you, you looked lonely:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tokay1975: tyyy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: play for 3N facing many modest smatterings|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: this was a real football game.  We started with Cayne running away with it and Auken shaky|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil confidently reached 6@C|pg||
nt|tlc: on 14?|pg||
nt|andersk: the first board was not good for BRAMLEY, had a huge upertunety, and missed it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- yes 14 was bid to 6@C  after natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tokay1975: his judgement  was  very good i thk to bid  5cl |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Anders|pg||
nt|tokay1975: note that  giorgio  duboin bid  4nt  and they were ,in 5h impossible to make|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the last board for now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tokay1975: i prefer also  4nt but i am not sure which one is  better |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: the movie says that 6@d made in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: then Auken got a few good results and the momentum shifted.|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you April, great job @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: thank you Linda :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andersk: I like the 4 NT bid too. But Im more conserned about the line of play from this room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now jack of hearts maybe? |pg||
nt|andersk: small @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened an Acol type 3N|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  if he can make  4cl tricks he is safe  thats why i thought he will play jack of hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|lml: I wonder if the score is correct in the CR on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: they fixed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set scheduled to begin in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bobh1: they just changed it to -2|pg||
nt|lml: 6@d was down|pg||
nt|lml: a big blitz|pg||

nt|chthonic: passed out in 2?|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: 2 @H it is as the director was in here talking about 2 boards in 14 minutes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzsu: I do not know the nt range and was talking to the director about the speed of play |pg||
nt|chthonic: I am not sure of the range.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East-West play a strong club maybe that was a weak no trump, but I am still unsure why West acted as he did|pg||
nt|chthonic: The pass indicates a lower range, and a spec suggested it is a normal precision NT, so 13-15|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: now Miao is muttering to his pd and he is told that the contract is 2 hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting to open S hand 2N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
mb|4H|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||

nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||

nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||

pc|sA|nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||

nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|nt|andersk: If @H is 2-2 it will be ok to play @S after 2 rounds of @H  The problem is: What to do with the 100% @D switch, wont help to run it, so only 1 line left: @C A onside|pg||

nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
nt|bt: not a classic 2bid but effective here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: decent 3N here for n-s but unmakeable with the club ace in the east hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4d is one heck of a bid in that spot in my opinion|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
nt|bt: its a little aggressive imho|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I like the dbl either.. prefer 2N even with those lousy heart spots|pg||
nt|bt: 2n is a slight underbid, so i understand the double|pg||
nt|bessi2: but with only +50 or 100 defending 3h on the menu.. -100 in 5d surely nothing to be concerned about|pg||
nt|bt: this is heading for one down unless west gets stuck with the @C J in some variations|pg||
nt|bt: @S A, @HA @H ruff, diamond, @H ruff diamond, @S, @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n asking question of e|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
nt|bt: then on @C to king west can unblock|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|d4|nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
nt|andersk: When you take out 1 NT X, you have already shown 6@S and a weak opening, why do partner bid 3 @D if not force?  I|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|stc: yes|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|blum1956: Pepsi should be Jacek Pszczola, the World Champion|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bessi2: but the legitimate way to make the contract is for declarer to play west for ax in clubs|pg||
nt|bt: north forgot to unblock @D9, beer card not important in china?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: ok  safely done|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to allow for 4-1 break in both black suits|pg||
nt|lml: the rules are probably somewhere on the wbf site or maybe easier to find on ecatsbridge.com|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bessi2: anyways.. 99.9% certain Lev will unblock club Jack if it comes to that|pg||
nt|bt: now north knows 55 in east|pg||
nt|bt: if theyre in rd of 32 they know|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer tries to go for the misdefense here then he doesn't know Lev well I should think|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c2|nt|gulyas: a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|lml: no double squeeze|pg||
nt|vicky888:  no communication|pg||
nt|lml: south cant be squeeed |pg||
nt|lml: he has no winners|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: needed to cash the @CK for that, and that kills the communication|pg||

nt|bt: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: =64|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||
nt|andersk: would you rather bid 2 @D than penalty double 1 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: not very exciting in a team match, I have to admit|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a disappointment for North   |pg||
nt|bt: so north played to respect the opps as opposed to the more likely lie and a misplay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||

nt|stc: not the percentage trump handling here|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv:  we saw what happened in the last round...  |pg||
nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||

nt|xenya: N's @H9 may be a big card|pg||

mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|dburn: age-old dilemma, this - should 3@h be forcing or not?|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: but this is the modern solution - play transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: first Zhao took out the 3@H card and then withdrew it after alerting|pg||
nt|dburn: but the ultra-modern solution is of course for your partner also to be playing them|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsu: Fu did not alert the 3 @D call to Miao|pg||

nt|dburn: other way round, I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chthonic: Wow.|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Not that it will make.... |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it won't make, and maybe Hou could have risked doubling it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: the director is called as apparently u just remembered before bidding 4 @H|pg||
nt|chthonic: I was about to say that if North bid 4D, South might be constrained by law not to correct.  Unauthorized information, but 4H solved THAT dilemma|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Fu just remembered the convention when he bid 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Miao asked that the director be called|pg||
nt|dburn: there are screens - South has no unauthorized information|pg||
nt|chthonic: Oh, yes.|pg||

nt|lml: he can always raise diamonds|pg||

nt|bessi2: surely the only 2 options I should think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 1NT seems possible...yep|pg||
nt|andersk: This should be an easy 4@H  If they bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 20 a moral victory this set for Bramley squad|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no one seems able to get hold of this match  chance for EW to bid a slam here|pg||
nt|bt: 4@C is more succesful here but i am stubborn :-)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|petepunt: tough to bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: he'll wish hed supported Diamonds now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  i m not sure 2d in place of 1n would show the strength he holds|pg||
nt|lml: a surprise lead|pg||
nt|lml: but actually diamonds is the better spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably Lev was too conservative|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3@dX may bring 800|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@C is my choise|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asked from 4 Y|pg||
nt|lml: he chose to open a lead directing club rather than his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand was nightmarish for EW -- think we can expect a minus from the other room as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@h now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andersk: 4@H is righthanded now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: this can be defeated and probably will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get to 4@S|pg||
nt|andersk: only 9 tricks if played in W with a @C lead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry about that |pg||
nt|andersk: Jxxx can be enuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you need luck|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to trust partner|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|mamos: we would have expected them to bid that|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|andersk: what would partner bid with: xx, 10xxxxx, xx,xxx?|pg||
nt|bt: so the cautious 4@C was a winner, i predict a few imps for mahaffey here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c7|nt|lml: North has to sort out that they can cash clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have done better to cash top Club at trick One before playing Heart|pg||
nt|vicky888:  it is inevitable now but to cash two top clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
nt|lml: actually it is a link to swan bridge|pg||
nt|lml: which has the running scores... either place will do|pg||
nt|petepunt: lev only has worjking 9 count and east cant really mve over 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe the safety play in trumps here is !K, then small to the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: will likely play K@d and @s to the Ace, following the opening by S|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreements but in this same auction, 4@h without blinking... I'm not sure why E didn't bid 4 with present hand|pg||

nt|andyv:  well, if his pd had simply an invite hand, he'd bid 3@h... his 3@d says he has an even bigger hand... now QJ10xx is a great suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: game is comfortable, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after 1@s by S good from any hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  last point... I'm sure they play lebensohl, so E hand is already limited to less than 8 hcp |pg||
mb|4N|nt|bt: one philosophy is to find the right suit as opposed to the right level|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: now these don't fit as well|pg||
nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petepunt: 1Â¬C shows 11-16 on this auction (1516 )|pg||
nt|lml: this will be quite a challenge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@H EW  - diamond lead gives a few problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you would be right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even by East - it doesn't matter after the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see a way to make this but lets see|pg||
nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is a very good contract but will fail unless declarer has x-ray vision |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|bt: so the lead will tell south who has @SAK, then a club finesse and the !K is placed, what is east doubling on??|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  with 6 tricks off the top, declarer should make his contract, thus another swing for Lavazza team|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a @D after 2 trumps ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: but still.... extremely tough to do I think|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited as to how to play the hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||

nt|gulyas: looks like 8 tricks from top, and maybe a slow @S winner, but he may not get there|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S??|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry for the delay, I can only see 1 side of the screen.|pg||
nt|vicky888:  definitely getting penalized heavily|pg||
nt|petepunt: another 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: weak no shape or strong|pg||
nt|xenya: intermediate 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S shows a good opening bid. |pg||
nt|lml: fair enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pinot Noir are leadong Apteker 30-0 and are in second place |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: are they about to be rescued|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some discussion, i cant hear|pg||
nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
mb|2S|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||
nt|lml: these guys have played together forever so they probably do no what it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: yes suit not strong, hard to read writing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: N thinking about Christmas|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bordeline balancing 3@C i think|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: 4@s from E is very easy if W showed opening values|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  this auction gives W a much better view of E's hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: and 6+ @s's|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: EW  are likely to make a fair gain in any case|pg||
nt|stc: and eastern in the same time|pg||
nt|blum1956: Weak NT working!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Should've been thinking about his lead instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: looking like 800|pg||
nt|blum1956: The innocent 1@d opening with the North hand would have costed NS a lot |pg||
nt|blum1956: as compared to the weak NT|pg||
nt|stc: Weak NT is war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: punch thinking about the whole hand, not just this play|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe k@S or 8@S is the choice|pg||
nt|stc: not best lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  and still couldn't get to game|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c3|nt|petepunt: 800 on @C lead only|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blum1956: two hearts, one spade and some number of trumps|pg||

nt|mamos: you arrive as EW have a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Richie would just bid the cold 7NT|pg||
nt|reisig: shld be easy to reach 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||
nt|yuval10: won't be so easy to beat this one|pg||
nt|mamos: im having connection probs   sorry everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: who likes 3N??/|pg||
nt|reisig: HATE IT|pg||
nt|mamos: not me|pg||
nt|reisig: But --- Huston will bid more|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C is 16+ so S looking ofr possible grand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's contradicts Bird's law|pg||
pc|c6|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer will need to guess spades for his contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yess!!!  RR|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
pc|c3|mc|9|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bt: and west will lead a club, given east did not overcal 1@S hence no 5-suit there|pg||

nt|xenya: i must confess i don't understand this defence |pg||

nt|bt: but 5@C is a posility|pg||
nt|bt: possibility|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer probably ducked one club then let the jack of @s run.. looks like the best line to me|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I have had a number of messages saying that a diamod switch cannot cost - probably not |pg||
nt|xenya: E could duck a heart -- but if he wins he should try to find a few quick tricks, not to set up the clubs with no entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I'd open that East hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you lose a club you still make 6@C  .... and go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 6-4 is very strong (w 2 aces)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks in Hearts|pg||
nt|lml: so like in the previous match a good start and then the mo switched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c = natural or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he would have done better to cash clubs first, hoping for an error |pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to restrain himself with this hand|pg||
nt|bt: multi 2@D saving east from a pemaly D in 3@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder if south had a penalty dbl available... either way I would pass|pg||

nt|blum1956: Lev sitting with @h@s 55 and 14 HCP and listening for 1@h-1@s))|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stc: EW may cash the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: slim chance though|pg||
nt|mamos: wow that double is some call|pg||
nt|mamos: what is North supposed to do|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  2@h an overbid as N has already denied 4 @hs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: no   4@h seems completely normal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, but I would prefer to look for a 4-4 spade fit first|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk5: Smolen auction perhaps|pg||
nt|reisig: BUT - if partner had KJx in @s -- we have slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you don't have a spade fit, you can get to hearts later|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|stc: and will get a second chance|pg||
nt|lml: they have 25 hcp so 2nt vul might not the favorite|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. many aggressive players would open 3@s with this hand, though I am not one of them|pg||
nt|bessi2: Cohler at this point delighted to be playing only 2@h|pg||
nt|bt: the flaw for a weak 2 is the void and playability in 3 suits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andersk: will lead @S now|pg||
nt|bt: and the flaw of the multi w @S is they have a comfortable 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: as long as they are not forcing declarer a lot in @Ds, he can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  read map has been given to opps|pg||
nt|andersk: Sadek will use the J to get the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone agree with N's 1NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it does help to know your partnership style with these borderline hands|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4-1 trumps could be a problem otherwise|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  N should play |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with 1 NT, however I would bid 3@h instead of 2 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s|pg||
nt|andersk: sometimes partner have 5@D 4@h and sometimes 6@d 5@H|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe they can overcall 2 NT with 65 in red's|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: @H more likey than a low @S here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: low @S should be automatic|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably East should have discarded clubs in the reversed order|pg||
nt|stc: can you beat on @hs ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: showing the spade values|pg||
nt|stc: at IMP @s looks better to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: aagree easts @C should enc in @S if poss|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: he has a good chance of making this I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  I think S had a simple 2@d rebid... he has a decent hand, a very broken @d suit and needs a lot of help from partner for any game|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bessi2: well that was a very good counter-move from south|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: but it must be easy for West to work out the underlead anyway|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: You could even have a 5-4 spade fit, and 6-2 in hearts, as I assume they open 1NT with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|reisig: He didn't even try for @ss|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: 3N has little chance on a club lead (and careful defence thereafter), but 4@H appears to be cold on this lie|pg||
nt|bessi2: nice defence from south|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  even lose 3@ds here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petepunt: e/w world champs so must avoid dbl dummy analysis here|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@d here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e passintg notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  4s makes on all leads rt|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl as responsive here|pg||
nt|bessi2: he had even more information after a Majors overcall from west and a voluntary 4@s raise from him aswell and also easts dbl of 5d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk5: Operator, please click on MOVIE on your toolbar, hold your mouse over board 25 and overwrite  4HW+1|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd Pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|reisig: I hate partner getting more involved|pg||
nt|stc: and the down side of weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Board 25 corrected, thanks|pg||
nt|yuval10: will S XX this?|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt he wants to play here|pg||
nt|lml: who knows what happens to 5@H|pg||
nt|dburn: East may bid anyway|pg||
nt|lml: well we do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will bid that, probably|pg||
nt|dburn: he does have four decent hearts, after all|pg||
nt|lml: so if north passes and East bids 5@H what then|pg||
nt|andyv:  or simple 3@d:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: ew might take first 10 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|stc: however hard for E to put the K@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  styles matter.. in OR, N bid 1@d and S was able to show his values.  Both rooms reached same contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|gulyas: they cannot open up both @Cs and @Hs for the defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's X is quite dangerous, given the fact his Partner is the only limited hand in the table, when he already passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q|pg||
nt|bt: 3nt 600 ...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: well sorry I think NS got to the contract they deserved here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trump lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk5: On this auction dummy rates to be short in spades'|pg||
nt|mamos: it probably won't turn out too badly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 imps on  24 - 4@Cx made EW next door|pg||
nt|lml: this is no fun if you are for Canada ... where is the match I came to watch|pg||
nt|lml: think I am going to get a beverage, I need something... brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "Hope I've got enough" |pg||
nt|yuval10: they started well, until Deutsch responded|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: if @s played from dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: will -1190 be a good result since NS has 1430?  i think not, it isn't so easy to discover the 6@s |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|reisig: I guess this isn't one of those ...draw trump and claim hands|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|stc: looks like .2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q@D dropping N should make this|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @ds aren't 2-2, this hand is not making so finesse for Q should not be an option.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: too early to worry, Linda -- this will lose to 6@S if bid in the other room :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: you hardly have any trumps to draw|pg||
nt|reisig: EW|pg||
nt|reisig: @h is a standout ..now|pg||
nt|stc: -2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petepunt: may esc with -1 now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Some would rebid the chunky spade suit, but 2@H could have been right|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@S isn't exactly laydown - what does North do with his fourth diamond?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Gold and Townsend are talking about the last hand.  Gold, even if you respond 4S the auction isnt going to get any better for me. |pg||
nt|xenya: will have to take a @D hook it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: over 4S that is... |pg||
nt|lml: I think they should be quite happy with 1190 plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok we are all back now. |pg||
nt|xenya: the King is arked with E of course|pg||
nt|xenya: *marked|pg||
nt|andyv:  our 2nd push board|pg||
nt|bt: now south has an interesting hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: horrible result for n-s.. however I don't feel either player did anything awful in the bidding.. only the 2N bid is questionable but reasonable in my opinion|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|reisig: maybe should change that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: alerted, but no explaination|pg||
nt|bt: 2n was aggressive but unlucky|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gulyas: fun fact from bd 25 (where EW were 4@H+2 both room here):|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike this 1@h bid though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: the boards have not been as spectacular by and large as yesterday 3NT looks ver straightforward here|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary plays Hampton|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary down 800 in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|bessi2: a clear 4@h bid imo, |pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: awkward for South|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting to see how NS will handle this|pg||
nt|bt: if it is permitted in their system its fine, other options are worse|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: 1nT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton down 1400 in 5@Dx...|pg||
nt|blum1956: the club slam is makeable here but neither easy to bid nor to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i like 1@H in a perverted way|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
mb|4C|nt|reisig: 1N seems "normal|pg||
nt|mamos: oww|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S doesnt  seem ormal|pg||
nt|mamos: normal|pg||
nt|blum1956: the heart slam is clearly down|pg||
nt|stc: yes, you can't discard loosing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N is lebensohlish no doubt|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|bt: you dont want to open 2/3/4@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|reisig: Maybe ...they are getting warmed up|pg||
nt|mamos: practising 4-3 fits obviously|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to come up with something interesting:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: According to the NS CC, South could have doubled 2@c to show three hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: perhaps it isnt the boards its the players :)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  now, thts the action table|pg||
nt|bt: but u want to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: typical acol auction here,  11 tricks looks likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e asking question|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  fine contract and result in OR for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely tempting but Cohler cant do more than 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South could have doubled to show 3@h, is his pass alertable? I don't know|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 25 - EW in the other room made 3NT , quite unclear how from the movie, it looked like a sure -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: north should have a yarborough on the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: he is suprised|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|reisig: We all have different overcall styles|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stc: 6@c make in dd, but the percentage play is to take the @h hook and go down|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|nt|lml: I am told the 3NT score IS wrong so things are better than they look|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|d2|nt|reisig: As long as we both on the same page ..it's OK|pg||
nt|isp: 140|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton still leading the match (and the group) tho|pg||
pc|dA|nt|isp: 170 was wrong|pg||
nt|reisig: They are GREAT at claiming|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|lml: still cant get on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H by Moss looks an off-the-wall bid to me|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mamos: Poddar leading this group|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: Fredin in 4th with two strong US teams inbetween|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: that is a 17 imp difference .. loss of 10 to win of 7|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW have stolen the hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: and would put this at 4|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, perhaps he was trying to disrupt NS's bidding -- but it seems he chose the wrong time |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: "Service Unavailable" -  the web site must be getting a bit of a hammering|pg||

nt|mamos: of this set -- two more stanzas today each of 14 boards   lots of excitement this week|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You just have the entry, @SK, to advance @HJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing a spade, a heart and a diamond|pg||

nt|bt: ns carding not efficient|pg||
pc|c2|nt|reisig: For me - @ds would be 4-1 and have to lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA onside (good chance), West with Kx in hearts and diamonds 3-2|pg||
