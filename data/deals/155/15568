mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|caitlin: Balicki Zmud w Cayne, no??|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: y|pg||
mb|2D|nt|algraves: so Duboin and Sementa play a 11-14 balanced club and a 18-19 balanced 2D|pg||
nt|algraves: and the rest very souped up standard|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: Gitelman and Moss play very standard|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzsu: Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: The Italians rarely let an opportunity to overcall at the 1-level go bye without getting into the auction.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: EW make 5@S  in practie and can make 6 with a double spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|algraves: so this will be 3 down if the fullness of time|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|algraves: so a usefull littel postion for the Italians|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi again|pg||
nt|algraves: 500 into 650 |pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: hi Bill :)|pg||
nt|othered1: but wouldn't you take 500, just in case all that bidding might have been based on lots of shape.  Unusual for it to go that way with two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Moss is thinking|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|caitlin: full house here today|pg||
nt|algraves: oh of course, this is par result but the other table still has to bid to 5@H|pg||
nt|algraves: sometimes , bridge being bridge, the humans dont behave as expected|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Technically, perhaps par is 5@S|pg||
nt|reisig: ahh ..I never heard that before|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|algraves: earthlings are an unruly lot it seems|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes par at 5@S but I would expect most EW pairs to take the money as they say|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|algraves: rather than push on in an 8 card fit when they dont know how good their diamond fit is|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|reisig: Some -- may not overcall ...1H|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
nt|tokay1975: just 1550|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussions between the norvegians|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: nice bidding |pg||
nt|caitlin: This should be a very interesting match: Greco/Hampson are very good and aggressive.....Duboin and Sementa are very experienced international players|pg||
nt|caitlin: and very successful|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
nt|stc: very good judgement in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|tez: hi sgurbjorn:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|caitlin: I suspect it is Duboin who is thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
nt|caitlin: wrong!|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh OK|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Joe our operator:)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N EW looks a reasonable effort vulnerable -- whether it will be made is another question|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if he  made   5cl  they win 12  instead of losing 14|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 11 tricks in NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: just like we were discussing earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew not used to having ONLY ONE long suit|pg||
mb|p!|nt|andersk: Had to join you, you looked lonely:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ellen|pg||
mb|p|nt|tokay1975: tyyy|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: play for 3N facing many modest smatterings|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|ritong: hello bill hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Phil Clayton|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: this was a real football game.  We started with Cayne running away with it and Auken shaky|pg||
nt|tez: @s  lead 12|pg||
nt|stc: a sqz @s/@d could bring number 12|pg||
nt|tez: i guess @d lead|pg||
nt|phil:  hi all - on a touchy laptop at daughters swim meet but will try!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|caitlin: 6 sure tricks is what they start with|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil confidently reached 6@C|pg||
nt|tlc: on 14?|pg||
nt|andersk: the first board was not good for BRAMLEY, had a huge upertunety, and missed it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|ritong: hiya phil|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- yes 14 was bid to 6@C  after natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tokay1975: his judgement  was  very good i thk to bid  5cl |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Anders|pg||
nt|tokay1975: note that  giorgio  duboin bid  4nt  and they were ,in 5h impossible to make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: this is the last board for now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't want to see any bad breaks here|pg||
nt|phil:  hi dude|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i prefer also  4nt but i am not sure which one is  better |pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: the movie says that 6@d made in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: then Auken got a few good results and the momentum shifted.|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you April, great job @H|pg||
nt|stc: the communications are not very good for the sqz |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: North thinking|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: thank you Linda :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Sepan|pg||
nt|toral5: sapan.hi caitlin|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|toral5: brb|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hampson will suspect the singleton heart from the auction -- no NT opening|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tez: need finesse @c |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andersk: I like the 4 NT bid too. But Im more conserned about the line of play from this room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now jack of hearts maybe? |pg||
nt|andersk: small @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened an Acol type 3N|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  if he can make  4cl tricks he is safe  thats why i thought he will play jack of hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: @c, AKQ@h, @s finess, it works|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: I wonder if the score is correct in the CR on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: they fixed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set scheduled to begin in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bobh1: they just changed it to -2|pg||
nt|lml: 6@d was down|pg||
nt|lml: a big blitz|pg||
nt|lml: congratulations to the Rayner team and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|lml: I hope I can be watching both in the finals!|pg||
nt|bobh1: thx all c u later|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: see you later. thank you all!|pg||
nt|lml: thanks to the operator who was outstanding|pg||
nt|lml: really great job April|pg||
nt|bobh1: agree|pg||
nt|lml: thanks Bob|pg||
nt|lml: bye now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  OR returned @c at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores |pg||
nt|andersk: S has to continiue @C now otherwise the @S can be good or @D trick|pg||
nt|andersk: or 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: tempting to use the Queen, but actually no need|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tlc: thx all for letting me join the party..a wild bunch of hands!|pg||
nt|andersk: 3x@h now and @C A @C to 10 @S will endplay North|pg||
nt|phil:  did we get the result on the appeal?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 75 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's over now|pg||
nt|bessi2: but will he take the spade finesse |pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: Thanks Hedy it was fun and thanks Kitty and April the wonderufl operator|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks specs for joining, we hope you enjoy the show|pg||
nt|lml: and thanks to BBO and all the spectators|pg||
nt|lml: I love BBO Vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: be back later.  thank you all.  |pg||
nt|lml: bye|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  small @h to board|pg||
nt|andersk: risky, since North might have Qxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
pc|s6|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: for tomorrow's schedule with your local times   http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i did not|pg||
pg||

nt|algraves: even if North does not overcall south will usually find a way in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Sementa and Moss laughing |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|algraves: we have all the news|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|algraves: 4@S down on normal spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: i think Sementa said YOU MAKE 6 spades|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|algraves: but double dummy could make as you can play that spade combination for 1 loser|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Not odd, however, to get trump lead on an auction like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: well west is on lead and wont lead a @S|pg||
nt|othered1: but not from that side|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Fred asking Duboin questions about the bidding|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@D E-W last board closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: and now thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: some more questions now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: are you 44 in diamons and spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Duboin said yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: nice guy|pg||
nt|algraves: Duboin has no bridge reason to get the @S right but stranger things have happened if he gets a feeling and is 30 imps down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: can you take an inference from non-trump lead?  But why the right one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: probably Fred asked too many questions|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lml: he|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: and good morning|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|stc: Our two teams are 3rd and 4th separated by 1 VP|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up for Lavazza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South has quite a hand|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: and an opening |pg||
nt|xenya: after the 1@S overcall by S 3N had very little chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Precision 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4414 or (43)15 shape|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was different some decades ago|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it was a bad lead though|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting use of rdbl|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting to open S hand 2N|pg||
nt|tez: unlucky 6@d|pg||
nt|toral5: back|pg||
nt|xenya: probably support double from N|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes alerted as such|pg||
nt|toral5: heading towards an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya:  aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: by NS|pg||
nt|caitlin: so 2@H raise of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: transfers after the D, so RD = hearts, 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|phil:  I like "4415" shape....less one|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhere|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cute|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Normally a game bid and won at both tables, with players with theese skills|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
nt|toral5: seems supp x is mandatory in thr methods.opened with less than 11 and now a supp x|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: very tricky, splits not friendly for NS but good finesses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably South knows which by now ... sand has a decision to make|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
nt|ritong: mysterious bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He goes for the spade game ... rather than 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
nt|tokay1975: is morgan thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ok its free  :)))|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to his partner:)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: his pd  has 4 aces with 19  count and still his hand  cannot mnake 5|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even 4 is  problem that  cl ace in onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@D might well be the "end signal", meaning: "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
nt|tez: makebl 6@d with open cards..but...|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see any scenario where finessing in spades is the right play|pg||
nt|stc: but to make 6@d you need all finesses !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will just count on diamonds 3-2.. ruffing one spade and discarding one, intending to give up the K of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
nt|toral5: an expected push|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A common technique in the relay community|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: sure, this is the normal line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the board came very quickly back to South...lol|pg||
nt|tez: pelle bid good IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now some more thinking|pg||
nt|tez: 5@D= i have nothing|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure what south is considering.. grand out of the question at this point and passing 5d is unthinkable|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe not unthinkable.. his pd could have kqjxxx kqxx in hearts and clubs i suppose|pg||
nt|tez: we are sure camberos will try 7|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 4@h/@s would be encouraging|pg||
nt|phil:  but South should play this and put the hand everyone knows about on the table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: perhaps, depends on their methods.  It's quite a cool concept which can be used in any system where one player is in control of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: w thinking|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||
nt|lml: Solani is sort of endplayed but he can get out a spade|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if a strip and endplay is the best line|pg||
nt|tez: nice bid|pg||
nt|stc: on non trump lead the @s finesse looks ok, why not|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps a 4@c bid from camberos would have been a better bid instead of 4@d.. gives his pd a chance to bid 4@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|stc: on this lead some chances|pg||
nt|stc: but you have to choose the right side|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead auto|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|Walddk5: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|tez: he cant lead singleton trump in this squence|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: bathurst is going down with the diamond offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry these guys are fast. |pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D seems a good result here|pg||
nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||

nt|bjacobs: not quite, I guess|pg||
nt|phil:  I think K@c would have worked no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And perhaps he should have done so ... it's pretty much the only chance|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|othered1: They say Gazilli handles east's type of hand well.|pg||
nt|reisig: now ..two ways to raise|pg||
nt|algraves: defense would need to get 2 @S and 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: i do not know what the ruling was|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 2@s -- best...and 3@d|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|othered1: Why alert 3@D?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Gitelman-Moss play 1N can be opening hand|pg||
nt|reisig: Because ...had another way to raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: i think Fred alerted and Duboin asked..Fred gave a written explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsu: Moss thinking now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Isn't that -- 2@S -- just bridge?  though I agree with alerting anything that may not be obvious to opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 3@d = whatever happens now ..is your fault :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Sementa asking now...he did not pass yet|pg||
nt|algraves: so to make 3NT EW need to get the @C going before the defense gets its long spade set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@D= invite whereas other way to show forcing @D support|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Sementa thinking now what to lead|pg||
nt|algraves: and the defense has two chances to lead spades , opening lead and after winning first club|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is not a favourite to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: stil thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: @s 8 or 6 is kinda normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: now Moss bringing water for everyone|pg||
nt|algraves: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: lol|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: Anyone know if 1N tends to deny 4 biddable @S in EW methods?|pg||

nt|lml: I am quite happy to walk in and see Canada is leading|pg||
nt|andyv:  did I miss something?|pg||
nt|andersk: Can East have 5332 with @C A and pass opening hand, and W not bid with AQJxxx in @C?  I doubt it, so E need to have a @C honor, then surely a low honor|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: sorry specs we do appear to have tech problems here|pg||

nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
nt|bt: not a classic 2bid but effective here|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: accepted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see. North is on lead to 3NT and will probably lead a spade|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: decent 3N here for n-s but unmakeable with the club ace in the east hand|pg||
nt|phil:  (undo)|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: boring hand now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That gets declarer up to 8 tricks, but I can't see a 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4d is one heck of a bid in that spot in my opinion|pg||
nt|tez: q of @h|pg||
nt|xenya: this might have issues...|pg||
nt|xenya: but makes perhaps if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin will start with his natural @H q|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
nt|bt: its a little aggressive imho|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I like the dbl either.. prefer 2N even with those lousy heart spots|pg||
nt|bt: 2n is a slight underbid, so i understand the double|pg||
nt|bessi2: but with only +50 or 100 defending 3h on the menu.. -100 in 5d surely nothing to be concerned about|pg||
nt|bt: this is heading for one down unless west gets stuck with the @C J in some variations|pg||
nt|bt: @S A, @HA @H ruff, diamond, @H ruff diamond, @S, @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n asking question of e|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
nt|phil:  lost a valuable tempo|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One tempo gone - there better be a spade switch coming!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
nt|bt: then on @C to king west can unblock|pg||
nt|tez: ty:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
nt|toral5: @D q10 falling are also gud news for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes -- i missed that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|toral5: looks like a comfortable make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco asks about count signals|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|mc|10|nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
nt|phil:  430 or 400?|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: playing for 4 @H|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|algraves: no that seems a guess when nothing happens on ace or king|pg||

nt|lml: This is group J|pg||
nt|lml: 4 in each group|pg||
nt|mamos: Im still stuggling to nderstand North's mistake on the previous board  any ideas  why he went wrong?|pg||
nt|andersk: Andy..pls|pg||
nt|bt: true|pg||
nt|toral5: we do have a super match|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: =64|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: as I said at the beginning|pg||
nt|toral5: i missed tht:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whichever, it's a colossal disaster|pg||
nt|phil:  hard to see the spade disappearing but ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: 1 s shows 5|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||
nt|andersk: would you rather bid 2 @D than penalty double 1 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh.another 500 in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: not very exciting in a team match, I have to admit|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a disappointment for North   |pg||
nt|bt: so north played to respect the opps as opposed to the more likely lie and a misplay|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||
nt|andersk: Im told: EW play xfers at this point to show a weak hand or 12+...rdbl is always limited to 10-11|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: though at least he wont be too high which might have happened|pg||
nt|tokay1975:   walid knows for sure  this is forcing he just took the risk with weak hand  .both opp showed some values|pg||
nt|tez: seems 5 card @s..bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against 620 i guess|pg||
nt|phil:  Hampson taking delayed auction with that awkward hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you told South he could make 5@C, he wouldn't believe you|pg||
nt|phil:  think 2@c is natural in this context?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: its clear he thought @h6 was singleton but this was misguided|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will be an easy +620 for Lev|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greco/Hampson great pair and aggressive but Duboin and Sementa have far more international experience|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this hand will play quite well for north|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d wenz down in OR on the same @h lead !|pg||
nt|xenya: as Ellin said, NS are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S?  Beam me up, Scotty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vicky888:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c checkback, but I believe not GF|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps for @D team|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: S seem to upgrade his hand|pg||
nt|andersk: next time 3 NT is cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 6@h making but not a sort of perfect contract|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s does make on the previous board of course|pg||
nt|stc: @s now|pg||
nt|phil:  and they land in a Burns fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 1@S seems panicky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: ruling stands on appeal|pg||
nt|phil:  since double is takeout of hearts, why cant 2@c be natch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's as if he is unaware of E/W's system, where 1@C can easily be a 2-card suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: playing small @H on board 18 seemes strange|pg||
nt|lml: apparently crazy things are happening in the OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx, however, doesn't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, rather, shouldn't|pg||
nt|lml: the OR is in 7@C in the other room but they aren't finished yet|pg||
nt|lml: they are all on steroids|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: www.bridgeblogging.com has the scores. |pg||
nt|bessi2: club ace.. cash 2 spade tricks and revert back to clubs only way to bother declarer it seems|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  this contract appears to be super safe...CR in 3@s making|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bt: i am a big fan of preempting in spades, but i am not sure if it is correct on this eau de cologine hand|pg||
nt|tez: do you overcall with helgemo's hand?|pg||
nt|stc: what about a 3rd @s round ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: or a 3rd spade even|pg||
nt|phil:  you have a q of 2@h on the offchance South has a hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|andersk: I would prefeer to trust my partner instead of my opponents|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tokay1975:   this is true he just took the risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I think that EW have played a few times and pretty much know their system:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: they have doubled 7@C in the OR so we should have a pickup for Canada|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, i retract -- W didn't double 6@D -- he bid 7@C instead|pg||
nt|bt: cologne|pg||
nt|caitlin: no X is big plus for Diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortunately, with the very friendly position, 2@S may scrape home|pg||
nt|phil:  lead advertises clubs as 2-2 (or 4-0)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's funny - E/W are playing trumps to stop South from getting ruffs.   Little do they know!!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|tokay1975: they have been playing together for years|pg||
nt|toral5: we have a new leader now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gulyas: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, N is on the wrong wavelength|pg||
nt|bessi2: but now it will make comfortably|pg||
nt|stc: small defense error(@c before 2nd @s)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos thinking|pg||
nt|tez: bi-color hands are very valuable after finding a fit|pg||
nt|stc: here the fit is "moderate"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still thinking|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: I know East-West and they are pretty sensible |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt certainly helped their cause here -- in a sense|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: in this sequence, there is no fit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: and now i wait for the questions? lol|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: we shouldnt see too much mischief from them|pg||
nt|mamos: on Bd 17 the most interesting answer refers to North not having any clear alternative action|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: well, 7@cx is a bit on the naughty side |pg||
nt|toral5: turning out to be a first few gr8 brds for @D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: "No spades partner?" asks North|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: not the percentage trump handling here|pg||
nt|andersk: Im getting mixed comments from specs regarding auction on the previous hand, however IMO 3 @D looks forceing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they won cavendish  i thk 2times and lots of success in usa nationals|pg||
nt|andersk: I beleve East too a gut shot by passing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and also best pair of  egypt they are very experienced players|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv:  we saw what happened in the last round...  |pg||
nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||
nt|andersk: Reda is telling me RD is unlimited and Elahmady took a chanse passing, I trust reda, he knowes these players better than all of us together:)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|petepunt: need good wriggle after a weak nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: often 4! and 4 card suot |pg||
nt|lml: yes the momentum can certainly change but this is a very steady east-west pair|pg||

nt|mamos: the only swing so far was on Board 18   a real monster  - East at this table made a real error in defence of 6@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@C and 4 higher|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 5@C|pg||
nt|toral5: greco will probably bid 3@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|stc: weak NT produces interesting situations|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good vul game and it will make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly mmisfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with no particular fits this hand is headed to 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry corrected now|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 NT good/bad now?|pg||
nt|xenya: S needs little from N for 5@C to be a good contract|pg||
nt|phil:  4@s has problems on a heart lead - otherwise skates home|pg||
mb|2S|nt|blum1956: anyway 2@h looks like a standard contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT again|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they will try for more|pg||
nt|stc: last spot to go +|pg||
nt|andersk: I like this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for north.if he dutifully bids 3nt,@S suit is exposed|pg||
nt|xenya: just 4 cards in clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Studied understatement Phil - on a heart lead it looks doomed|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: nope|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S would have been down 2 on best defence|pg||
nt|toral5: same contract in other room?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I like your caution - good commentary technique|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: just not many tricks |pg||
nt|tokay1975: just made 2nt |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes same contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: not very exciting again|pg||
nt|lml: this is a coffee break hand for sure|pg||
nt|stc: 6,7 @s are good cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Cunning lead. I believe Drijver did a similar thing against Bocchi some years ago in an Olympiad - Bocchi got the suit wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Teatime in England :)|pg||
nt|lml: Results from this event are at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|yuval10: declarer wasn't fooled by the lead|pg||
nt|tez: i mean..he played without any hope|pg||
nt|toral5: should 3@D on 3@C be treated as forcing?or ONLY 6-5 better hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: not forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil:  Bill I have said so many wrong things in VG that I couch everything  (except what I just said :))|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: 3@H cue is stronger bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H was almost GF|pg||
nt|xenya: at least N had no difficulty bidding 5|pg||
nt|toral5: @S ace not known yet.declarer does have problems|pg||
nt|xenya: if N happened to have an ace, he would have cuebid, then S bids 6 i think|pg||
nt|toral5: may be if he leads @S now,@D finesse will be marked|pg||
nt|toral5: in lieu of sementas 1@H opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: though with 3rd seat opening, no guarantees|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: my friend points out:if 3@H is near gf,wt is 4@D suppose to be on 3@C?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: might be key card for some pairs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, ditto|pg||
nt|phil:  out of the blue double? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt this contract is actually doubled ... so am expecting a flat board|pg||

nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil:  well they did walk it into 4@s...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: 6-3@D fit can be easily missed playing auto keys in the form of 4@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: i think 2@s GOES 1 OFF BUT would age them 10 years in def!|pg||
nt|tez: he is very good player|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: Gold must have seen the DVDi|pg||
nt|lml: Thurston and Willis in the OR are also very steady players.  Not spectacular but few errors|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how declarer can get to 10 tricks here -- well, maybe with a little help from the opposition...|pg||
nt|xenya: N's @H9 may be a big card|pg||
nt|mamos: no may about it  :)  it's a BIG card|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm talking double-dummy though -- down 2 is not out of the question|pg||

nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||

pc|s6|nt|andersk: what would partner bid with: xx, 10xxxxx, xx,xxx?|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: North has to sort out that they can cash clubs|pg||

nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreements but in this same auction, 4@h without blinking... I'm not sure why E didn't bid 4 with present hand|pg||

nt|tejjyid: can only bid 6 with mirrors|pg||
nt|andersk: I also agree 3 @h, but I will never risk pass witW hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if his pd had simply an invite hand, he'd bid 3@h... his 3@d says he has an even bigger hand... now QJ10xx is a great suit|pg||
nt|bt: cashing @DA would have been costly if east holding was T97 ...|pg||
nt|stc: I have 7 red cards and 6 black ones, an omen to lead a red :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: risky doesnt need that finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: my fault -- no practice finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: next slam for EW|pg||
nt|andersk: every day partner have 5  card+@H a game is huge favourite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, 7 imps to Bramley as they break into the scoring column|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3h is exactly shows 4 card heart. 3dia maybe less then this  with 3|pg||

mb|d|nt|bessi2: I dont like that support dbl at all|pg||

mb|2C|nt|petepunt: 6@H by west is good|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: game is comfortable, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after 1@s by S good from any hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  last point... I'm sure they play lebensohl, so E hand is already limited to less than 8 hcp |pg||
nt|ritong: lots=8, but with his "hand", is not that bad|pg||
nt|phil:  2@c alerted?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
mb|r|nt|bt: one philosophy is to find the right suit as opposed to the right level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: now these don't fit as well|pg||
nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tez: i love support dbl:)|pg||
nt|phil:  @c + higher perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: xx alerted|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petepunt: 1¬C shows 11-16 on this auction (1516 )|pg||
nt|lml: this will be quite a challenge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@H EW  - diamond lead gives a few problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you would be right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even by East - it doesn't matter after the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see a way to make this but lets see|pg||
nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they just point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: and write notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is a very good contract but will fail unless declarer has x-ray vision |pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D could be 2+|pg||
nt|bg: 2 H good treatment shows 5-4 weak in majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: we'll be awash with coffee |pg||
nt|bjacobs: tough call for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  :)|pg||
nt|phil:  sotm x? |pg||
nt|ritong: in good company, pointing means " it s artificial", displaying the alert card means " beware it s highly artif"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and he finds a choice that no one will understand, possibly including himself|pg||
mb|3D|nt|toral5: helping lead for hampson.trump lead wd have been interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can just imagine Sadek thinking: "what the hell am I meant to do now?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he wrote a note|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|bt: so the lead will tell south who has @SAK, then a club finesse and the !K is placed, what is east doubling on??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: thinking is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: picked up cards and looked again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: looking at your cards is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they did not change|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: best to be on the safe side|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  with 6 tricks off the top, declarer should make his contract, thus another swing for Lavazza team|pg||
nt|caitlin: I gather Pietro Forquet is in spec......pls join us commentating|pg||
nt|toral5: queens are co-operating wel here|pg||
nt|bg: if he happens to cash AK Dia and Ak spades he will make 4|pg||
nt|toral5: wlcm to the legend pietro forquet;and my favourite bridge player:)|pg||
nt|toral5: dont think he can make 4.1@S,1@C and 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|tez: if there were just one right, we would all play that|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a @D after 2 trumps ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: but still.... extremely tough to do I think|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tez: that's why bridge is great|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited as to how to play the hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||
nt|stc: HH are putting pressure on each board, very hard to play against them|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: now it remains to make it|pg||
nt|mamos: ok this will be interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: but not quick I guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I wonder about north's 4N bid.. could surely be a big winner but with 2 aces including a singleton ace on lead...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|nt|vicky888:  so the only action brd till now is the first brd tht i missed ..yawn |pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, pretty much boring hands so far|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|algraves: so west made a spec double of what he thought was a 4-4 fit as he has a singleton and ran into a 5-5 fit|pg||
nt|algraves: unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|algraves: 790 and 5 imps to diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: 21H a weak raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Moss thinking now|pg||
nt|algraves: you know Moss may " kick this in " as they say and have a go at game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: he will bid 5c...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: he did not yet... i was just specutaning|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: speculating|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: still thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: could be off 3 major suit tops|pg||
nt|algraves: if he can see all freds values outside of hearts with the key finesses through declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: he asked sementa about 2h bid and was told weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsu: :(|pg||

nt|gulyas: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S??|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry for the delay, I can only see 1 side of the screen.|pg||
nt|vicky888:  definitely getting penalized heavily|pg||
nt|petepunt: another 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: weak no shape or strong|pg||
nt|xenya: intermediate 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S shows a good opening bid. |pg||
nt|lml: fair enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pinot Noir are leadong Apteker 30-0 and are in second place |pg||
nt|bjacobs: tough call for West|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i d vent 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: asking for a stopper - has merit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: spreading and closing hnad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: another possibility is 4NT, committing to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: each one of these plyer do something diff|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: are they about to be rescued|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some discussion, i cant hear|pg||
nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
nt|tez: very diciplined 3@h opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: good thing screen up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but he goes with a more cautious alternative ... 3@D is probably a constructive bid (using Lebensohl for the weak hands), but is it enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@h in this vuln|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 6N|pg||
nt|toral5: kibs saying 6nt in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: just open www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: 6N is superiour to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||
nt|lml: these guys have played together forever so they probably do no what it means|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzsv: yes suit not strong, hard to read writing|pg||
nt|stc: Nunes passed but he also landed in 4@h !|pg||
nt|tez: fantonies dont play weak 2|pg||
nt|bg: looks good to us but how to play at table?|pg||
nt|toral5: both 6@S and 6nt is dependent on guessing @S queen|pg||
nt|xenya: or not -- sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: N thinking about Christmas|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bordeline balancing 3@C i think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: 4@s from E is very easy if W showed opening values|pg||
nt|caitlin: South African transfer|pg||
nt|toral5: how superior?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction gives W a much better view of E's hand|pg||

nt|algraves: of course we are completely objective|pg||

nt|othered1: If 4@D specific to majors, @C suit isn't necessarily all that good.  And things often don't split .. . |pg||

nt|caitlin: nice X|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: that seems about right|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a favourite after 3@D opener|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|algraves: so he will think about 4-0 trump offside and the Q of hearts offside|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: waiting for Moss to play|pg||

nt|algraves: well he knows now that one of the majors is breaking well|pg||
nt|caitlin: why would Moss think......not going to play King|pg||

mb|5H|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||

nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||

nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South hasn't got it, but he thinks @SJ10xx is enough?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: i would not|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
nt|toral5: no game makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 2@H was invitational|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards are 2@H also has a lot of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bt: and west will lead a club, given east did not overcal 1@S hence no 5-suit there|pg||
nt|ritong: no key missing, pard enthusiastic  let s go|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sadek is not happy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: bleh|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
nt|tez: helness didnt like q of @d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||
nt|stc: On bad day you find Q10xx@s behind|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says he can make..but we will see:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 3N|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sadek's majors are death to him|pg||
nt|ritong: he opens the bidding, gets a grand in his er...face, and knows everything goes well for opps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gotta say, this was highly speculative by North ... how could he know that his losers in diamonds and hearts would all be covered|pg||
nt|ritong: pard said " i like my hand", and he has no reason to hate his|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But should grand slams be bid on the basis of "I have a nice hand"?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: as any other spot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vicky888:  the openeing 2@d is weak?|pg||

nt|gulyas: looks strong to me:)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  but that opening has caused this non-sacrifice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||
nt|lml: tough defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now, the nice play of @s to the J paid off in the end, even when it virtually costs a trick at the beginning|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: but more good days than bad days here :)|pg||

nt|bt: but 5@C is a posility|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: 4 boards to go...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: more than 10 imps per board...big ask|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer probably ducked one club then let the jack of @s run.. looks like the best line to me|pg||
nt|bg: s/b a routine spade partial|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: best defense was to lead trump and play trump...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: action here|pg||
nt|tez: what do you open with S'S HAND|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: I have had a number of messages saying that a diamod switch cannot cost - probably not |pg||
nt|xenya: E could duck a heart -- but if he wins he should try to find a few quick tricks, not to set up the clubs with no entry|pg||
mb|2C|nt|reisig: I'd open that East hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you lose a club you still make 6@C  .... and go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 6-4 is very strong (w 2 aces)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks in Hearts|pg||
nt|lml: so like in the previous match a good start and then the mo switched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c = natural or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he would have done better to cash clubs first, hoping for an error |pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to restrain himself with this hand|pg||
nt|bt: multi 2@D saving east from a pemaly D in 3@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder if south had a penalty dbl available... either way I would pass|pg||
nt|bt: say 2@S-3@H-D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: h shows s|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|stc: Lev wondering about all this :)|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if Canada can get it back|pg||

nt|bt: or even more juicy 3@S-4@H-D ...|pg||
nt|tez: 1@C or 1@d?|pg||
nt|bg: unless S rightfully gets carried away with an apparent undiscplined preempt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|reisig: Won't matter - however|pg||
nt|petepunt: upgraded is 14 to a 15-17 rebid here|pg||
nt|blum1956: Lev sitting with @h@s 55 and 14 HCP and listening for 1@h-1@s))|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 1d|pg||
nt|stc: you mean N ? you may also pass, wait and see....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: just kidding |pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: EW may cash the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: slim chance though|pg||
nt|mamos: wow that double is some call|pg||
nt|mamos: what is North supposed to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: N SRY|pg||
nt|ritong: waleed is wondering " are there so many hands with which we make 3NT and not 5 or more @cs"|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is the answer is "no"|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h an overbid as N has already denied 4 @hs|pg||
nt|bg: some pairs use 2 sia openings to show a really bad major and save the 2H/S openings for reasonable suits|pg||
nt|bg: Dia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no   4@h seems completely normal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, but I would prefer to look for a 4-4 spade fit first|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk5: Smolen auction perhaps|pg||
nt|reisig: BUT - if partner had KJx in @s -- we have slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you don't have a spade fit, you can get to hearts later|pg||
nt|tez: pass 1@c 1@d?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stc: and will get a second chance|pg||
nt|lml: they have 25 hcp so 2nt vul might not the favorite|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. many aggressive players would open 3@s with this hand, though I am not one of them|pg||
nt|bessi2: Cohler at this point delighted to be playing only 2@h|pg||
nt|bt: the flaw for a weak 2 is the void and playability in 3 suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but he goes for it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: will lead @S now|pg||
nt|bt: and the flaw of the multi w @S is they have a comfortable 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as they are not forcing declarer a lot in @Ds, he can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  read map has been given to opps|pg||
nt|andersk: Sadek will use the J to get the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone agree with N's 1NT bid?|pg||

nt|xenya: will have to take a @D hook it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: over 4S that is... |pg||
nt|lml: I think they should be quite happy with 1190 plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok we are all back now. |pg||
nt|xenya: the King is arked with E of course|pg||
nt|xenya: *marked|pg||
nt|andyv:  our 2nd push board|pg||
nt|bt: now south has an interesting hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: horrible result for n-s.. however I don't feel either player did anything awful in the bidding.. only the 2N bid is questionable but reasonable in my opinion|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i think we can congratulate Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: not entirely sure -- play waas very fast|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|reisig: maybe should change that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: alerted, but no explaination|pg||
nt|bt: 2n was aggressive but unlucky|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: fun fact from bd 25 (where EW were 4@H+2 both room here):|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike this 1@h bid though|pg||
nt|stc: and go to bed ! good night everybody, thanks all including specs and of course players !|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the boards have not been as spectacular by and large as yesterday 3NT looks ver straightforward here|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary plays Hampton|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary down 800 in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|bessi2: a clear 4@h bid imo, |pg||
nt|tez: 1nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: awkward for South|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting to see how NS will handle this|pg||
nt|bt: if it is permitted in their system its fine, other options are worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N open|pg||
nt|toral5: i doubt.i m sure he wd ve ruffed with 10.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 1nT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton down 1400 in 5@Dx...|pg||
nt|blum1956: the club slam is makeable here but neither easy to bid nor to play|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt or 5 clubs s/b no swings here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bt: i like 1@H in a perverted way|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 1N seems "normal|pg||
nt|mamos: oww|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S doesnt  seem ormal|pg||
nt|mamos: normal|pg||
nt|blum1956: the heart slam is clearly down|pg||
nt|stc: yes, you can't discard loosing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N is lebensohlish no doubt|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|bt: you dont want to open 2/3/4@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|reisig: Maybe ...they are getting warmed up|pg||
nt|mamos: practising 4-3 fits obviously|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to come up with something interesting:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: According to the NS CC, South could have doubled 2@c to show three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: 4441 likes balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: perhaps it isnt the boards its the players :)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  now, thts the action table|pg||
nt|bt: but u want to open|pg||
nt|toral5: defence can restrict 3nt to 9 tricks only|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: typical acol auction here,  11 tricks looks likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e asking question|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  fine contract and result in OR for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely tempting but Cohler cant do more than 4@s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South could have doubled to show 3@h, is his pass alertable? I don't know|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 25 - EW in the other room made 3NT , quite unclear how from the movie, it looked like a sure -1|pg||
nt|toral5: not a gud brd to watch from the kibitzing point of view|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bt: north should have a yarborough on the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bt: he is suprised|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we thank all the spectators for watching|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: tomorrow we have KO RD16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sementaç  "good clubs, bad spades"|pg||
nt|toral5: last board coming up after this.whn is the 3rd set?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|reisig: We all have different overcall styles|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: 6@c make in dd, but the percentage play is to take the @h hook and go down|pg||
nt|toral5: 1 imp at stake here:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: usually quite soon after|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks as well to WBF and BBO for these amazing oportunities to see the greatest players|pg||
nt|tez: congrats to zimmermann teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: please check the vugraph schedule for tomorrow broadcasts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking hard... he does not know it does not matter|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|bg: 5c-3d-1h=9 push next|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3rd set 55 min from now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 15:30 local time|pg||
nt|toral5: presumming they attack @S which is quiet obvious or dont duck @H|pg||
nt|bg: good play to continue now makes 4 maybe 5 if Greco does not cash spade Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: one hour|pg||
nt|toral5: thts y i said 1 imp at stake:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: I am told the 3NT score IS wrong so things are better than they look|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|bt: thoughtful lead by n, didnt matter here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i lost play sorry|pg||

nt|toral5: :(|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: Fredin in 4th with two strong US teams inbetween|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: either when you are weak|pg||

nt|mamos: last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, perhaps he was trying to disrupt NS's bidding -- but it seems he chose the wrong time |pg||

mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: "Service Unavailable" -  the web site must be getting a bit of a hammering|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|reisig: Yes|pg||

mb|5C|nt|reisig: "cold" game :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s on 26. 11 imps|pg||

nt|mamos: of this set -- two more stanzas today each of 14 boards   lots of excitement this week|pg||
nt|bessi2: VERY nice bid from Lev given that Cohler would never have defeated 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You just have the entry, @SK, to advance @HJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing a spade, a heart and a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: not surprising really|pg||
nt|lml: I am told that they did make 3NT but the operator input the play incorrectly|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: likely 9 now|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to vugraph op  and to USBF and WBF and BBO|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can get 2-2 red tricks, and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|mamos: was always struggling even with a favourabl lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bt: ns carding not efficient|pg||
nt|caitlin: suspect Cayne for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|toral5: he will play @D to the king and low @C incase greco has both kj|pg||
nt|caitlin: go to www.e-catsbridge.com   to Philly 2010.......and there is a click here for results|pg||
mc|11|nt|reisig: For me - @ds would be 4-1 and have to lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA onside (good chance), West with Kx in hearts and diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|xenya: operator showed the ideal defence  |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Operator, when you claim you have the option of claiming less tricks than the remaining. Please choose that option when declarer does not have the rest|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To the left in the window you can claim less tricks than the rest|pg||
