nt|fabsayc: the flaw with 2nt was the relative minor lengths, same perhaps for 4nt|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but what if 3@S or 4@s had come back from pd?|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@s is enough for slam with a minor fit |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Helgemo ruffed low -- then @DA @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Drijver has lead his 8 @D oward dummy and Zimmermann has played the 4 @D and Drijver is thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that works -- but on the auction is it best?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh    he didn't rely on 3rd seat opener having full values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT must be Drijver's concern too|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: in dummy now there is the KQ @C and AQJ1063 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Moulton sits with his cards together and I cannot view them for themost part|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: usually the dummy's cards are all I can see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we need to have all vugraph players take a turn at vugraph OPERATOR|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Drijver played the ace of @D and ruffed a diamond to his hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Bates was confused about brd 15 as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our excellent operator in Philadelphia , Traian; great job!to my talented fellow commentators Danny, Martin and Oosman for donating their time to guide us through ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: this match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: are we going up one board a segment|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty all for joining and for your helpful comments and messages.we hope you enjoyed the show. |pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|3for3: Those of you in shouting distance, not too late to come to Philly and play the Mixed teams.  Open World Event|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: BATES THINKING|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wold hand is totally useless to bates|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|3for3: its a cuebid fest|pg||
nt|3for3: all that to get to a game with little play|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over 1@H is penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: medecine vs psyches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double was hearts but bates was hoping for a little help somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: and it's not over yet..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wold is thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: lead your pd's suit?|pg||
nt|3for3: bates showed a strong hand, but could have bid 3@S instead of 4...so this should be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wold stil thinking......|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|hedyg: surely 4@s is not 5 lousy cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the off shape double strikes again|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow ...what a result in the closed|pg||
nt|3for3: wow, and 4@S made in CR, so this will be a big swing to Zimmerman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: lukcily no one can double|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wold said :you lost me partner|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: NS never entered the bidding there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wold: i did not understand the bidding|pg||
nt|3for3: it turns out NS don't need to double, but agains the more normal result of 4@S down 1, doubling could gain substantially|pg||
nt|3for3: I am told 4@S didnt really make|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think Bates happy that 4 does not make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently it does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no way to win|pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow south won @d ace when west played low?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we will be back in 30 mins|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh no he cashed @d ace when in with @h|pg||
nt|oosmanb: my mistake|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess 4@S might have made, defense cashed their A@H, and AK@D.  All that was left was the spade guess, |pg||
nt|hedyg: would Bates pass 1@H X with @hs? or would he bid 2@H knowing that Helness would run anyhow if he psyched|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely the 2@H bid is very confusing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i suspect started with 16  because that was 1st board in Women's KO  [15 board segments]|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Multon has lead a spade from the board and Brink has played the 4 @S and Multon is thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo opened 1@D in 3rd seat|pg||
