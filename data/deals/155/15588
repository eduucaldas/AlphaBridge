nt|rv: Hi Roland and all specs, welcome from a pleasant evening in Bangalore, Karnataka, India|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Alland and Geoff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, the venue of the test match|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes Roland, poised for an exciting finish tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: He was an excellent player years ago who decided to take some time off and go into business and now is back|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: he convinced Larry Cohen to end his 10 minute retirement and help form a new team|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: easy one to start off a semi-final match, 8 tricks should be straight-forward|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: How many times has Larry retired?|pg||

nt|algraves: so the @D 7 a big card|pg||
nt|rv: he may settle for 7 tricks though|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|h2|nt|algraves: he is worried that @S A is with Hamman|pg||
nt|rv: 3 of semi-finalists (Zimmerman-1, Nickell-2, Diamond) were in 1-16 bracket of seeds, Wolfson in 17-32 bracket|pg||

nt|lml: hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi linda|pg||
nt|bobh1: april|pg||
nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: and we are off|pg||
nt|tlc: Hi..welcome back everyone..|pg||
nt|daman: Rosenblum semi-final|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hi everyone|pg||
nt|daman: EW play a strong @C system with a zillion variations in their bidding system|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|henryb:  A Roland 20-20|pg||
nt|yuval10: Meckwell is having their rest at first session, as usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I'm not so sure I would have opened the North hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I cannot add: 21-19|pg||
nt|stc: What do we know about NS methoids ? Acol ? Weak NT ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a dull 3N to start with|pg||
nt|mgchat: drole d'association|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we have some cards - now all we need is to know who is really playing them|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1. segment of the quarter finals|pg||
mb|2D|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Marshall!!!  welcome|pg||
nt|mgchat: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: however    all roads lead to 3NT for EW|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: I think I would bid 2@H now with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: an exciting deal to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi April:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: NS-- strong NT, dia, hearts, and spades promise 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: club could be 1 if 4X1|pg||
nt|henryb:  East should be grateful that he was not left in 1@hXX|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: E/W play a baltic @C system, it's similar to a polish @C system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|mamos: all|pg||
nt|twcho: system on for overcalling 1NT I assume|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Tommy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Carl|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Trevor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: welcome to this round of 64 match|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Trevor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi April|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||
nt|lml: no but I think North should be|pg||
nt|lml: the points are very soft and he has shown about this much|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a lot of cards altho they may not be useful ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: quick note, I can only see one side of the table when screens are down so bids will be delayed until the board comes back.|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N will bid again because its imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hargreaves sementa|pg||
nt|milton_se: Eight tricks seem easy -- and there is the ninth|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby play a weak NT except 3rd seat VUL   but rarely open 1N with this shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: @H@H@H@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: First Board an interesting 3 NT, a major lead by north would make it difficult|pg||
nt|400 volt: but after @D A at least 9 tricks are there. I expect now 4@S, 2@H, 3@D, 1@C for +1|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is playing MUD lead it seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 15 boards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3NT played by east would be chanceless with a @C lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cards are favorable for declarer here|pg||
nt|daman: South will probably lead a @D after he stayman auction|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I dont have that yet. |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|twcho: i guess 56 as in the previous rounds|pg||
nt|daman: and extra entry now for the @C play|pg||
nt|daman: an*|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: as often happens in these cases when partner is broke, the 2 level is way too high|pg||
pc|c8|nt|twcho: anyone knows how many bds to be played each segment?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: a fairly quiet start while we all get settled down|pg||
nt|stc: now @c|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: this contract is very tight.  |pg||
nt|lml: it might make if east can be enplayed somehow|pg||
nt|lml: cash the @HQ and lead a spade?|pg||
nt|daman: East is probably playing N for both major suit aces|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|stc: ducking was better|pg||
nt|sharkey: I believe 14 boards|pg||
nt|daman: the @H spots are favorable for NS|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|oliverc: now ok|pg||
nt|400 volt: Alexander Smirnov is very young for his skill level. He is 28 years old as far as I know. So I expect you will often hear his name in the future, too. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
nt|daman: if N ducks this    E will p[lay the @S Q|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panosk: 9 cl droping makes the contract safe|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|400 volt: I was just told that the North player is even younger with 23 years and has won several national championships, too|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: seems to be a trick short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 15 boards|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, tks Trevor|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty Trevor - change from yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: after playing the @Cs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  now one trump and a @d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|stc: now @d and big trouble|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: yes I dont see a way to make|pg||
nt|sharkey: So 9 tricks I believe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oliverc: still a decent gain for Zaleski|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: There are 6 teams in the quarterfinal bearing US flag|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peg Kaplan|pg||

mb|1H|nt|rv: other 3 players are vastly experienced even at this level|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|rv: Wolfson doesn't know he lost 7 IMPs though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|algraves: so in the closed room a thin 3NT that is a signature of Meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I don't like Wolfson's X here|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|algraves: on the same lead, Meckstroth played two tricks better, first putting in 9 @D forced King then over to J to finesse club|pg||
nt|algraves: voila 9 tricks and of course they bid it|pg||
nt|rv: with 6-4, I will either bid 5@c/4n (2 places with longer @hs) or pass|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: at these colors, I will bid to the 5 level with 4n|pg||
nt|rv: I expect this contract to make and Meckwell to take save at 5 level|pg||
nt|algraves: this is going to make , and indeed even an initial trump lead would not have helped with east having to follow to 4 @D|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|algraves: this is part of the trouble with double being over used to avoid a decision|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion double by Wolfson should show semibal extras (with some @s length) with no great minor fit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|algraves: it is easy to say double dummy, but the vul opponents think they have a good spot in 4@S and you have an offensive hand|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|algraves: so if you want to bid, then bid but double should have much more defensive potential|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|sJ|nt|algraves: as partner with a balanced hand may feel they have no where to go|pg||
nt|algraves: it comes from over using the double to avoid making a committment|pg||
nt|rv: declarer has only 9 top tricks on @sA back and another @s when in @CK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rv: not sure if he can scramble a 10th trick|pg||
nt|algraves: I think in the coming year you will see double coming back a little to its more penalty oriented roots|pg||

nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: these guys are fast players.. <i will try to keep up|pg||
nt|yuval10: he prably cashed 8@s as well|pg||
nt|bobh1: an interesting 2@s opening on the 1st board|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the first board enables us to tell that the Dutch are North-South - no Frenchman would open 2@s with those North cards|pg||
nt|bobh1: got away with it despite QTxxx opposite a stiff|pg||
nt|bobh1: a violation of Burn's law|pg||
nt|dburn: but a Dutchman would, since it shows five spades and a 4+-car minor|pg||
nt|mgchat: puisque mes commentaires en francais interessent certains spectateurs, je me ferais une joie de commenter ce 3eme segment|pg||
nt|dburn: Brink now playing with his favourite partner|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: west in the oR responded 2@C and went onto 3@C which looks over optimistic|pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous board 3 NT also wud make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all|pg||
nt|pbundy: well done; not an easy hand with the entries and lack of spots|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC for EW from 2010 European Championship online at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
nt|lml: good morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: good morning|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N or 2N by East?|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - thanks Joe, and off we go|pg||
nt|bobh1: another unusual opening bid|pg||
nt|daman: wasn't bid in the OR   7 to Nickell|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@H a lousy raise?  or something artificial?|pg||
nt|daman: lousy|pg||
nt|pbundy: not easy to tell from rodwell's hand :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: how many spades will rosenberg bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: can't see explanation|pg||
nt|daman: this can get out of hand|pg||
nt|daman: Mech might get too frisky|pg||
nt|pbundy: he knows that partner has minus 1 hearts :)|pg||
nt|daman: Meck|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
nt|riccho: hi everybody|pg||
nt|mgchat: 2@s a la donne 1 pas facile a gagner, ils n'ont pas joué dans leur meilleur fit|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they would...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi April.  Good to work with you again|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karen Allison|pg||
nt|400 volt: the 1@C opening is either natural 12+, balanced 12-14 or an 18+ count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW have a @C sacrifice over 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi David|pg||
nt|tlc: hi martin, marko...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sry, was private :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry for late start|pg||
nt|daman: guess not|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive opening here from Martel|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what methods East-West use, but these are likely to get them to a hopeless game fairly quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can see   2@C neither promises a 4-card major  nor  points :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in days of yore when one picked up a hand like N has one could expect to open the bidding. nowadays one is lucky to be able to open if one holds it in second seat. 4th chair? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fuhgedaboutit|pg||
nt|mamos: ndo???|pg||
nt|mamos: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas ... Roland :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello Karen|pg||
nt|henryb:  I approve|pg||
nt|bobh1: justified by the playing strength|pg||
nt|twcho: should be a lively auction with both N and W hand with void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'll enter |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|tlc: may i join the fun?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jim -- you want to psyche or DBL???|pg||
nt|stc: conservative bid by katz, but well judged|pg||
nt|yuval10: no spots and very soft points, so E downgraded|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner could not open 1N, and will bid again with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: unfortunately for him it looks as if 3NT has a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sry, got distracted on last handò dec led a second heart, which Katz ducked....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
nt|twcho: can't predict what will be the final contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: the K @s is suspect but you never know|pg||
nt|riccho: I´m not able to imagine an american pair playing sth different from WK2 opening|pg||
nt|dburn: however, hopeless is as hopeless does - if declarer plays a secodn trump, South needs to cash out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Is this the real auction?|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction is out of sync but I think we can see what is happening  1@h from South f 1NT from North|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT I guess coming|pg||
nt|kareno: I get it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And it's an easy 3nt.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D NS is a nice contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'll enter Bd 1 as soon as pòssible|pg||
nt|daman: Michael Rosenberg is know as a "deliberate" player.  My guess is we will al;ways be behind the OR in terms of boards played|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: when I played 10-12 NT  i would try 2N as West -- but that was natural invite back then|pg||
nt|stc: now 3NT has a lot of play !|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: and not do anything heroic like underleading @hA|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3@S is a good contract. After the dbl of Alexander Smirnov south should be able to make|pg||
nt|twcho: can Rosenberg double 4@c to show @c fit|pg||
nt|pbundy: and not only does meckstroth take 2 more tricks than the other room - he and rodwell bid game to boot on  1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tlc: seems on this auction that stansby might try 3nt w/ many more HCP than he might have|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|riccho: but with the red aces this shouldnt be a big problem|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s tricks and 2 in each other|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: everyone is asking me about the running scores... go to www.bridgeblogging.com and click on the link|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think this will work out well for Auken though|pg||
nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: w s talking|pg||
nt|dburn: Brink intended that as choice of games|pg||
nt|mgchat: ca va pas gagner, lol|pg||
nt|dburn: but Drijver thought he was making a slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: not exactly a sporting double|pg||
nt|twcho: I think pass just give the opponents an easy ride|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is easy but not 5@s|pg||
nt|tlc: It looks like EW have taken a good save againt NS's 4@H contract..weinstein made a good dbl|pg||
nt|daman: habits of a lifetime|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps he shud bid 5@C - not much offence in his hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: If clubs can be only 3 long, that is a quirky bid.  I don't know their system, however.|pg||
nt|mamos: so for ayone confused by the auction we think South opened 1@H North responded 1NT and South bid 2@C  Im not sure why North thought 5@C was right|pg||
nt|mgchat: ca va pas etre mieux|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least no one has doubled it  yet|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mgchat: ils s'y sont mis tous les 2, car l'ouverture en Sud est le moins qu'on puisse dire : facultative )))|pg||
nt|mgchat: gratuit ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: they may have traded -500 for -200|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: W called the director|pg||
nt|mgchat: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|bobh1: on his partner?|pg||
nt|pbundy: rosenberg is blessed with fabulous red spots in his hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some specs are already asking for the link to the running standings.  please publish if you have it.  thanks!|pg||
nt|milton_se: the question is: does West have both H honours or just one?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe West only had one double card in his bidding box and wants the Director to bring him another one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|lml: 98 is a huge score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that....however, he might transfer and bid 3N, though action is doubtful, since that would at least give him two ways to win|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know. a spade back and a club|pg||
nt|lml: ruff ruff and a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Migry Zur Campanile|pg||
nt|pbundy: hello mig :)|pg||
nt|migry: Hi all from sunny Philadelphia:)|pg||
nt|pbundy: trying to see if king and a club gives declarer any challenges|pg||
nt|migry: in the first board Cohen made a normal pass of a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|migry: it's different after a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|pbundy: agree completely|pg||
nt|migry: when you know partner has a better hand and it's easier to play the hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: generally one needs less to make game when partner has overcalled vs opening|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Migry|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, in this case, at least cohen went plus|pg||
nt|migry: Hi:)|pg||

nt|yuval10: in the Apteker-Wolfson match, both tables landed in 3NT here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@c in OR looks like ab accident|pg||
nt|sharkey: giving up one @H shud be able to x ruff rest|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, so it seems|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tlc: agreed..aassuming they have that agreement on this auction(probably yes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stansby understandably went low because they probably intervene aggressively against these EW methods|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: too late|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|milton_se: now obvious|pg||
nt|pbundy: now declarer can give up a heart and a club - and claim|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: they both point to the same place|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Luckily for declarer, clubs and hearts are friendly and it will fetch.  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Wonder if eas |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|stc: we have the first medium swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: or a very weird decision by W to leave 2@c|pg||
nt|daman: and they will pick up IMPs since they are +790 in the OR|pg||
nt|migry: I'm sure North won't claim yet as he may get an overtrick if east doesn't cash the club|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|algraves: well he takes 4@D and 6 trumps for 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: east has to follow to all 4 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes, he needs to find that play|pg||
mb|1N|nt|algraves: I mean west had to follow|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 1n by Wolfson shows 18-19 in bal seat w/o any action by partner, if he has less with @h length he will pass since partner has not acted with supposedly @h shortage|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: this time the 7 wont help|pg||

nt|mamos: it seemed that North had little idea what South's shape was so East was a little unlikely to know either|pg||
nt|dburn: duly accomplished in jig time - having spent this afternoon watching Weichsel, Feldman, Sadek and El-Almahdy, I must say that it is refershing to see bridge being played at normal ...|pg||
nt|dburn: tempo|pg||
nt|riccho: rofl|pg||
nt|stc: to beat 3NT S must lead a @cH and switch to a @h when ducked, not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c seem like a good sacrifice for NS, but other room didn't find it, though they bided and supported the suit|pg||
nt|ady: how many clubs?|pg||
nt|twcho: at least 5. :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: depends what agreement they have 1. seat I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: the only advantage is than, that you get the results from the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one way or another board 2 will be a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S, usually not 10 HCP & 5332|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, strong no trump, nothing much else special for North-South|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: the first board gave 7 IMPs to JOSEF and CARDS|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table ended in 1 NT|pg||
nt|400 volt: making one trick less|pg||
nt|sharkey: he heard you Tommy:)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s make 5@C  without spade lead|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stc: very good sac in 5@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's some X by North with very minimal values|pg||
nt|stc: 9 or even 10 tricks in @c contract|pg||
nt|400 volt: sry, 1NT+1, so 2 tricks less than this table :)|pg||
nt|migry: very tempting to "operate" with the north hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Nystrom-Bertheau  almost all hands with 16+ HCP start with 1@C [some 16 have options]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned double from N...some would bid 2H as that is the most likely place for game. but here Martel is not willing to bid 2H then back in with douyble, so he preferes to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: show the polyvalent nature of the hand immediately|pg||
nt|pbundy: must be that ten and the 9's that upgraded rosenberg's hand :)|pg||
nt|migry: when you are favorable and "know" the opponents have a game |pg||
nt|daman: or his 3   4's|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder if rodwell can XX for biz|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if any other vugraph session has seen/heard the use of 'polyvalent'|pg||
nt|400 volt: Sabine Auken lead a much more successfull spade|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to raise what might be a three-card diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: again 3@S by N/S is the best contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes with @H lead...|pg||
nt|ady: or diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: sounds very chemical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vocabulary quiz at end of set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S torn between H and NT, H will win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Martel's action was a Forcing Pass situation -- where 2@H weaker than PASS then bid|pg||
nt|kareno: That double announces a penalty pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if S bids he is more likely to bid 5@h, which will be very costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think|pg||
nt|stc: why not 4NT and 5@h on 5@d ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: I expect them to end there|pg||
nt|ady: found it|pg||
nt|twcho: he found it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
nt|pbundy: this will suffice :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
nt|mamos: that 1@S overcall was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|kareno: No but if you don't get your suits into the auction, you can be run over on the partscore hands.|pg||
nt|mamos: the danger on this hand seems to be of settling in 3NT|pg||
nt|milton_se: needing Hs 3-3 or the Q with East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1NT by north?!|pg||
nt|tlc: seems right..i might have bid 1NT last time around|pg||
nt|daman: not looking good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|riccho: X|pg||
nt|stc: and very happy on 5@c !|pg||
nt|bobh1: N restrains himself|pg||
nt|bobh1: even 3 is in doubt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to guess since 1N was artificial|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because I think 4N and then 5@h should be a slam try|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll be ok with careful play, i believe|pg||
nt|stc: when a vul op bids 4@s ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, even then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: screen down; Robson asking questions|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, torn between raising hearts and trying for NT via 2S|pg||
nt|tlc: this time the conservative view will not pay off..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and who can blame him?|pg||
nt|400 volt: you may ruff a @H in dummy|pg||
nt|400 volt: so even with @H 4-2 and the queen with west would make 3@S laydown|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all. Sorry, computer problem. Had to restart|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, missed the 4th trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n looking at conv card|pg||
nt|400 volt: 8 IMPs for the VITO team: Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim ended in 4@S last board, down 2|pg||
nt|migry: he can't really make it|pg||
nt|daman: favorable @H spots for NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|riccho: I have to admit I would have doubled this|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps 5@c was the solution, N looks to have no points, good hope for a 3 suiter|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he doesn't have that much - but in the modern style a raise to 2@h would be conistent with a minimum or near-minimum double|pg||
nt|twcho: anyway 5@c is a good sacrifice. 4@h should be cold|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And you've exactly identified what was about to happen.  @h Q to beat it.|pg||
nt|400 volt: E/W leading 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|400 volt: (6th)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: It's right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 8 tricks provided he guesses the @Ds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has a reasonable X, for sure|pg||
nt|daman: or plays for -1 and plays @Cs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|stc: In OR NS knew about the @c fit but decided not to preempt, strange ?!|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the OR North knew his partner had at least three clubs. He did not know about five|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has every reason to think that the black suit strengths of the defense are massed behind those of the offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin opened Stansby's hand so they had relatively free run to 4@H  again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and it is a NV game|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rosenberg probably has longer clubs than hearts yet did not lead them, so maybe heart return better|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pbundy: should have stuck with 1NT x, so it seems|pg||
nt|daman: or 1NT xx|pg||
nt|pbundy: that was systemically not an option, i would guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: here I think the 2@D call is too much from W|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|mamos: The Cayne team have started strongly |pg||
nt|migry: North would not have passed that|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  And S did not know his partner was that short in @s|pg||
nt|stc: If Zia x 3@c N will know better about the fit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|kareno: South needs Kx of diamonds in the pocket and it isn't happening.  He may play diamond to the ace (expecting spade ace in west) just in case of singleton in east.|pg||
nt|stc: oops|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an important guess. He might well go down four now|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@h now|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy though|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: appearently it is for W|pg||
nt|stc: W knows that S has only 4@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like he will be three down|pg||
nt|stc: and 3IMP|pg||
nt|stc: 3 rounds of @d probably better|pg||
nt|yuval10: Cayne already down 15:0 against the Danish team, but of course there's a lot of boards to go|pg||
nt|yuval10: Roland must be happy though|pg||
nt|henryb:  they can play diamonds after ruffing a club|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: this wont take long|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh i am sure - but - do they really have a good spot in which to land? |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: the 1 @H response is usually less than  8 hcp|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|kareno: Whichever, he is going down for the count.|pg||
nt|xenya: the 1@D opening (instead of 1N) has worked out quite well here -- also note 2@S by S|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cT|nt|yuval10: now small @d for -4|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 3 rounds of @d will force declarer|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jkotor: especially when S has A@s...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|migry: not really - but 2C wd have been my choice and take it from there|pg||
nt|pbundy: patterning out, mig :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kareno: Nice pickup for the Cayne team for being in the best contract.  Belgium hovering on the brink with the last hand and now this one.|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice def|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Marshall, gm|pg||
nt|algraves: yes, Hamman is such a great card player that he sees no need to mess with 50 plus years of defensive circuitry|pg||
nt|algraves: it take a bit of a learning curve to change anything|pg||
nt|algraves: and since he defends as well as anyone, well why fix it if it aint broken|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|algraves: and Zia comes for old rubber bridge roots|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand is not trivial to play|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is playin to ruff out both hearts using diamond King as re -entry but now stops to consider|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rv: what is best line on this, I did consider taking @c finesse at trick 2 and keeping other options incl @s finesse for later|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: two rounds of spades to see what happens has a slight attraction but odds are against that working best and meanwhile it could make the trump situation more tenuous|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: looks like LC has hit upon easy winning line|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: i do nt know about trump finesse....two rounds would likely hurt you|pg||

nt|lml: yes something lingering with oil is the usual punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where our NS in partscore and other table game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he thinks it will be an 8 card fit. having said all that, LKosing Trick Count still says "stop thinking and bid a game already"|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a good score for Cayne in the OR  - not so easy to avoid this outcome I think|pg||
nt|dburn: not that Janet de Botton was expecting to be in game - she was catering for a better part score if partner happened to have three spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|stc: K@s was not good :(|pg||
nt|dburn: you might, but Drijver no doubt intended to treat it as 18 balanced or so if partner bid 1@s|pg||

nt|lml: guys just sit back and bid your cards... you are good enough|pg||
nt|riccho: yes careful bidding but partner ....|pg||
nt|yuval10: had E just discard a @s over the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 14|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: well it turns out that the first two recorded scores are played in 6|pg||
nt|mamos: Polish Club|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with 3 prime cards, north's optimism had a solid basis|pg||
nt|dburn: 14 IMPs did come to Zimmermann for the North-South tragedy on board 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: This match is between the leaders of this group.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd time in a row  their NS went down|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @d ruff and 2 last tricks is for E with his trumps|pg||
nt|migry: 1@s  positive natural|pg||

nt|mgchat: l'ecart se creuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: another potential gain for Zaleski here|pg||

nt|bobh1: the @c A is well-placed for NS|pg||

nt|ady: thx Tommy|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: even beter|pg||
nt|migry: the 3@d bid stopped EW from finding the @c fit|pg||
nt|daman: Board 3 was a push    which is par really|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, and it would seem that one can make 6 - but - not at all sure how you ever reach it|pg||
nt|migry: and the club slam|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzsv: Just FYI < I can only see one side of the screen.  So bids by N & E are delayed until the board comes back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect we'll finally see same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, alerts are only from the W S discussions|pg||

nt|panosk: they ll stop at 6 i think lets see if he makes 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got too much to never do anything|pg||
nt|lml: After making a grand he was just worn out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass the lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is in effect what willenken did with trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he will need to unblock spade queen also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we're still here|pg||
nt|tlc: not unblocking the Q@S will cost 2 tricks..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only one perhaps, and weinstein can prevent the unblock|pg||
nt|tlc: declarer will have set up a pitch in dummy, as well as endplayed him|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: maybe coffee or drink of choice time|pg||
nt|kareno: NP Jan :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; then we can see how the wolfson team did it!|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably heard what you said about two pairs out of two missing it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the knockout phase (starting tomorrow), the brackets will be formed taking into account both the WBF master points and the ranking in the round robin|pg||
nt|xenya: we can all see that a club lead beats it -- but...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oliverc: much better|pg||
nt|panosk: he cant make 7 here though|pg||
nt|lml: Suit showed five spades and four hearts nicely|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz took a minute to play Dace, now says I had not problem on the first trick|pg||
nt|mgchat: un record, regardez tous on a passé le cap des 20000 joueurs sur BBO|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 2@c by west?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: I think this will work out okay though.  north south dont have all that much|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intersting April -- normally operator can see all  [know all, etc]|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: North should make this.  He is going to guess spades on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: and East has no entries|pg||
nt|lml: he really can't make it without spades, he may as well go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after heart ace (if W wins it, he should lead back D 5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: well now we have only 1 other pair bidding the grand and four missing it|pg||
nt|lml: maybe an endplay though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: with bidding i lead c|pg||
nt|twcho: seems not Gazilli as the strength requirement is not met, only 15|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes sometimes passing all the time works well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: despite East's double, @SQ looks a moderately attractive lead  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: here it works ok|pg||
nt|daman: getting to 6 is not chopped liver|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: so on this line lead @CQ likely ducked,  Heart to hand club|pg||
nt|lml: but it seems a bit messy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: this will be over fast|pg||
nt|bobh1: its just not as much fun|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: NS upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lml: well the OR missed the grand|pg||
nt|lml: he cant really travel back and forth|pg||
nt|lml: well lets see if it works|pg||
nt|kareno: (_)?   Tea for me - I'm pouring - and cookies for all except Roland :)  OOOOO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: If anyone has any idea of how to get caps lock off on a tiny little laptop; let me know!|pg||
nt|kareno: Have you tried hitting the caps key again?  Shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Yes - doesnt work - I have to hold it down to talk. I"ll bring my own computer next segment - wasnt supposed to be here - B is still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is normal line though maybe unlikely to succeed given heart jack lead (not a common lead unless cards everywhere else)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pbundy: exactly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: I think he does have to play spades but maybe I am missing something|pg||
nt|migry: when you play a strong club system things are very easy if the opponents don't bid - when they interfere, especially at high levels, you have problems getting your suits in|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: gin|pg||
nt|oliverc: now|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens almost anything East tries is ok|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: South has the @H suit covered :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: he is missing something he can go down now|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump leads would have been more effective for the defense.|pg||
nt|400 volt: did he really play @H K?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|400 volt: obviously not|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table is in 3 NT this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they were claiming  at same time so no|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: he cant get back to dummy which is not a good thing|pg||
nt|pbundy: eventually, at any rate|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: Balicki, "Oh please don't throw me into the Rabbit Patch"|pg||
nt|stc: did he discard a DIAMOND from dummy ?|pg||
nt|stc: undo's needed :) Ithink|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no was a spade, sry.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now playing a spade from dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Wolfson hand 3   in OR  opening bid was 1@C   1@H response    2@C rebid  passed out   e/w  silent |pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: not any more|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: sometimes you just have to play to make the contract and GUESS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: willenken knows what to do, just double checking|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: it really wasnt much of a guess anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4 segments of 15 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|algraves: so cohen  of course gives it best line|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rv: we played 56 (14x4) till R16 and 60 (15x4) from QFs onwards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|algraves: Hamman has the minors so he bids them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16 x 4 in the final tomorrow|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rv: Zia's 2@s is ubiquitous 4th suit force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: he will now bid 3@c to show fit and GF|pg||
mb|3H|nt|algraves: Zia showing forcing Club raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: direct 3@c on 2@c would be only Invitational|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: Hamman showing heart help with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a nice hand for a suit contract, but the trumps are poor|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|algraves: well 6@C is a make, |pg||
nt|algraves: seems slightly below odds|pg||
nt|rv: yes 6@c is a make though not sure if it good combined N-S hands (single-dummy), double dummy it is an excellent contract since it makes:)|pg||
nt|algraves: so always the possibily of a swing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club king and club will appear soon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: safety play for 3 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Meckwell missed the club fit on 4, so 12 IMPs to Wolfson|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rosenberg-Willenken made it difficult for them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were in 3@D before Rod had shown a suit|pg||
nt|algraves: yes Rosenberg and Willeken did well to bounce to 3@D after strong club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves: and the clubs never were bid|pg||
nt|rv: yes Precision system issue if there are pre-empts on strong @c before suits can be got in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves: so Wolfson fighting back after " slow " sstart|pg||
mc|11|nt|rv: Precision strong @c is excellent for slam auctions if there is no Interference, that is why folks make it a point to disturb strong @c with crash/suction etc before opps can get ...|pg||

nt|lml: so passing throughout was worth 5 imp|pg||
nt|lml: North is really on a roll here|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think he will do that on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: so he was hoping to endplay Versace but he did not have the communictions to do it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I can see the hands on BBO, but the screens block my view of NN &E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 4 from each group advance to KO    our match is from Group F  where current standings   1) Fleisher 187  2) Italian Stallions 181  3) Fredin 152  4) Chile 150   5th is distant ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 137|pg||
nt|riccho: great play :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and four more when Fantoni adopted a different approach to Drijver on board three - he doubled 1@d, but then cuebid 2@d over the 1@h response and passed Nunes out in 2@h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: looks like Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: GER - TUR 2:0 :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: many W's would bid 2@s...i think 1@s is fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C not 100% game force|pg||
nt|dburn: how many victory points is that?|pg||
nt|lml: I love watching Martel and Stansby, one of my favorite pairs|pg||
nt|dburn: not a weak two at this vulnerability for North - or perhaps 2@d would have some other meaning|pg||
nt|pbundy: operator; are you certain 5 was claimed?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|riccho: I know that nobody is interested in that, but its an exciting game ... :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Anyone for X from East?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT is an interesting call, i thought we'll see the 1@c opening with 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h shows spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 1h is for 4 spade cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps the pitches were not reported accurately|pg||
nt|daman: une comedie des erreurs|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: might get too high?|pg||
nt|mcphee: an upgrade?|pg||
nt|tlc: now..do you bid 3nt or game in spades now?|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d Multi.  4@h pass or correct.|pg||
nt|mamos: South has a big hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: He has an easy lead...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT a puppet to 3@C?|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table guessed right in Board 4|pg||
nt|400 volt: so many imps for VITO|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H on for EW|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s shows a weak no trump with four-card spade support|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has more than that nominally|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some would bid 2@D inverted with south hand, the 4333 shape argues against that however|pg||
nt|pbundy: sometimes the players are very rapid and it is tough for the vugraph operator to see what is happening|pg||
nt|migry: 1NT = clubs if i'm not mistaken|pg||
nt|pbundy: tie game|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|400 volt: and after 3@H of josef piekarek i expect alexander smirnov to bid it|pg||
nt|mgchat: 3@c en Sud ?|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - an opening 1NT would be a mini, so this is a strong no trump|pg||
nt|daman: they reached 6@C in the OR   tie match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: made 6...sorry...I will correct it|pg||
nt|pbundy: thank you|pg||
nt|daman: and it was a nice auction as well|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, as some kibitzers have pointed out - the IMP score will remain the same|pg||
nt|daman: and Board-a-Match|pg||
nt|pbundy: even at BAM, george :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: slight 1 :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be costly if N searchs for the slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: cannot pass 1@d with a stiff so i also agree with 2@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@d|pg||
nt|lml: 3@d now you think?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N  but with little conviction|pg||
nt|tlc: me too|pg||
nt|bobh1: but a lot of questionable secondary honors|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 9 tricks in hearts   and 10 if peeking doubleton Q@S|pg||
nt|tlc: i also agree w/ the 1NT bid....i generally subtract a point any time im 4333|pg||
mb|3C|nt|riccho: me! maybe E X cards vanished? |pg||
nt|dburn: so he does, but why would anyone double?|pg||
nt|riccho: no no double here really :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Another cup of tea for this hand :)|pg||
nt|mamos: lol you drink faster than me  :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, my X says I have a good hand for my rprevious bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good non heart lead|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi peter :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - a little late :(|pg||
nt|daman: a detail|pg||
nt|migry: hi:) welcome|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: there are hands where everything is right for declarer    then there is this hand|pg||
nt|tlc: it has the added advntage that 4S is likely to fail..and apparently does|pg||
nt|400 volt: as mike expectet, 2NT forces a 3@C bid, either weak with @C or a strong hand with a Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: W might pass this|pg||
nt|bobh1: yeah that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sharkey: With @HKJ @SQ not an attarctive lead|pg||
nt|ady: might stigg out doubleton Q@S when south turns up with A@H|pg||
nt|ady: sniff|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Migry @H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mathat: 6 now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 12 on a @C lead, though|pg||
nt|mcphee: Naturally now he should have with this lead|pg||
nt|lml: you have all noticed that Lauria discarded in a way that Van Cleeff could have recovered by throwing him in|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 14-16 or so - 1NT would be about 10-12/13|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: why does it fail?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a make to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: your keyboard's like mine David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am with David .. pass and lead diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: director was here epressing concern about the slow play|pg||
nt|yuval10: considering the fact that other table already finished 8 boards, i guess he's right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a fairly common manoeuvre over a natural 2@C opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: remarkable restraint by Sementa but as a passed hand he refrained from hanging partner|pg||
nt|lml: it was the right lead to hold this hand tight I think|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 4    in the OR   Zia as South passed 1@S whereas Willenken jumped to 3@D after his partner overcalled       after that it was clear sailing to slam|pg||
nt|migry: how good/bad is 6@c?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am trying to weigh that|pg||
nt|pbundy: not wonderful, i would think - and - doesn't seem like quite enough wood to get there, either|pg||
nt|daman: not enough soldiers|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course on a good day, one could make 7 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that West didnt X 2@D - opening could be short|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: well|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell strikes back|pg||
nt|pbundy: no -- i don't think so|pg||
nt|daman: can't be right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|migry: not really|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: maybe not... he doesnt really need the ruff does he|pg||
nt|stc: and this with Robson as declarer :)|pg||
nt|ady: bad workman blames his tools|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose he could bid 2@d and claim 100 honours even if he didn't make it, but...|pg||
nt|riccho: very reasonable not to double here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have shifted to heart instead of third spade|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tlc: 3n yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|bobh1: he was probably hoping to set up a @h winner in pd's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   all wrong for 4@S so 3N better   i guess i forgot to type that part|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am talking about 4S, it looks like an easy make|pg||
nt|sharkey: Eliminate @C and endplay N?|pg||
nt|sharkey: in @D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: must be an operator problem|pg||
nt|migry: just some mistake in the scoring|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tlc: u are right..heart pitch on club..my bad|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  i missed that too|pg||
nt|stc: Cayne now in front but Lavazza 0-13...but the way is long |pg||
nt|henryb:  They have about 1 hour to play the rest of the set|pg||
nt|stc: 14 in a set ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|stc: Robson worried about @d 4-1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: the @D8 was a strong signal for the ruff though|pg||
nt|ady: also  possibly north can be endplayed|pg||
nt|sharkey: no entries though|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: Cayne did make it... |pg||
nt|lml: Balicki played it as I would have|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: no more, should accelerate now|pg||
nt|stc: now worried about @s 4-1|pg||
nt|stc: For the declarer the play is not so obvious|pg||
nt|yuval10: he has 10 tricks either way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Robson:  sorry|pg||
nt|daman: the thrill of it all|pg||
nt|migry: this board is scored wrong in this room|pg||

mb|2C|nt|algraves: not even the Hideaous Hog vs the rueful rabbit could do that|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: Zia decided to upgrade his hand and open 1n?|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@C clubs and higher|pg||
nt|algraves: Wolfson wondering how many diamonds is the right Risk / Reward action|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rv: fairly ordinary 14 hcp with Zia, I would have opened 1@c unless they play variable NT|pg||
nt|algraves: X was stayman to be sure|pg||
nt|algraves: well that is why he is there and we are here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is guessing that Ds is not partner's second suit|pg||
nt|rv: yes on 2@c Inteference, most folks play system on including transfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rv: Wolfson would have XX for Cohen to bid his second suit, pass 2@c X with @c suit and bid his own suits otherwise|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|algraves: a misunderstanging here  I think|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Cohen was not on same wavelength and though Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 2@c is DONT showing @cs+another|pg||
nt|algraves: Cohen must  have thought 3@D to play 3 of second suit ie 4441 but ???|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the diamond bid by E was premature|pg||
nt|algraves: well they will get out for 500|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Cohen felt Wolfson's jump to 3@d has to with fit for his second suit since Wolfson is passed hand and can't have his own suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pick your moral to this story|pg||
nt|algraves: but it could have been a lot worse on other layouts to have that sort of mis understanding|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

nt|yuval10: things are getting more interesting here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not likely to be strong here, as North is a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: another possible swing in for croatia here.  4 spades looks biddable and like it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, next round 15:45|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and 3N bid quickly when Bathhurst opened Martel hand 1N|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@s WK2 anyone? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: no|pg||
nt|stc: A grand is always a good result, let's|pg||
nt|stc: EW may even win IMP in 7NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many times you'll have a hand like W's when your P opens strong 2@c ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 2@c opening here - EW play 2@C as 5-11, 5@h+5any|pg||
nt|sharkey: he knew N had @DK as S wudnt lead away from it - thus his line inferior to those mentioned|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: which board|pg||
nt|pbundy: the vulnerability keeps meck out|pg||
nt|migry: it's okay now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: played by North not best, but still shouldn't be any problem|pg||

nt|daman: yes   they changed it back|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west passed?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h This and Last board to the end of the Teams Event and All the Greek Islands Fantoni Festival@h@h We thank BBO and Roland especially for giving us the chance to ...|pg||
nt|tlc: with probable uptrick on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right again Jim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because West never got chance to bid|pg||
nt|tlc: actually on the right=meter that's only 1 of 2 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: some form of two suited opening|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d best contract for n/s but 3nt could beckon again.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: C writing explanation for B; D just said it quietly for Z|pg||
nt|lml: so many reasons for no|pg||
nt|stc: For the specs, 7NT makes on a sqz @S/@H on N, dd of course|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming he gets a club lead, he has a double squeeze|pg||
nt|yuval10: right|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it seem as if @h lead from S will defeat 7NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  and that is not double dummy|pg||
nt|stc: If E play, the @H lead beats|pg||
nt|henryb:  how on earth would East become the declarer?|pg||
nt|yuval10: many kibitzers argue that 1@s is better to open from E's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d sry|pg||
nt|stc: of course all this is hypothetical, they will play in @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if the "any" can be spades|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1NT 15-17, he obviously didn't like to treat his hand as a 1@C opening|pg||
mb|1H|nt|400 volt: 2@D showing a 6card major|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@S pass/correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has worked out which major South has....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e talking|pg||
nt|400 volt: I expect south to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and is prepared to go on in hearts if that is South's suit |pg||
nt|bobh1: so now we see what 2@d is|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's quite a lot more than a non-vulnerable Sjoert Brink might have|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
nt|dburn: would not mind it if playing a method where 2@d was a bad weak two, and 2@s constructive|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: LTC says N does not have a raise to the 3 level, but it is hard to resist with those trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will bid Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
nt|lml: excdept for the four card heart suit... it always burns me|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you play that way, you can often show 6-4 in the majors in response to an inquiry|pg||
nt|lml: headed for 3NT I suppose|pg||
nt|stc: OR opened 1@d which, on this hand at least, is much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very popular in Europe, this 2@D overcall |pg||
mb|2S|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
nt|bobh1: he lured them in|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's quite tough now for Nickell|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course he'll never pass, but it's not easy for them to understand they need to agree over @d|pg||
nt|400 volt: @S lead will make it difficult|pg||
nt|milton_se: trump lead probably sets it|pg||
nt|400 volt: but with the east hand I do not see a good option to @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can use it over other things as well - strong club, prepared club, loose diamond openings  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump seems a good lead here, as South is marked with excellent spades  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: s went to wash room w has both hands waitinhg for lead said he was changing cards|pg||
nt|dburn: so Drijver unwilling to compete to 3@d, in case his partner had rather less|pg||
nt|mgchat: entame aimable|pg||
nt|sharkey: Checkback 3@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
nt|400 volt: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously he doesn't like the ones he's got |pg||
nt|warrens:  the spade lead will be worth 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be interesting to find out if Martel was going to invite over 1@S-P|pg||
nt|mamos: ther eshould not be a danger of overbidding here with two Black Aces missing  but you never know ..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @d better|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@c is a very aggressive intervention. But as u c N advancing, he is expecting that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c might very well be interpret as agreeing @s, as many kibz suggested|pg||
nt|henryb:  Two suiters are often easier when you open one of the suits|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice values but horrible duplication|pg||
nt|pelu: and mirrow|pg||
nt|pbundy: not to mention unfavorable distribution too|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom and I would bid this hand the same way (so far)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
nt|dburn: but this lead is fourth best, in the sense that it is the fourth best suit for the defence to lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: not a good lead|pg||
nt|ady: red kings laybadly for possible slam in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is interesting, not sure what 2@C rebid showed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: everybody saying diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: nobody asked|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Ax is not such a great stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  I tink West will raise to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps 7NT |pg||
nt|fabsayc: normally this would be trump lead auction but levin holding wrong for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
nt|warrens:  they play 1nt rebid shows @C's and 2@C's shows @D's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what do they do with balanced hand in that case|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes it is|pg||
nt|xenya: @C lead would be best here, with the idea of tapping declarer -- now it looks like 4@S can be made |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: helpful lead as it happens|pg||
nt|panosk: it seems we have a clear winner here|pg||
nt|panosk: gd performance by |pg||
nt|marlowepi: al;most surely he would bid 2S over pass, especially NV|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..and i think almost everyone would bid 3S in the actual auction...too dangerous to withhold support and values|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very good, David|pg||
nt|migry: looks like the 5-0 split will be too much to handle|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H making (if u pick up @SQ) but 4@S? - endplay west to open @Cs?|pg||
nt|pelu: only DD|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|panosk: Zaleski team and congratulations|pg||
nt|yuval10: no, appearently he got it right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So a struggle here, but a quick play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz:  "thats all"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the diamond suit here is "frozen" - whoever plays a diamond first will have to give a trick away|pg||
nt|400 volt: I think double dummy you can now hold it to -1 as declarer|pg||
nt|400 volt: you have to exit with @C 10, east has to play a @H, you ruff and draw all @S|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done in both rooms!|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: W loved the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: count cards lead from 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally it would mean H king likely to be onside|pg||
nt|dburn: still, they can recover - North can draw dummy's trumps and the defenders can get three spades, three diamonds and that club|pg||
nt|sharkey: Nasty lead if in slam |pg||
pc|h8|nt|warrens:  good start for the defense, taping declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: ace and another would have worked better as it turns out|pg||
nt|400 volt: so east has to keep @C AQ and @D A10, then you can exit with a @C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: it will be good enough today|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: you can't avoid the @d finesse even in slam, can you?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am wondering if rosenberg can engineer some miraculous endplay against rodwell|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: 4@DX in the OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: South is a bit worried about the heart break|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but 3NT is not such a bad contract - still, I guess North was considering 3@d, and might have bid it|pg||
nt|warrens:  with 3 @s's they raise to 2@S and with exactly 2533 they have to punt, usually bid 1nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this is a variation on the cole idea?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, sorry, they bid 2@D to show 3-card @S support|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: 3Nt will make for the same reason 6@D makes|pg||
nt|milton_se: was enough to play C from dummy :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes that makes more sense|pg||
nt|pbundy: no matter what - an excellent nickell result in the open room|pg||
nt|migry: i've seen Michael make impossible contracts before|pg||
nt|pelu: duck and Endplay East on @Hq|pg||
nt|pbundy: i've seen him make contracts seeing only 2 hands that all vugraph people thought were impossible to make|pg||
nt|daman: he is a deadly double dummy player|pg||
nt|pbundy: with no defensive errors :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but WEst can ruff pd @H-trick and just wait for his @C-trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Re the slam on board 4, Greco-Hampson bid it, Helgemo-Helness did not, and Gu-Lu bid it, Pasman-Simons did not. So a 12 IMP swing in all 3 matches|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: he needs a club ruff but he also wants to cash the @SK|pg||
nt|lml: hard to handle all the entries|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @d situation will save him|pg||
nt|riccho: indeed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: making many|pg||

nt|400 volt: y :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: forgot he had an entry|pg||
nt|milton_se: C10 from hand still works|pg||
pc|s2|nt|itsgrim: rather one-sided sadly|pg||
nt|itsgrim: but well done to croatia|pg||
nt|itsgrim: and thanks to the operators|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: The results will be posted later  evening on website www.bridge-zveza.si Tomorrow session will start at 11 am|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: ty too ;)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: that's it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: yes but he doesnt know that yet|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: as will 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't East just win and play @CA and another?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprising Lew followed with heart 9 on second round|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: phew|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil in 5@D on essentially same auction [but 2@S Michaels]|pg||
pc|s7|nt|milton_se: talking about -1 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - dont think you can Tommy|pg||
nt|daman: can he get this righ once he won the @C Ace?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 5@D is a good contract|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|nt|riccho: the real drawback from aggressive bidding is that partner with heavy loaded hands isnt able to judge his hand well|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: not that i can see|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzsk: next round 16:30|pg||
nt|daman: a low @H from Hand?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  Weinstein has to give up a ruff and sluff, so -1|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pbundy: no - meckstroth could win and lead a club thru|pg||
nt|daman: Meck would have to rise with the Q lol|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SAKQT3H72DKQ4C975,SJH9864DJT982CKJ2,S9865HAKQDA753CT3,S742HJT53D6CAQ864|sv|b|nt|algraves: the sort of luck that is forgotten about as the match goes on|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: w said if it comes up again he will ply it e way|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: flat 4@s here? time for coffee/drink/rest-room break etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: this is there forcing raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd pass by E|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|algraves: wolfson might have doubled that|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@c is GF raise, East has a clear X, if it is Inv raise or Bergen, then some play X of 3@c as t/o of @s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|algraves: but he was probably thinkig about previous hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is not dangerous like doubling stayman, because here they are already in a GF|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Re the slam on board 4, Greco-Hampson bid it, Helgemo-Helness did not, and Gu-Lu bid it, Pasman-Simons did not. So a 12 IMP swing in all 3 matches|pg||
nt|algraves: so a routine 5@S|pg||
nt|rv: in this case since Hamman's 3@c is GF, East should have doubled|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|algraves: My mother would make this but would be disappointed there was no fineese to take|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a spade finesse would be imprudent|pg||
mc|11|nt|algraves: question from audience,  3NT would have been systemic showing something about hand , we dont know what|pg||
pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SAKQT3H72DKQ4C975,SJH9864DJT982CKJ2,S9865HAKQDA753CT3,S742HJT53D6CAQ864|sv|b|nt|oliverc: hello|pg||
nt|eleni: The 2 leading teams, with 1p difference:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last round today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, most europeans favor specific 2-suited overcalls as opposed to Michaels|pg||
nt|riccho: this hand is an example for that|pg||
nt|riccho: last hand... |pg||
nt|lml: they should get to slam on this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: director again warning about time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the first ltr of card is name of other team mates|pg||
nt|daman: psuedo crocdile|pg||
nt|daman: o*|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this week i've seen most variations of Ghestem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good minor shapes for D here but stiff heart is worrisome|pg||
nt|lml: anybody in this field who misses it will be embarrassed|pg||
nt|riccho: 6@s is a must for a serious partnership here, or?|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hands so far|pg||
nt|daman: in any event    a super result at both tables|pg||
nt|pbundy: a breather|pg||
nt|daman: pianola|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|migry: 2NT= game forcing spade raise|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: 2@h pass or correct as before.|pg||
nt|400 volt: Agressive bidding by Sabine Auken in Board 5 paid out well: instead of dbling 4@S they ended in 5@H, dbled down 1 for 11 IMPs for JOSEF and CARDS|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: what should West do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: w s passing notes|pg||
nt|bobh1: another bid swing as they didnt find their @s fit on 5|pg||
nt|mgchat: 3SA sont dans les cartes|pg||
nt|dburn: but another big swing went to Zimmermann when West raised a strong no trump to 3NT with his 4=3=3=3 11-point hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks pretty flat, either 4@H or 3N, both making|pg||
nt|pbundy: 4@C from rodwell?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: this is another hadn where all participants will get their money's worth in the auction...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those variations about the same....yyour Ghestem's as good as mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I do not promise I get all the spots right every hand, but he did not play KH|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 4@H on  6 was worth 11 imps - one down in 5@Hx at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: do not think love ones|pg||
nt|pbundy: i might double now with rosenberg's hand.  all points outside his suit|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - I am ask to go to opem:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he's gone for Pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass is expected by west.|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D is at least 2 cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry,  5|pg||
nt|bobh1: went 1N-3N, responder was 4-by-3|pg||
nt|dburn: and lost a heart and the whole diamond suit, for down two|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the "drury" is out|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good lead by Balicki.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: haven't noticed that bridge players "do" embarassment|pg||
nt|dburn: 7 IMPs to Fleischer came on board 5, where delcarer in this room took a seriously wrong (but entirely reasonable) view of the club suit in 1NT|pg||
nt|migry: that would be expensive|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
nt|400 volt: its funny, both partnerships at the table have a 10 card fit and didnt find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's done EW out of quite a nice diamond fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: seldom to play 1 NT when there are 2 huge fits|pg||
nt|twcho: 3rd seat 2@h can be very wide range imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: thx April...normally in that situation after a finesse one plays the card one is known to hold|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT strong spade raise, 3@h natural, 3@s waiting - no shortage - 4@d short diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: this one should be a quick one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now n e passing notes|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h was, of course, pre-emptive|pg||
nt|dburn: but Drijver was unwilling to be pre-empted|pg||
nt|dburn: and had beter know that the right play with this trump suit is ace and another, not two finesses|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
nt|mamos: Club position is crucial to the number of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a minimum -3 for 800.  Another good pickup for Cayne.|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he can conveniently take two finesses anyway, given the shortage of entries to the table|pg||
nt|bobh1: will also need to avoid 2 @s losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't worked as vugraph operator you should know that the ABSOLUTE toughest part of the job is play of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry me too|pg||
nt|panosk: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h improvisation - "last train" not actually part of the methods|pg||
nt|xenya: N may well envisafe slam possibilities here -- but even 5@S is too high on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: danger lurking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D full opener, not specific|pg||
nt|fabsayc: willenken 3@S i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they're exploring whether to play in nt or @H's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken squirming...seems in a quandary|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: however all is well|pg||
nt|twcho: so the 3@h bid by Rosenberg maybe a bit overbid|pg||
nt|sharkey: On Board 5 Wolfson picked up 11 IMPs - noted N didnt open the bidding so declarer had no indications how to play the hand|pg||
nt|ady: hand 5  11 imps for Wolfson   4@H -1 in OR    north did not open bidding  and led Q@C to 4@H    but later continued with a low club   declarer naturally played the top club from ...|pg||
nt|ady: dummy  so there was not end poaition  and declarer  took a normal spade finesse     unlucky|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, @s finesse will be normal then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken in deep thought|pg||
nt|pbundy: willenken may be envisioning short clubs in partner's hand - but obviously not now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club shift needed so club doesn't go away.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the lead has helped - he can build a second club trick now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
nt|dburn: Blackwood, one key card...|pg||
nt|riccho: looks like you know NS very well... :)|pg||
nt|lml: so far one pair has missed the slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ...stumbling towards Blackwood|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many players never let you see their cards, most just give you a glimpse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thanks Al! I agree.|pg||
nt|riccho: and their mothods|pg||
nt|bobh1: he might have tried 3N instead of 4@h atho i guess S would correct|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi David|pg||
nt|ady: this looks around down 2|pg||
nt|twcho: hi David|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken asking Weinstein questions|pg||

nt|lml: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|lml: this is actually a decent slam|pg||
nt|lml: all you need to do is bring home the hearts missing five to the jack|pg||
nt|dburn: he could anyway, with East onlly having three, but it has uncomplicated the play a little|pg||
nt|pbundy: a wise comment that you need to punish meckwell for these "outings"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: it is my dylexia|pg||
nt|bobh1: needed a @d lead here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East probably expecting 5/5 opposite - he's right if he does - just not the 5/5 he would expect |pg||
nt|tlc: 3NT is a better spot than 4H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: Lauria will try|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are not on the same page then. 6D was written|pg||
nt|dburn: I have played with them both once or twice|pg||
nt|lml: the team is Belgium Cooreman so we can all know which team needs to be embarrased|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: which was once too often for Malinowski - we missed a game, and he vowed never to play with me again|pg||
nt|400 volt: board 6 Daniela von Arnim is playing 4@S, but it's looking pretty well for her|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, difficult for both N and S to be certain how severe the punishment would be, with their known fit|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: yes defence is very strong  both E and W have very clear idea of what they are doing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e talking about n hand writing as being bad|pg||
mc|11|nt|400 volt: 9 tricks already there and the 10th is probably coming|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2N|nt|algraves: most play step resonses , show a non minimum balanced hand I bet|pg||
nt|rv: yes I presume it is non-serious 3n showing not too much extras|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Cohen thinking this deck has a lot of diamonds in it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves: cohen wants to suggest a save|pg||
nt|algraves: so he does|pg||
nt|algraves: s|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rv: other 3 level bids could be help suit slam try or stiff-showing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: Wolfson happy do defend of course|pg||

pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: sorry all but have to dash, my event is starting. enjoy!!!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|algraves: so on an auction like this Hamman has a lot of infomation|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves: the opps have only 17 HCP but bid over 2NT so he will suspect some shape|pg||

nt|pelu: hi all - late and waiting for coffe :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: easy now unless Hamman misguesses @c which is unlikely after stiff @s with LC|pg||
nt|algraves: this is best , hamman may duck this|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: n ask sing of e said standard|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: brd 6, Rosenberg went down in 4@s, 3n would have been a lot easier, still 12 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|rv: normally Nick Nickell plays first couple of sets and leaves the 4 pros to slog it out in last 2 sets right? |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|algraves: so he will get a complete count|pg||
pc|d7|nt|algraves: and go with the odds and play west for @C Q when he sees he started with 3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves: he will know for sure that west had 1@S, 5@H, 4@D and ergo 3@C|pg||
nt|algraves: and the odds are 3-2 it is the Q|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Nick Nickell keeps opps guessing, he might have wanted to field the 4 big-wigs when Wolfson plays more for psychological reasons|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: presence of Hamman or Meckwell in Wolfson's table might be more a few IMPs purely for psychological reasons|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: n hands folded across chest thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: East should play @C 9 if hamman cashes Ace|pg||
nt|algraves: so the bets are rolling in|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR N played @S to A and run @c10 in trick 3!|pg||
nt|algraves: he gets it right, he gets it wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Zia reading news paper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he cashes the ace he has decided to play for the queen with LC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it does not matter what a good player in the East seat does|pg||
nt|algraves: bridge is such a great game|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|rv: based on vacant spaces (more in West hand) for @CQ, he should get it right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last year in the USBF Women's Trials, some of the ladies from knocked out teams worked as operator and commented on how they'd never realized problems that players give operator -- ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that was great epiphany for most|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 16 board sessions|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lets do the time warp again|pg||
nt|tlc: using their time machine i'd guess to gho back?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe   maybe not 2001    more likely 2011   [fat finger syndrome?]|pg||
nt|sharkey: What wud you bid over 2@S Tommy?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he did - but North's stray queen might have been in diamonds, and trumps have broken 3-2 before now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: must have guessed spades|pg||
nt|pbundy: so; are you a 1@S or a 1@C opener with the north hand?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i myself subscribe to the 1@C school - but i think i am definitely in the minority|pg||
nt|migry: 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks... I was awaiting for a bit|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was -1|pg||
nt|lml: away|pg||
nt|mgchat: il reste un segment, mais ce match parait "plié"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oliverc: I suspect that'll be a poor result for NS, as there is no game on the other way|pg||
nt|400 volt: At least I expect N/S to find their huge fit now :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: and E/W, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: modern 1NT no rebid otherwise after 1@D and 1@s response|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: defense was good...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) (10)11-15(16) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  c) (10)11-15(16) any 4441    NEG DBL => 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h makes (better by north but the diamond is onside so it doesn't matter).|pg||
nt|dburn: hide your eyes, Roland|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is this the last pair using Flannery in the world?|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Flanery - limited opening bid, five hearts, four spades|pg||
nt|riccho: flannery??|pg||
nt|lml: no there are at least 3 others]|pg||
nt|riccho: stone age convention resurrected|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose it might just fit into your methods|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @c slam is not good, but certainly acceptable|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C showing both majors|pg||
nt|tlc: presumably transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C rubensohl showing diamonds|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for an explanation|pg||
nt|tlc: mind numbing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: less clear than MUD|pg||
nt|stc: you need to guess the @d position I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: named after Jeff Rubens who first published the idea|pg||
nt|tlc: unless normal lebensohl, in which 3 level suits are forcing, this can be made with any competitive hand or better|pg||
nt|tlc: the big advantage is shown on a hand like this...willenken immed knows partners suit and can compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 2@H is weak and 2NT is asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asking|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think you have a pointed suit squeeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C=both majors, at least 4/4 (!)|pg||
nt|400 volt: i'd bet ending the auction at least at the 5 level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and gets to declare as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think perhaps the biggest upside|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panosk: most probably |pg||
nt|xenya: @DK would beat 4@S here|pg||
nt|tlc: in std leben, west doesnt know his partners suit and the auction may have died in 3s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually had a bid to describe exactly 5@D & 4@C  but  those @C .... yuk|pg||
nt|kareno: Normal heart play works (for the drop).|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, a who's who of Flannery players is being delivered to me|pg||
nt|riccho: I´m told that hamman-zia and weinstein-levin still play flannery|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT or 3NT or pass|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing wrong with Flannery at all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sufficiently high level to constitute a STRONG recommendation|pg||
nt|lml: which one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I didn't think Roland allowed the F-word|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? Nickell passed?|pg||
nt|stc: how do you play on a @c lead ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he did|pg||
nt|stc: and @c again when you give the @s ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: south should bid 5@C now|pg||
nt|400 volt: and I expect west to go on|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 4x@D will set up a @s for defense|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume Rosenberg bid 2@H...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: ty April :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he doesnt have four clubs. he has 2 low doubletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that like  @SA  @HA  @DA  @CA  is just 2-pair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N jand not enhanced by S bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I saw that McAvoy underled the diamond honors and declarer went wrong.. well done|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z discussing something - I think that 2@c promised 4|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand for 2@C so is now probably worrying about going on|pg||
nt|riccho: the best with flannery is, that you cannot play another stupid 2level opening obstruction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether they have a clear agreement on 2NT here|pg||
nt|lml: well it probably made the north south auction tougher here|pg||
nt|400 volt: but I was wrong :)|pg||
nt|dburn: even that decent-looking plus 200 for 2@s down two was 6 more to Zimmermann when Fantoni and Nunes bid and made 3NT|pg||
nt|tlc: and as martin pointed out..it right sides the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: note Levin did not lead a spade|pg||
nt|pbundy: interesting choice of 2nd rebid with chris' hand|pg||
nt|migry: i guess he couldn't quite decide between 2 and 3 @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I think it was alerted, but it's not easy to tell some times|pg||
nt|pbundy: i sure like the south hand better after the club rebid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: 3@d showed 2 top hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe, but I get lots of weak hands and not many 5/4 openers|pg||
nt|twcho: partner has at most 8 bad pts and quite possibly 4 cards @s only. I am quite pessimistic about this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: txs Trevor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hope I am not too late|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi bob|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Bob, not at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: only K@H is off side, rest all good|pg||
nt|lml: but denied a maximum or 6-4|pg||
nt|riccho: X from N is what every intervention by NS is... |pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive|pg||
nt|henryb:  you lose a spade, win the club, cross ruff majors and cash the @cQ which squeezes West|pg||
nt|yuval10: only now Nickell "woke up" , a tad too late|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in theory, 3N is the best spot|pg||
nt|dburn: which was not a good contract, but they won't give the 430 back just because of that|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not the real auction|pg||
nt|twcho: that's why they are top players but not me|pg||
nt|migry: now 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: I don't like it either but it was effective here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|twcho: all the top players bid aggressively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no need to risk that|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West passed in first seat and East may be light in third - double is normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North has to X - as a passed hand it's not a big issue|pg||
nt|400 volt: now i expect north to bid 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S just too much with those red slowballs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4??   whoa baby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S at most. if S can make 4S facing this tripe he will bid it over 3S 97% of the time|pg||
nt|tlc: hope springs eternal|pg||
nt|400 volt: with no @C trick coming, and the @S Qxx onside|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable to stay in part score     |pg||
nt|sharkey: Whenever I lead from trump !Qxx pd has xx...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: possible swing in the last board, thats all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been reminded Martel-Stansby actually were on Rose Meltzer's winning team of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: this is the Worlds and IMPs!!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it seem as if NS can always find their @c fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: but the right decision here, 5@H one down after @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @HQxx|pg||
nt|migry: and Michael will have to cope with another bad @s split|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: and an immediate tap|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|lml: cute lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: most of the field is in 3NT which will do well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|riccho: long time studies with 2l-openings showed, that WK2 openings have a minus expected value|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: now that is a problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: Shenkin wide awake ruffing high|pg||
nt|lml: well done VanCLeeff|pg||
nt|lml: the opening lead set declarer up and now the trump promotion takes him down|pg||
nt|lml: that should cheer up north-south|pg||
nt|lml: staring at it will not help Versace|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Versace is thinking hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact S might bid 4S over 3S with his actual hand, so even 3S seems ambitious, especially NV. curious that N would be so ambitious here in a set where NS have heretofore shown ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consistent prudence in regard to NV games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room where Zagorin overcalled 1@S and Bathurst bid 2@S in comp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it certainly is!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question from spec:  was @D8 signal for @H?         very possible - or reverse count with 5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: he has too many trump to endplay north|pg||
nt|stc: I was expecting the set to finish at about this time, have to go, by all, c u later |pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: lost the play...not showing cards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: will make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: "how could he underlead the ace????"|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since South could be pretty strong - that's the thing about Flannery: a hand that would bid 1NT over 1@h cannot so easily bid 2NT over 2@d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: 3NT need one of the black suits 3-2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: of this score were to hold up at the end of the set Rayner would overtake Lavazza who would drop to third place|pg||
nt|pbundy: crossed that hurdle|pg||
nt|daman: chinese finesse|pg||
nt|pbundy: some suggestions that rosenberg might have tossed a heart at trick 1.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobh1: the Canadians will pick up an imp on this board due to a better lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|milton_se: best possible result for NS|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: in this case -- both answers work|pg||
nt|tlc: nice play..promoting the 9S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: chip is reading the paper... the J9 are still on the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Meck in deep thought|pg||
nt|pbundy: if meck ruffs this, he seems endplayed into doing something favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: fingering 9 of H|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: it is fun to watch your friends play so well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|400 volt: b6 no swing, daniela von arnim guessed the situation wrong at the end and played @D to the king|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so often on these boards the "right" action is indeterminate - in such cases, if you have an enormous fit, it's right to declare |pg||
pc|d7|nt|migry: very well played by Michael|pg||
nt|daman: this session is 15 boards|pg||
nt|pbundy: sadly for his opps, that is michael's standard operating procedure :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rv: not my choice of opening with East hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|algraves: so 4@S went down two on the Cohen wolfsson 4@D adventure for 12 to Nickell but I bet dollars to donuts that the other room will make 4@S|pg||
nt|algraves: on this last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: not good|pg||
nt|rv: Cohen's 2@c is checkback asking for 3 card @s with Wolfson and is atleast Inv+ (possibly GF)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|rv: not sure if they play 1 way (2@C-->Inv+) or 2 way (2@c-->Inv, 2@d-->GF) checkback here|pg||
nt|algraves: you know it is better on these checback auctions to play steps showing min, or max with or without 3 card support and leave the other major for later|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: If Wolfson had passed in first seat, they might have played this deal in a much easier 1n (LC would have passed 1@s-1n)|pg||

nt|lml: VanCleef took advantage of the auction.  West showed good hearts but not a MAX|pg||
nt|lml: so East (or South) is quite likely to hold the @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff You make me 10 years older that you didnt play the 9 first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Nystrom-Bertheau have been on a World Champ team -- but they've certainly represented their country a number of times in international competition|pg||
nt|tejjyid: as they did|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: np|pg||
nt|pbundy: vwd by rosenberg|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|lml: do you like being in a slam missing QXXX off an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: a slam is available on this one|pg||
nt|lml: Qxxx of trump|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H looks automatic|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S - 2 on hand 7 was push|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: keycard tells you that the trump queen is not there |pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it's about 54%...plus whatever edge declarer can find by card-reading|pg||
nt|lml: apparently it was alerted as a MAX.  I am just reading the card|pg||
nt|lml: which is in teeny print even at 125%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in 3rd seat -- Martel-Stansby don't cheat on the Weak NT openers|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose chip will venture a light passed hand t/o X?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprised Lew did not open in 3rd seat at these colours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his only choice was 1N --- or 1@D then pass all responses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the latter is what i had in mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly Marshall -- i didn't think about 1@D until i started typing :)|pg||
nt|riccho: david 1NT = 12-14?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: It looks over 50% to me played by north.  Shrug.|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 1NT is strong|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: shows hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes   I gathered  also 13 cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: anyway a great lead|pg||
nt|kareno: That redouble could show the high honor in hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer to use it with ace or king only however.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D asks about RDBL - Z says 9-10-11 then says something about 3 @hs, but I donàt know if it was shows or denies|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@C this time the weak balanced|pg||
nt|milton_se: pretty aggressive young man ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: X showing 3card @H|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c natural or balanced game force, I guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: lead directing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: wonder if meckwell can stay out of game|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: I am told by the guru in the next room that it is 52.5%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double?|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes, very aggressive 1@S bid|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@H showing a good raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: and srtificiality may follow|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: second best from weak suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light for Italians|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now heàs said some more about how many @hs he expects, but I still canàt tell whether less than 3 or 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: D asks about ten - interior sequence or shortness|pg||
mb|2N|nt|400 volt: so north can show he really doesn't have anything|pg||
nt|pelu: cayne could not be sure on 5 card @s - but even on 4-3 4@S looks better from his side that 3NT|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N a better spot than 4@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: especially on this layout|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 2d denies 4 cards in the S|pg||
nt|dburn: very much so, although 4@h will probably make in practice - East won't lead a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 2S shows 3 cards in H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@d was probably a relay|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps it shows a preference for defending at the three level rather than the two level, which is where he would be defending had he committed a series of geriatric passes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rosenberg motionless, staring at his hand|pg||
nt|ady: should west play 3NT  a heart lead about the only lead to let it through    but maybe north  is used to his partners overcalls|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @H lead only 8 tricks and looking at dummy not difficult to defend|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still motionless|pg||
nt|sharkey: If played by W|pg||
nt|twcho: but @s is blocked|pg||
nt|pbundy: IF 2nt is invitational, then i'm not sure what meckstroth is considering|pg||
nt|migry: i guess that they tend to invite with very "heavy" hands otherwise no reason to think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: lots of explanations of the alerts taking place|pg||
nt|migry: even if really heavy, i don't think there is much to think about|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: 2@d just denied spades, I think|pg||
nt|dburn: but Drijver has judged the matter well - may be unlucky not to be rewarded|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if they knew the score they would want to have bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slightly surprising E sold to 2S|pg||
nt|bobh1: I dont think a @d lead is impossible v 4@h|pg||
nt|twcho: so once @h lead when west declarer, 3NT will make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: useful here as levin will surely switch to hearts if given a chance|pg||
nt|tlc: trying to sneak his 9th trick early|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kamil opened 4th seat 1@C and is declaring 3@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed |pg||
nt|ady: might not be able to cash 2nd heart in 3NT   and cant get back to do so     so may still go down   but no thx to the overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well this is the Goldilocks level|pg||
nt|pbundy: must be the 10 of diamonds :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: just right|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: same lead in the OR|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: with @D 2-2 think he can|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: and probably same result|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: the defence has a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|pbundy: meck probably just couldn't stand the thought that rodwell might have enough WITH a favorable layout for a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think rosenberg actually misplayed hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no reason really not to run diamonds first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rosenberg complimented NS on their defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if south had club ace there is no danger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they are discussing whether N should have led J or small in hearts|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: they probably are not aware of how far behind they are|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't think 3nt makes if S ducks the first club.  then the defense always has 5 tricks and delcarer doesn't have communication|pg||
nt|ady: yes    thx John   still cant make    but I tht would make a point of my thts on such an overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Weinstein asks about bidding; now thinking hard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: after the 2H cue by S, the chance of driving NS a level higher are not bad, despite them being 2 passed hands|pg||
nt|chessmaste: For any spectators still awake at this table this has no chance|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tlc: this hand illustrates the down side to a nebulous 1D...it's hard for partner to compete when he would otherwise|pg||
nt|xenya: it has been pointed out to me that 2@H by S might be a better choice -- i tend to agree|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: we should see some imps coming in for Auken soon|pg||
nt|hedyg: got 1!!!|pg||
nt|lml: a club now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or it's too late|pg||
nt|dburn: well, nothing is impossible, but anyone who found one from @dAJx would need some pretty solid evidence from the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: Jon made an overtrick in 6@H|pg||
nt|lml: the did get out of the schneider|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzsk: rewoke|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it would be altogether ridiculous to open the South hand a strong no trump, but South is not the sort of player who goes in for that sort of thing|pg||
nt|lml: needed the club through|pg||
nt|lml: she can now either play a spade or play the top diamond and then a spade|pg||
nt|lml: int the latter case Marteil will be endplayed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile both minors may be viable at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like if the redouble does show a high honor, then heart lead would be good with that west hand - you give up a trick but get four quickly after that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z smiling, joking with D - guess he liked the result of his club switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I donàt think the RDBL showed a heart honor, just values|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: i can understand them putting much thinking in the boards, it's a world championship after all, but that's really way too much|pg||
nt|yuval10: OR has finished merely 6 boards before here|pg||
nt|dburn: they had easier hands in that room|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: well done|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
nt|pelu: ??|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: oh he took @cA|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: true, but there is almost surely a three level fit|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think all of the hand types for 4th seat 1@D mean there is either a minor fit OR partner has BAL 15-16|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe a double fit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|milton_se: couldn't afford that 9D :)|pg||

nt|rv: I expect Meckwell to stay out of last game, let us see:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I expect Hamman-Zia to bid 5@D here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|algraves: NS 5@D or 3NT North|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|rv: Hamman will bid 2@d on which Zia might bid 3@h as splinter|pg||
nt|algraves: I am being bombarded from desks all over the country|pg||
nt|algraves: sorry  I should have said on the street who made up theories to beat meckwell|pg||
nt|rv: Zia is considering 3@d or 3@h|pg||
nt|algraves: you have to play your best bridge and let the chips fall where they may|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he will bid only 3@d since he had poor vul O/C in first place|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves: support with support|pg||
mb|4H|nt|algraves: Q bid later|pg||
nt|pelu: Meck in 2½NT - Rodwell invit with 2NT , and.............................|pg||
nt|rv: Hamman's 2@d is not game force and could be Inv, hence Zia's 3@d is well judged |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: pass:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did I win?|pg||
nt|algraves: wrong again|pg||
nt|algraves: well they are getting old|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: well judged all around here|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 5@HX = 500|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: Meck also in the very bad 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, you have a late entry for the heart finesse but it is scary|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rv: Wolfson played the man and not his cards on that 3N 1 down deal, if he had bid for his cards, he would have scored 5 IMPs for his side|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
mc|11|nt|algraves: so 5 one way or another|pg||

nt|kareno: So far Cayne pitching a shutout.|pg||
nt|bobh1: doubleton is unattractive with 4 trumps and leading from xxxx is not a growth industry|pg||
nt|dburn: now, does Zimmermann play Zia-style weak two bids?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: okay off the schneider... thanks guys|pg||
nt|pbundy: looks like a good 5@H save - unless i am missing something|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: today's matches are 56 boards in four stanzas|pg||
nt|dburn: weak 2@d available if South elects to use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: strong club with symmetric relay system here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS but i doubt anybody can get there...|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs looks a likely partscore for n/s.  |pg||
nt|mamos: for me 2@C would be Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, only 56.  In our US events we start (and end) with 64 board matches.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would be bidding 3@c to play.  2@c would be stayman for me too.|pg||
nt|mamos: roland told me 56  so ...... I believe him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: really do not like that call|pg||
nt|dburn: but now it gets a bit ugly, because North's 2@h is (as I recall) not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: It doesnt help Martel to split on the previous round.  South wins and playes a spade and Martel is endplayed in the blacks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: plyed fast missed clicked sorry|pg||
nt|pelu: very passiv to sell out to 3@C with 9-10 tricks for EW in @s|pg||
nt|dburn: it would seem so|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont they play 2-suiters?|pg||
nt|dburn: however, unless he has already shown a two-suiter he may be tempted to bid again in a position where he is "not allowed to"|pg||
nt|ady: e/w destined for 4@H  which should be down 1  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzsv: 2D does not promise diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: W gambles that E has a few|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for him|pg||
nt|bobh1: N is wondering why he has such a good han|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|dburn: but this gives him a chance to get his second suit in at a convenient level|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 2NT?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: tesla has interesting hand pattern so i believe he'll ask several relays and settle in game when he finds out nothing awesome at west's hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am told it is 18-19 BAL with no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx you all know more than I do :)  not a lot of talking going on here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H now by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: We must believe Roland (or die) :)|pg||
nt|riccho: Here u can see the advantage of a flannery opening... :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  I don't see why East would pass with 3 good spades and a maximum|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @D-lead to defeat 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: and even if he pass then West could bid 3@d|pg||
nt|bobh1: W will be thrilled to hear about it|pg||
nt|dburn: rather than guessing whether or not to bid 5@d over 4@s|pg||
nt|mgchat: 3SA serait certainement une enchere plus juste en nord|pg||
nt|ady: but n/s might compet to 3@S|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT looks inv+ |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: presumably this is transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s transfer I imagine.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit I would think twice about bidding 1@S|pg||
nt|400 volt: this is a "boring" 1NT in imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow he bid it!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that on this sequence by W, E will know that W has diamond length|pg||
nt|lml: North is very strong for 2@H if it is not forcing ... I know he has a diamond void but|pg||
nt|riccho: S agrees with your statement here david|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he must have seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
nt|400 volt: (i must admit i would not even think about bidding 1@S :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: If this is the route to 5@D I like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a lucky make next door|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have bid anyway, since she has an above-average hand for hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice 9 count with Hx in @H - worth a try|pg||
nt|400 volt: you will come home with 7-9 tricks anyhow, but not important in IMPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: no more choice of games cue-bids for Brink|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Zimmermann may still be tempted - he ought not to be, but...|pg||
nt|migry: no save now|pg||
nt|pbundy: nope|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if Nystrom didn't like @D - he could bid 3-card major with zero points|pg||
nt|tlc: nystrom's dbl indicates he has passed a likely 6-7 pt hand and wants to let his partner in on the secret..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has passed 1D but now shown some values, so he was willing to play diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: Makes 3 or 4 depending heart guess.  More tea anyone?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 56 is a long day for the WBF - Bermuda Bowl & Olympiad are 48 board days (3 16s). I think that here the later rounds (donàt know what that means though 'R8 or semi) will be 60.|pg||
nt|dburn: ...this indicates that if Drijver had just bid 4@s, East would certainly have bid again|pg||
nt|bobh1: bidding 66 hands is not a science|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing michael will play this one quickly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: Zia in S didn't open his hand next door|pg||
nt|dburn: East might have reopened this, but he is probably too tired|pg||
nt|mgchat: 4SA ?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that à I canàt find the apostrophe|pg||
nt|lml: she might but I think a pass can be forgiven|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think she was (rightly) ashamed of it|pg||
nt|pelu: @C lead and now N easy can play @D = down 1 and "flat" board|pg||
nt|warrens:  doesn't need a @D lead. but needs a @d shift at trick 2 for sure|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: yes commentating is a tough job........|pg||
nt|hedyg: what they dont wont do to prove us wrong..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I might think it, but I;m pretty sure I wouldn't do it|pg||
nt|ady: this might make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 2NT alerted|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H lead may be trouble|pg||
pc|d9|nt|twcho: as confirmed from very reliable source, 2NT is GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Levin thinking|pg||
nt|sharkey: Need a @D ruff to make this - with @C & @S behaving shud make|pg||
nt|ady: dont think can quite  make this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Natural lead. Not sure what the doubled asked for in the other room|pg||
nt|tlc: with some good guessing this may come home...|pg||
nt|milton_se: would pass after one thought :)|pg||
nt|tlc: great @D shift by chris|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is what i call jack denies|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: i understand both tables got there.|pg||
nt|dburn: but of the 150 conventions in the world worse than Flannery, non-forcing responses to weak two bids are a very long way up the list|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahri: east knows west's hand pattern but i believe he's restricted to 8-11 from 1@s initial response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be a heart as we see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these guesses should be indicated|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: agreed |pg||
nt|400 volt: (ok, there have been more than one championship lost by one imp, but....)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: denies both higher and ten :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mgchat: il faut entamer atout|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: N has shown a good hand|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: this isn't the end of the world, of course - down only two, but 4@s was not going to make|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Multon had the decency not to have that @s10, this would actually be a paying sacrifice|pg||
nt|mgchat: le retour atout s'impose|pg||
nt|dburn: doesn't much matter - this is just two down whatever he does, I think|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays a diamond and a 2nd trump comes   then what|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahri: figured out he does not have slam unless west has absolutely perfect hand (AAK) which might be restricted anyway.|pg||
nt|ahri: restricted as in "bid differently" :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Cayne has now taken the lead in his group|pg||
nt|riccho: I think its worth a post mortem discussion if u get in 2@h with 25 combined points here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is often a good holding for notrump. It's a "certain" stopper with LHO on lead if he has the ace and if his partner has it, South must still find the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not here because he had an attractive alternative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS  have no effective options that i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and we get to see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|tlc: ducking the heart was their best chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, nf bids are good|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  I think he can make it if he were to play on clubs before diamonds, since West cant play the third trump|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: i guess otherwise you would defend 1NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4/group advance|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|c4|nt|bobh1: this was best|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, now he had better force the table with a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Multon took an opportunity to strech and served water to all the players.|pg||
nt|dburn: kind of him to give some to Zimmermann in the circumstances|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: He seems to like coloring.|pg||
nt|dburn: Zimmermann needs to duck this diamond and not ruff Brink's card - then, Brink will be endplayed|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will be -800, right?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: now ruff a diamond   but have to give up a club|pg||
nt|ady: now 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: well board 8 is not in yet|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: Belgium on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|pbundy: famous last words|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: forced either to give declarer the diamond suit or to allow establishment of the clubs|pg||
nt|migry: it's nice to have some easy hand for a change - and NS have played every single set in the KO phase so they must be pretty tired |pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: then just another hjeart|pg||
nt|tlc: but even that . no def|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: not quite enough pitches|pg||
nt|dburn: but @dK is three down now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|400 volt: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|400 volt: @H K and two more @S|pg||
nt|dburn: it would not have been 800 if he had done as I suggested - rather a strange sort of endplay, that|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe not as good as flannery, but they cater for a wide range of common hands|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2H|nt|algraves: Mike Lawrence and Anders Wirgren have written a great book called " I fought the law" which i really recommend|pg||

mb|5C|nt|algraves: oh he has heard it before from others lol|pg||
nt|pelu: No - i have to admit - I am not a LAW-man - but here it was correct - a 60% chance :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: jokes apart, I like that book more than LC's 2 books as well:)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|algraves: well the sun came up today and I am commenting on bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: that doesnt mean they are related|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nicely judged by Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: 6 @H is a make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And by Hamman. Good bridge all around again|pg||
nt|algraves: 7@C down 800|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: yes good bridge all around |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves: so -500|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Z gave thumps up to Larry when x|pg||
nt|rv: normally Hamman would expect to go for 300 or 100 in 6@c doubled against making 5@h|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rv: bad luck for Hamman that he is going for 500 here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Break for lunch after this set (15 is the last board). Restart in 1½ hours from now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|algraves: well he had AT is his first suit and 5 trumps in his second|pg||
nt|algraves: he didnt know if 6@C was even going down|pg||
nt|algraves: you basically have to bid there, two many ways to win|pg||
nt|algraves: too many ways to win|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|c3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|algraves: Passing 5@H is losing bridge because you are aiming at only one narrow target|pg||
nt|rv: yes, Hamman would have judged 6@c to be at worst 2 down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: And good players usually don't bid again when they stopped in 5@H. It did not cross Hamman's mind I am sure|pg||
nt|algraves: or making !|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dT|nt|algraves: how can he  tell what the 4 and 5@H bidder has|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in one of the other vugraph matches  China Open 18  vs  Lavazza 9     Lavazza entered the round tied for 3/4   it would be huge upset if they didn't make the KO|pg||
nt|riccho: at least here 3NT is a fine contract|pg||
nt|dburn: they cater for a very wide range of hands where you ought to play in a part score - they make it very difficult to play in normal game contracts|pg||
nt|henryb:  why doesn't he claim|pg||
nt|bobh1: rather an expensive save that|pg||
nt|twcho: should play @c before ruffing a @d|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: ho hum   another 1570 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you have a weird little computer there!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's true, but if you ant to move toward game you can start with 2NT |pg||
nt|warrens:  a heart shift was right if partner had the Ace of hearts and the queen of spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: they may have to rethink this 2@d convention|pg||
nt|lml: www.bridgeblogging.com .. spelling error|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: This is GROUP C|pg||
nt|lml: so Shenking is showing hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: exactly 5H and 4 or more in a minor|pg||
nt|lml: there was one other pair in 2@H so far and one in 6|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: sure you can, but then no one knows whether you are bidding suits or stoppers or anything|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm not sure he "should" play clubs before diamonds, but it works|pg||
mb|4C|an|alertd|nt|marlowepi: aggressive 2N bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no kidding!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not too hard to design a method that handles that|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his black suits in|pg||
nt|yuval10: another 2@c with 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trick here is to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: and we are told that the "save" always goes for 800, as north can pitch a spade away on clubs and then declarer can never get to dummy for the heart hook without suffering a spade ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: overruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: if u lose the preemptive effect of the way other pairs use 2@d and things like this can also happen...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this is one of the exceptional hands with which S should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boring after his recent 5206 |pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I'm sure that on balance there isn't much between the approaches|pg||
nt|lml: with 5-5 that does seem like the right approach although his suits are a bit ratty|pg||
nt|migry: 4@c = splinter, heart fit shortness in @c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: well this is what you get for X with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what the double is about but it may help to get to the slam|pg||
nt|lml: which of course fails|pg||
nt|lml: I am still trying to understand the double.  Maybe he though he was too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a couple of other suits to consider besides spades...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: announced as halftime... noted that these guys are quite ahead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I didnàt see an alert, but often people donàt alert forcing NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so pick one that suits your ... temperament|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had a choice of cuebids -- 2@h is probably natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: did it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: grinder flat hands so far|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: it's correct now|pg||
nt|tlc: on board 9 in the open room, 3NT was made after the A@H was led from AQx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Another strong result for Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahri: very.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s not enough, 4@s too final?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the position was very difficult to see - I was looking at all 52 for a good five minutes before I realised what was happening|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, you're right, gave up a ruff unnecessarily|pg||
nt|sharkey: If @D 4-4 the actual line wud prevail|pg||
nt|warrens:  defense has 4 @C's , 2 @h's and 1 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW may never get in here|pg||
nt|ahri: 4@s should fail too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|tlc: spade cards arent going to excite lew much, altho 11-12 hcp (using the new math) is|pg||
nt|lml: will south sell?|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now if will likely prevent EW of playing their excellent 6@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c looks odd |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yep|pg||
nt|warrens:  because the @D honors were together he could have made it on his line if he had drawn trump before playing clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri: i like how bidding is completely different from other room. minors in action here, majors there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a cheap save vs 4@H (if they find it, but 5@D is also on|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that might happen|pg||
nt|tlc: 4s here should do the trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess it isn't forcing.  Good contract.  More tea :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@D is natural, forcing I was told|pg||
nt|bobh1: on board 8 a pick-up for O'Rourke so that plus the board we just saw will tighten things us|pg||
nt|dburn: I think Drijver has shown both minors with short hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: so Brink intends 4@s to play, but...|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't see any way to avoid that|pg||
nt|pbundy: new leader|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri: 4@h can be set by two diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find 4H dubious. even if pd has 3 hearts, 5D could easily prove a much better game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby just completing his shape with 4@H  -- well 5@H 6+@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 9, but the 10th looks a bit elusive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3 c low pt count|pg||
nt|400 volt: this will be a fast 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: either that or he has forgotten their methods|pg||
nt|dburn: ...Drijver might not (in fact, did not) realise that|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, it was much easier on an @h lead|pg||
nt|daman: will probably lose 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobh1: he had a double game swing available...as it is he will do quite well on the board|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|lml: on the auction this is a lousy slam|pg||
nt|mamos: well this is comfortable --  the teapot is empty|pg||
nt|warrens:  give credit to e/w for getting the defense off to a good start and making it hard on declarer|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Stanicic should have bid 3@H instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not overcall 1@H, so 3@H shows a diamond fit too|pg||
nt|ahri: and almost surely 4 cards.|pg||
nt|ahri: or 5 very bad ones|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria should have considered that Versace thought he had clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: not that the road to 6@h is so easy after 1@s opening by W....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Joe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trick is to hold to down 1 actually|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahri: quite gentle auction here|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is ok although they can make S guess the trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he might have got away with it, because West isn't very likely to lead a club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 5@C?|pg||
nt|tlc: i believe 4h may have been kickback (rkc for diam)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H was KC io think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh could be|pg||
nt|tlc: chip showed 2 w/o in that case|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: otherwise 5C makes no sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is only way 5@C makes sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Marshall typed faster|pg||
nt|dburn: the much-maligned Flannery picked up 6 IMPs for Fleischer, who reached 3NT on board 8|pg||
nt|pelu: look like a @S-attack can defeat - but only a small @S - the suit is blocked: 2x@s - ruff 2x@H and now @C - @Sto A and discard @D and no more @Ss in East|pg||
nt|pbundy: oops; tie it would seem|pg||
nt|daman: only 1 IMP after that lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: If Tesla had got 3@H from partner he would not have sold out to 3@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: well, he did, sort of|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: darn, i was rooting for heart nine return|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: this hand looks perfect for polish @c bidders|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: in the other room, Bocchi never bid with the N hand which I find amazing|pg||
nt|lml: very sort of|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z: it doesn't look nice, D not going down|pg||
nt|lml: I think Fleischer likely has a pickup on board 10 too|pg||
nt|tejjyid: curiously though, it gained them by working as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|twcho: Wolfson has now got a healthy lead of 31 imps|pg||
nt|ady: on hand 10 what happens if hearts are led  and continued at ever opportunity   can declarer come to 10 tricks?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|lml: it is possible that the @CJ would be onside short|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: even so 5@c was rather ambitious imo|pg||
nt|lml: yes the two cooperated to get to high|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are bidding the hand now|pg||

mb|d|nt|rv: Zia will bid 1@h here with longer @ds and GF hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: sry 1@d|pg||
nt|algraves: Meckstroth kicked it in with his 11 count accepting invitation|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzsu: w s talking about last hand|pg||
nt|rv: LC's double shows other 2 suits and fairly safe from an originally passed hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves: 1@H doubled is a night mare|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and NV vs Vul|pg||
nt|algraves: good for Zia here |pg||

nt|pelu: need to discard a @C - but he dont like!|pg||
nt|rv: West is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||

nt|pelu: what would u discard on @DK??|pg||
nt|rv: @s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting, just not a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a cut in communications for all Hamman wants to do|pg||
nt|rv: @SA and @dK, LC will pitch a @S and unblock @CK later|pg||
nt|pelu: Meck in 2@H - no double here - West open 2@D (both major) |pg||
nt|algraves: this is the sort of double dummy problem, or " open cards" that are interesting for you analytical geeks out there|pg||
nt|algraves: do you want to Play or Defend|pg||
nt|rv: @SA and @h back may be best line for declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 2@D = 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|rv: if LC ducks @HA, Hamman can duck a @c|pg||
nt|algraves: PO Sundeling of Sweden is always going around with interesting Play or Defend problems|pg||
nt|rv: if LC wins @HA, Hamman will make 3@hs, 2@cs, 2@s and 2@ds|pg||
nt|algraves: no G I mistyped he is a good friend PO had coffee with him last two days|pg||
nt|algraves: he would like this problem|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: I am still here n thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: thats the spirit , lets get into Play or Defend|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't leave us, Tom|pg||
nt|rv: if LC ducks @HA, Hamman can exit in low @c to score 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|rv: still LC has @HA entry though @s suit is blocked, 1 down|pg||
nt|algraves: well he has 9 tricks if he can get them|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: when I started this I was told I could never leave room until session over so I go to wash room before we start good thing|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves: 1S,1@H and 1@D|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: Now to find the quote key, and I'll have this keyboard all figured out!|pg||
nt|riccho: chagas - levy "avoided" the 6@s slam in Bd7|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West might barely just have bashed something - 1@c (3@c) pass (4@c) would have left Polish bidders in the same boat as natural bidders|pg||
nt|twcho: probably OK, if north ruffs high 3 times  and be able to draw east trump by finessing|pg||
nt|daman: 4 more boards for this session|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzsv: remarks along the lines of interesting hand at the table...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very possible 2 different interpretations of 4@H -- hope April gets the lowdown|pg||
nt|tlc: if lew thot it was a cue bid, then the spade ace was missing..very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Not allowed to ask.  the heart bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|daman: Roman 2@D   4441|pg||
nt|daman: stiff D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: does martel squeak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-15 HCP   4415 minus one card|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahri: another chance for a swing to slovakia, 4@h should make|pg||
nt|ahri: for non-europeans, 17:15 is in 25 minutes :)|pg||

nt|lml: I think passing 2@S on the previous board is a mistake for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: could and probably should have been more interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: but East-West at the other table had a free run, given which missing slam was on the criminal side|pg||
nt|warrens:  rosenberg thinking he's too good for just 3@D, but he doesn't have a convenient call.  Non-vul I'm guessing he settles for 3|pg||
nt|pbundy: wondering if willenken will act here........... guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS close to making 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: it's corrected|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: system is jumping around|pg||
nt|tlc: im sure rosenberg wishes he had a better way to raise diamonds to show his playing stength other than just raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: odds favour a three card diamond suit actually|pg||
nt|warrens:  in a way, this is worse, now 3@D can be just competing, but he could try 3@H if he feels his had is worth it|pg||
nt|warrens:  hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzsv: B asks C if his pass denied 3 @hs and he shakes his head|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@s is forcing then i wonder what 3@h would be over 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: it would have been [a] forcing and [b] a better idea than 4@h, which should be the same hand without @dA|pg||
nt|400 volt: will n/s stop early enough?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: so Martel's tactical 1@H bought the hand for them|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: well I dont wish either team to do poorly.  I am a big fan of Lavazza but go Canucks|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians seem to lack their customary energy in this match|pg||
nt|lml: no matter they will be in this event for a long time|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess they're just relaxing at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: they will turn up the heat in a day or two|pg||
nt|bobh1: a lot of bidding in this room|pg||
nt|bobh1: once again the Canadians are exhibiting a much better approach|pg||
nt|lml: it might play well though|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think its a make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no discussion of result -- the orginal Blue Team taught us that is good for partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2NT by N would have been stronger then 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I had a good time once trying to type something serious on a French keyboard.  Yikes!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Another one-suited takeout double :)  I imagine north will support hearts.|pg||
nt|lml: they may make a few on the good splits|pg||
nt|dburn: well, so would pass have done, but he has improved the contract|pg||
nt|400 volt: but east has no good lead available|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR Cohen in East bid 2NT and then West just 3NT - and S had a bad surprise: @H3|pg||
nt|bobh1: for me the second double is penalty but probably not for them|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahri: chance for down three and an imp for slovakia|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem as if NS has 5 losers in 2@h|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, who jumped to 4@h after his partner's overcall, described that as "doing a Meckstroth"|pg||
nt|warrens:  fortunately for e/w, then have a lot of spots in every suit except @H's, which will make a big difference if they have to play 1N X|pg||
nt|migry: i have to run - it was fun - buy|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye migry|pg||
nt|migry: bye:)|pg||
nt|daman: bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS alerted because it guarantees 4@H    Rod would pull to 2@S with exactly 4315|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: pass was not alerted...I hit wrong key|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh thx Trevor -- but my explanation still stands :)|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php   vugraph schedule|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we're on a break|pg||
nt|pbundy: i just checked the other match.  very close also; zimmerman up by 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri: so it will be 27 or 28 lead on halftime|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Handsome lead going into the last 12 boards|pg||
nt|ahri: ops, two imps :)|pg||
nt|lml: the hearts can set up|pg||
nt|bobh1: that's assuming the first double was penalty|pg||
nt|warrens:  best lead is probably the 6 (or 8) of @S, ducked around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: players taking a short break|pg||
nt|warrens:  to declarer.  then he has only 2 spade stoppers|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Weinstein is lying flat on the floor on his back!|pg||
nt|twcho: what else can north lead except @s?|pg||
nt|warrens:  it was suggested to me that West wouldn't have opened his 11 count without all those spots, which I agree with.  makes his hand much more valuable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken and Levin have left the room|pg||
nt|warrens:  of course, many players like to open light at favorable|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w  |pg||
nt|twcho: probably 1 down if best defense|pg||
nt|ady: anyone any observations on hand 10  I dint think 4@S can make on a heart lead   and continuation?|pg||
nt|twcho: and best declarer play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: tactical, or systemic?|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a good lead, but no natural play for S at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken in thought|pg||
nt|tlc: color me conservative, but I think 4@d was plenty here|pg||
nt|fokal: pas mal :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is definitely an opportunity to get some imps by doubling, though hard for weinstein to see that|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all I'm sorry |pg||
nt|tlc: or 3h if you're going to bid 4@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: the auction in the other room was very weak imo|pg||
nt|lml: the momentum has really swung around in this match, amazing|pg||
nt|milton_se: he'll probably not find KS|pg||
nt|400 volt: i expect east to lead a @H and north to misguess @D, for at least 1 down|pg||
nt|400 volt: B8, E/W are playing 5@H undoubled, too... South lead a @D, so 1 down, too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e talking|pg||
nt|400 volt: if north finds @D Q doubleton, east will be squeezed later. But i would bet much that he will not find|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: holding k s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: put it back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|warrens:  assuming they cash out, -1, wins 3 imps for Cayne|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kareno: With diamonds friendly and the spade guess pretty clear, this can make 4.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: the S hand is too good for a weak jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: McAvoy sorry if this is wrong I have no HCPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but you have distro out the kazoo|pg||
nt|lml: its always good to apologize when you think you are making it|pg||
nt|lml: I never apologize when I think we are going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: much better than being confident and going down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it might be very close now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: jack..|pg||
nt|warrens:  a small spade works well if declarer goes up, but not if he ducks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now Weinstein in thought|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe the @C 8?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin, wow, nice hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: and Senior asked whether Meckstroth had ever done a Zia|pg||
nt|bobh1: whatever their methods are they seem to be too high|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's max HCP -- wonder how much stronger the hand can get  [just kidding  @SQx dubious value]|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: North might have thought about doubling 1@H I suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 2@c bid by E since the double by W is usually mainly for majors and could have a doubleton @C|pg||
nt|lml: but his hearts are a bit ragged|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores are back|pg||
nt|kareno: But not a game to bid even vul, I would say.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: up to now there has been a lot chatting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now everyone is very quiet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: staring intently at dummy|pg||
nt|ady: re all   lost conection|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: Belgians on a role +1 on successive boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you don't think S would have balanced over 1@D-P-P?|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt it|pg||
nt|lml: can make as much as four now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: the -800 was duplicated in the other room|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bobh1: wold passed the 66 hand then balanced after 2@s-4@s with 4N|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzsv: still staring|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|dburn: certainly reasonable, if unlucky|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahri: some people ask what's the halftime score for 3rd place, roland, do you have any info?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thinking about trick 1 - maybe the ten is a better card |pg||
nt|400 volt: west showed he liked @H lead, but would like it with J109, too|pg||
nt|daman: Zia as South is in 3NT in the OR|pg||
nt|pbundy: i was wondering earlier how that contract might fare|pg||
nt|daman: we'll soon find out|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D makes I think|pg||
nt|pbundy: 2@H does not :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough for n/s to get in on this auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: with the 22 @s's this is home free|pg||
nt|daman: hhhrrrmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: most roads lead to 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: desperately seeking tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken thinking|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzsk: interesting bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|warrens:  if declarer had played clubs, he could have removed South's only entry and make the hand.|pg||
nt|warrens:  but he doesn't know the clubs are 3-3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken asking questions|pg||
pc|sK|nt|milton_se: on the other hand, no setting trick unless Hs are good enough|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ??|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm not certain why south rose with the spade ace here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  W could gave covered the heart Q to block the suit, but it wouldn't matter with S still having an entry in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even second diamond strange|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: all aproaches work here|pg||
nt|tlc: it seems are tho leading another club early had to be right...the only spot higher then dummy's @d spots is the jack|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: The Cayne team will happily give away an IMP here and there :)  So this is the antepenultimate board of the set.|pg||
nt|warrens:  now he'll get endplayed in his hand for -300|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he didnt double dummy the @ss|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  playing a second club from dummy was a 2 trick swing on this hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: now a @H?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fokal: he will|pg||
nt|bobh1: a trump coup?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri: a push, so this is the halftime score|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Zia always tells me that you should respond on bad hands if you think the opponents might make 3NT, but not if you don't|pg||
nt|lml: Martel had every reason to believe they could make it|pg||
nt|lml: so he was following the ZIa rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you should follow Zia's advice when it is correct too David, but not otherwise|pg||
nt|riccho: as with every rule... |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I always follow it anyway - I get shouted at less|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|fokal: maybe , if he ruffsa heart he will eventuelly scor all the @s but one|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzsv: giving up the diamond|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: oops|pg||
nt|400 volt: west played good @C|pg||
nt|fokal: for down one|pg||
mc|4|nt|400 volt: to let josef escape from the endplay|pg||

pc|c2|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rv: good for neutrals that Wolfson has made a good start here, Nickell more than capable to wipe out any deficit in last round as history tells us|pg||
nt|algraves: so Meckwell played  2@H down 4 on last deal, Hamman wishing he had passed 1H doubled no doubt|pg||
nt|rv: everyone would like to see a close match till the last segment, this segment sets up match nicely especially with Wolfson having played his customary set and Nickell-Katz yet to ...|pg||
nt|rv: play 2 sets (no disrepect to these players)|pg||
nt|algraves: Pretty exciting bridge here|pg||
nt|algraves: remember the fatitue factor starting to kick in|pg||
nt|algraves: Rosenbloom final is never " well played " as the players are tired|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|s3|nt|pelu: Diamond up against Zimmerman . Fantoni-Nunes bid 6@D missing 2 Aces :(|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c5|nt|rv: Wolfson might just decide to play another set especially since he has had good sets with LC in last few days|pg||

nt|lml: the Italians are being taken minus.  The Canadians already had 25 VP before the last board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am wondering what the balance sheet is on playing superaccept & weak NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should get to slkam here|pg||
nt|kareno: Misguessing spades.  Why?  I think he hopes the spade ace is with east in case they bid the game in the OR.|pg||
nt|mamos: that really didt make much sense |pg||
nt|riccho: yes its so easy to make the mistakes which partner advised to|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, on that hand he'd probably have shouted at me anyway for not raising spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, Zia is a coach? I had no idea|pg||
nt|riccho: no rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not all rubber players give lessons|pg||
nt|riccho: at rubber bridge it pays to punish partner for his mistakes|pg||
nt|riccho: you get him twice back as an opponent|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, de Botton picked up eight IMPs in bits and pieces - six for a fearless balance by Sandqvist on 9 and (remarkably) 2 when the combined 25 count was played in 2@d and not ...|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good buy|pg||
nt|lml: since four of a minor is available north south|pg||
nt|lml: bye now heading for dinner|pg||
nt|fokal: buthe could have made down 1|pg||
nt|pbundy: if south had doubled, he might have had a very big payoff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: Auken has taken over the lead group lead|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR on the earlier hand East just bid 4@d over the heart preempt and will be surprised perhaps ito win imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   [but sometimes 15-17]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this slam can be defeated|pg||
nt|lml: Rayner has moved into a tie for first in the division|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: W led the @c A|pg||
nt|lml: they cashed the @ca at trick one and it was all over|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe at mps that lead is normal|pg||
nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps?|pg||
nt|lml: so we are near a tie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S, 4@S [if Kickback],  what other options?     nope never thought about 4@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy contender for "filthy  overcall of the year" honors|pg||
nt|mamos: just lost an imp|pg||
nt|kareno: I would bid 1nt (if it is in range) with four hearts and diamonds, but not with spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether Katz could double for penalty and chose not to, or whether his double would be conventional|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussion between Katz and Allfrey|pg||
nt|dburn: but North rather than West is forced to bid 2@d on this auction|pg||
nt|pbundy: looks like zia still declaring in the other room.  not an easy hand for offense or defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat vul and always 4th seat  1N=15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why that got alerted - just a limit raise, as far as I know|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@H surely|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a limit raise has become artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: S alerted. however N did not|pg||
nt|riccho: unusual convention |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might, but 3@h may have the feel of a pre-balance, so I guess he could pass|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||
nt|tlc: it has my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute treatment  ---   i was going to guess a version of Swiss with bad trump|pg||
nt|riccho: well done martel|pg||
nt|dburn: he did pass|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: Nickell down 34 against Martens!|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised...was expecting gazzilli|pg||
nt|fokal: tough lead here|pg||
nt|fokal: in 4 @h I mean|pg||
nt|warrens:  Levin-Weinstein play Flannery, so a 1@S response promises 5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|warrens:  here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: leading unsupported aces is not a growth industry at imps|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: i meant|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z's DBL showed a 5 card Major and another suit at least 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: how would 6@D fare here?|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@h, not 2@D?|pg||
nt|fokal: in the 3nt have to guess too|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Stoppers in both majors and hopes for the club suit.  |pg||
nt|kareno: North needed the eight of clubs this time.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'm about to designate Z as the best player to be a VG operator for - he explains things very clearly with gestures so I can figure out what he's said :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, gestures and he isn't even Italian :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: trust your opponents|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@D -1 on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i bet iknow what he will lead|pg||
nt|fokal: here in 4 @h ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: ur right it is tuff|pg||
nt|bobh1: he needs to find a @d|pg||
nt|fokal: he guess it's rather @s than @d since S didn't bid 1@s|pg||
nt|fokal: I guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
nt|milton_se: passed the "making point" now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: bid right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  6@D does make, I take it back .|pg||
nt|bobh1: he follows ur reasoning |pg||
nt|fokal: seems normal to me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=0-6, and this is definitely the lower range of 0 |pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure? all @ss go on @Hs - and now u can ruff 2@Cs in dummy|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|tlc: "last train" for any specs that might wonder means "I want to make a final slam try, but have nothing specific to say without getting past game"|pg||
nt|fokal: I think I would have given the contract to|pg||
nt|tlc: finally an easy hand...easy to bid and make 4@S...the last several have been much more mentally tiring|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be quick claim too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: typically it is an artificial use of the call just below the game level|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they were kind enough to write that one down for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you are the best Operator - you bring the room to life for us as well as following the play and explanations.  I'm always happy to see you in my room :)  Thanks again!!|pg||
nt|pbundy: zia could not find the handle - so - wolfson moves into the lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff one spade in the S hand and one @H in the N hand.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C is a nonforcing-stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e said small w said nothing else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: attacking lead because of the four trumps, trying for force|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||
nt|warrens:  I mean ruff a @S and a @H in South|pg||
nt|xenya: have they located their @D fit?|pg||
nt|warrens:  with all suits breaking, it'll work|pg||
nt|pelu: can u explain the bidding? 2@C prob asking , and 2@H = I have a real opening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: he thought maybe Sementa had the stiff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: certainly is possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: The cards just won't stretch for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes they have|pg||
nt|warrens:  I was told 2@H showed @D's, in which case 3@D established the fit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: remains to make it|pg||
nt|pelu: so 12 IMP to Cayne - and 28-28 - if he make :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: sorry 12 to Wolfson - but 28-28|pg||
nt|warrens:  A reasonable lead, but now this will be easy for declarer.  He has to think about bad breaks, but won't find any.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he is thinking|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzsv: Tough hand to defend though - Z must be worried that another spade will be declarer's 9th trick, not knowing about those minor suit spots in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He can be patient about the spade.  Meanwhile, north is playing on diamonds - if clubs were solid I think he'd be going after his ninth trick in hearts.  |pg||
nt|kareno: South, that is,|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Although, if the @d6 is upside down count, either partner has those higher spots or declarer only has 3 spades (with 6 @ds)|pg||
nt|pelu: only @D 4-1 can create problem|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|tlc: altho the 4-1 spade break will give declarer more to think about|pg||
nt|tlc: need to duck 2nd as well, but it wont matter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just plays side winners to retain control|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for scores, sometimes goes down briefly|pg||
nt|tlc: right,,but ducking will get NS 1 more trick|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: pretty well everything works except two rounds of trump|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: he can claim now so this is about an overtrick...he should just take his 10|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson can pick up spades for an overtrick, but is likely just to lead to the ace|pg||
nt|400 volt: this will be 1 down|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|tokay1975: does anyone know the link for running scores|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ty|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he had better not do anything weird like putting in the nine - but he may believe that West has four spades|pg||

nt|400 volt: but better as 1@C passed out in natural systems :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: really tiring event and test your physical and mental fitness in addition to technical / bridge ability|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: Zia's 2n seems to be old fashioned bal 13-15 GF:)|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: sry Hamman's 2n|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: I dont like 2NT on a 3-card support - with 5-3 u can have a 4-4 fit for slam - not here but..|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I am told that Hamman's 2n shows exactly 3@h GF|pg||
nt|rv: 3@C is help suit in case partner has slam interest|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rv: 4@d here could be now popular last train bid:)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that 3@c and 3@D = 4 card suits, sp they can find another fit!|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Zia's read Hamman's 4@D correctly, is 5 level really safe for their side if Hamman can still have min for GF|pg||
mb|6H|nt|algraves: 6 will make with the @S guess but a little thin to say the least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: not a good slam - need @CK onside at a discard from @S-suit - and no bad breaks - - is it on 20%?|pg||
nt|algraves: yes exactly|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|pelu: tx Allan :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Cohen did not bid 5@D, it's a misclick but the contract is right|pg||
nt|rv: wheels have come off here, I suspect Hamman intended 4@d as last-train bid (some interest, but can't cross 4M level), Zia played him for more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Z said no ply when dummy came down|pg||
nt|pelu: so 11 IMP for Nickell - not so well deserved|pg||

nt|rv: I presume he will cash @SK before taking second @c finesse|pg||
nt|algraves: Zia has not played this correctly , he should have gone over on diamond to if he was going to repeat finesse|pg||
nt|rv: yes, playing second @h catering to 4-1 break in that suit as well was not such a good idea|pg||
nt|algraves: however he can still make it a couple of ways but can no longer ruff club obviously , and remember he does not know @S situation|pg||
nt|algraves: I suspect he will cash @S King now and play for squeees but the Q drops and ends all problems|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with Kibitzer's view that Zia has plenty of squezze possibilities and it was right to cater to 4-1 @h break onside, my apologies for last statement|pg||

nt|kareno: Great slam missed by Belgium in the OR.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z chatting - Z says "I told you at least 5 and at least 4 - had 55" All very friendly by both of them|pg||
nt|kareno: West certainly could have bid 4@c over 3@c by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rob: I made the minimum,  Katz:  min would have been if youhooked the spade nine|pg||
nt|twcho: two more boards to go for this segment|pg||
nt|twcho: when will the next segment start?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next to last board|pg||
nt|warrens:  1300, in 70 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needed to play another club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next to last board of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: would be very inspired to say the least to lead a @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Well done Joe, excellent job|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: the score is now 25 VP for Rayner and only 3 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this Flannery?|pg||
nt|lml: do you like the weak 2 with four cards in the other major|pg||
nt|lml: and in second chair|pg||
nt|twcho: both east open 1NT|pg||
nt|ady: save in 4@S  for n/s  except on club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Zagorin-Bathurst struggled with  11     they also stalled at 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Nystrom remarked.. thinks it was their first constructive auction lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = RELAY, FG  [says nothing about @C]|pg||
nt|pelu: with 4-3-3-3 and ( u sh have a fast pass in N|pg||
nt|pelu: 8|pg||
nt|bobh1: showing both majors? weak?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: no way to find the sacrifice|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: not when the other major is this good|pg||
nt|lml: no it was a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: pretty sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: well way too strong for a multi imo|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D makes it easier to describe the hand later|pg||
nt|400 volt: even if he has 18 and could open 1@C, too|pg||
nt|fokal: I guess so :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW jam the auction effectively|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lml: now some people dont like bidding 1NT in that position as natural but I think it is just fine myself|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT as 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: splinter for clubs thoughg 2C was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i assume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the answers to the relays :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am told i am wrong|pg||
nt|tlc: for partnerships that play Kickback ( a version of RKC where the key card ask is the step above the trump suit) frequently have issues when one partner has both D-H and the other ...|pg||
nt|tlc: believes 4H is Kickback in  Diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am used to it:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Just as it should be - bridge at the highest levels is still a game of gentlemen.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone know the WBF site to follow all the matches?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and ladies :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: so finally the last board of this quarter|pg||
nt|400 volt: but everytime difficult to bid hands with @D in a baltic/polish @C system|pg||
nt|pbundy: another slam - i am betting does NOT get bid|pg||
nt|daman: another breather    2 more boards this set|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mamos: swangames has running scores|pg||
nt|mamos: hang on I'll find addy|pg||
nt|pelu: is 1NT 15-17? - then I dont understand|pg||
nt|fokal: but NS will evantually find 3NT, except if he passes... oh ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: zimmerman 86 strul 39|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from 1@H-2@C   i think 3@D says  5-7 zz points [A3 K2 Q1] with short @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not HCP   zz points [aka AKQ points]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: he did write down 3 - 2 - 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Bertheau has 8   A[3] A[3] K[2]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok thanks.  someone will explain zz points to me at the bar later.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: story i've been told about "zz"    the author didn't know what to call the treatment so used filler of "zz" -- too many people had read draft before official name could be given, ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so zz stuck|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond 115 vito 24|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: Van Cleeff was one of the authors of a book called the Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|lml: apparently someone says they shows both majors 6-11.  He doesnt have that either really|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as multi.  |pg||
nt|lml: now if it show 6/4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty April!|pg||
nt|lml: yes I thought it was that... he loves multi and Mudienberg 2's which came up earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: your welcome. |pg||
nt|lml: April is the best|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose when the smoke clears they will land in the reasoanable 6Cs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next session in 55 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i prefer sandwich but most good players agree with you|pg||
nt|kareno: Try http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|riccho: last bd here for this session|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is natural but unlimited - difficult call for North here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is the auction GF yet?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s was in theory forcing to game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: presumably it is, so 3@C looks OK|pg||
nt|riccho: sandqvist followed the zia rules and bid not only 1@h but raised to 2@s (Bd12) -1 |pg||
nt|riccho: -1 after partner bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia is allowed to pass 1@s if partner will be declarer in four, but partner is not allowed to pass if Zia will be declarer in four|pg||
nt|400 volt: the 4@D bid came from piekarek|pg||
nt|400 volt: we obviously shouldn't compliment our operator so early :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks comfortable - may make five|pg||
nt|400 volt: :) :) :)|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@s is?|pg||
nt|daman: this one has an outside chance of being bid on power|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||
nt|bobh1: when both of the opps have bid, if feel like a sitting duck bidding 1N with this hand|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: @d?|pg||
nt|warrens:  a lot of pairs play 3@S here to show an unspecified singleton or void with 6+ good @H's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: probably undisclosed shortness|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|warrens:  but they may have a different system|pg||
nt|warrens:  if it showed @D's, I would expect Rosenberg to bid 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
nt|twcho: right|pg||
nt|warrens:  confirmed: shows shortness somewhere|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course it is a terrible slam - with that one redeeming feature; it makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how most XYZ/2-way NMV/2-way Checkback players  define  1@H-1@S//1N-2@D//2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 2@D is game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken in the tank|pg||
nt|warrens:  Al, I would define it as concentrated values, such as xx, AKJxx, Kxx, Qxx|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, probably 6C. E will lay down club ace. then NS can both get style points for playing the jack and queen :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only thing known about West hand [without peeking] is that he is Game Force, but not @S fit with shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think this system is designed for E to need to know anything about W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "pragmatic" 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner needs very right cards for 6|pg||
nt|pelu: NV it looks strange - u agree?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  very aggressive nv|pg||
nt|warrens:  Maybe he expected the Italians to invite at the other table and wanted to duplicate the result.|pg||
nt|fokal: seems a good lead for the defense|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kareno: An accurate route to the excellent slam is found by B/K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z, laughing, "invitation"|pg||
nt|mamos: It's difficult to see much future in this match for the Belgians  --  really great  start for Cayne|pg||
nt|kareno: Last board of the set.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of great bridge to come.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now, Z has asked B to show him his hand, so he can claim. Then says something about smoking :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||
nt|lml: I never though of that before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 5@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|milton_se: may even make 6 if going for the Cs instead of D finesse ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thanks all|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... but he'll be content w two S ruffs|pg||
nt|400 volt: Other running scores are available at: http://tinyurl.com/2fuo3ng|pg||
nt|milton_se: thanks joe, mike, felix and all|pg||
nt|twcho: an uptrick|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry, I am not familiar with the system. We are doing the best we can.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice contract -- whatever the auction meant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that would be my guess too, but looking at Willenken's alerted 1N -- was thinking maybe 2@H shows the hand with 1@S and unknown 4@C/@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe they will get there on power.  tho, as larry mori points out - onnly makes on a spade guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I have an auction with explanations from a spec:  the explanations are wrong: 1@C polish, 1@S 7+ 4+@S, 2@D 3+@S GF 2@H 7-9(10) exactly 4@S 4@D splinter etc|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|lml: they need to take their club trick .. yep|pg||
nt|tlc: another "black box" auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: April -- the only thing to apologize for is   apologizing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably natural bidders would get there also|pg||
nt|fokal: declarer is in an awfull bad shape now|pg||
nt|warrens:  Rosenberg-Willenken play 1@H-1@S-1N shows either 2533 or clubs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: I saw a match yesterday where one side was preempted out of the auction when they had 26 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: eddie wold found the @d lead on the previous board|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: page should show the time for the next segment to start|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: And you all thought watching the Phillies was exciting :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made by discarding club on spade and ruffing a club en passent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm glad i brought up the question    turns out  1N=4@C OR  2@S 5@H 33   thanks all for the clarification|pg||
nt|daman: Zia nd Hamman are in slam in the OR|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course willenken doesn't know the club situation at all yet|pg||
nt|pbundy: WOW.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: yes that could work if the cards were different|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS will accept this even tho they had a slam available|pg||
nt|bobh1: a poor slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: its a 1-imp pickup|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hQ|nt|lml: the @H9 is a big card|pg||
nt|lml: the throw-in does not work|pg||
nt|bobh1: not if they pitch correctly|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: thinking very hard about what to pitch|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rv: surely tiredness/fatigue taking its toll on these WC players|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Off 2 keycards for spades here, but the slam is good if you know you have 11 spades between you and that one of the missing keycards is @SK|pg||
nt|algraves: so Hamman and Zia have gone down in one slam and one game they perhaps should have made|pg||
nt|rv: making poetic justice that Zia went down in such a poor slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Chinese women bid it|pg||
nt|rv: maybe poetic justice|pg||
mb|4C|nt|algraves: costing 32 imps|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pelu: ok last hand - no slam: missing 2 keycards - Yes I see that @SK drop - but still u sh not bid slam|pg||
nt|rv: 4@c is fit jump showing @cs and 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Zia not say 1 down when he saw dummy? He was profetic|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: The slam is 52%, Peter, so why should you not bid it?|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@Dx = 800-1100|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: said no ply then found one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem is that you don't know which keycards are missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sorry for spelling, phophetic|pg||
nt|rv: momentum may get them to slam here|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|rv: if they had asked key cards, they would have stayed out, but sometime when opps pre-empt to hilt, sheer momentum takes you 1 level higher|pg||
nt|rv: I think Zia's 5@H is slightly optmistic though he has 3@Cs since Hamman stll needs to cover for @CA, @CK, @CQ, @SK and possibly @sq|pg||
nt|pelu: @DK singleton / @SK singleton - a clue?|pg||
nt|rv: even for a fit-jump that is awful lot to expect from Hamman|pg||
nt|algraves: well the bidding would suggest !K with overcaller othewise 3@D but these days who knows|pg||
nt|tlc: bidding 6@c here is giving zia a chance to pass, which on the auction wouldn't be ridiculous|pg||
nt|pelu: a forcing pass from Zia's hand would be my bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori it's 52-48 for the drop, and even better after Wolfson's jump to 5@D|pg||
nt|rv: I think Zia bid 5@h trying to push and bid thin slam after going down in vul game and slam in last board|pg||
nt|algraves: well 6 @C makes too|pg||
nt|rv: this is last board of first segment, thanks to my excellent co-commentators Roland, Alan and Peter|pg||
nt|rv: also special thanks for insightful comments from wonderful kibitzers|pg||
nt|algraves: perhaps Zia is afraid the Hamman has 31s and 6 @C|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@S|pg||
nt|algraves: and 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And our operator, Tom, has been brilliant. Thanks to him too!|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes Tom is flawless |pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: tks did not do anything but tell u N thinking lol|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|algraves: finally Zia figures it out|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|algraves: now he has a chance to redeem himself from misguess last hand|pg||
nt|passell: he will guess spades for sure  unlikely wolfson bid 5dia with kx of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure Zia will go for the drop|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's better than 52-48 after Wolfson's jump to 5@D|pg||
mc|12|nt|rv: thanks all, see you soon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 35 minutes|pg||

nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: you are funny Hedy... its good to have your around|pg||
nt|marlowepi: font know their style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've just started board  13 so we'll have to wait|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C for me with that shape. seldom any insurmountable pressure where your major is spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: discussing last auction.  bidding showed minimum HCP but extra shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-3@C from Nystrom?     their 2N opening is @C & @D but with 12-15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: worst relay in the system...  laughter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board of this set|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session    good start for Wolfson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board of this set|pg||
nt|daman: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board of this set|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone   thanks specs|pg||
mb|1S!|an|no alert|mb|2D|nt|bobh1: an anemic overcall|pg||
nt|bobh1: trading on the colors i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Linda :) i love it and guess it shows..also fun with you!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed Marshall -- no reason not to show the real distribution  but some 5-card majorites ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks trevor, good job|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks to bbo for making this all possible - and to roland for organizing :)|pg||
nt|daman: Great job Trevor!!!!!   Bravo|pg||
nt|warrens:  another slam hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: back at one 0'clock|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would expect both tables to bid and make this one|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|twcho: yes, a useful lead of 27 imps|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 14 in the OR      the @S Ace was led|pg||
nt|daman: so   no guess needed|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bobh1: so this is a stolen bid situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes even good pairs play "stolen bid"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and thanks to my fellow commentators and spectators for pointing out many variations on play|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: most of those majorites burn to a cinder before they hit the ground|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel can't sit, can he?     for that matter -- can Nystrom?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Mustafa and Phil|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|stc: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the dreaded F word here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the other room East (Baxter) didnt defend quite as well as Sementa.  he failed to keep an exit card|pg||
nt|lml: the British Lions are first in the E division|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ady: this hand    can they find their way to 3NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: a guess needed here :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in  50 minutes|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mamos: these two teams had a tough battle earlier  just one imp|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks like going down on trump or club lead|pg||
nt|tlc: nice balance by chris|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a direct 2@H by willenken would have shown spades as well|pg||
nt|tlc: yes, thx to trevor..and martin..and of course to the multitude in the peanut gallery :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is minors|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: 3NT by W on a 9@d lead in OR last bd|pg||
nt|lml: I mention this because Paul Gipson blogs and he has been giving me a hard time about ignoing him|pg||
nt|stc: 5@c for EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: helgemo in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: it is quite unexpected|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this can make if he knows the heart situation after queen or jack wins  first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: nystrom, comment <should be some useful cards there|pg||
nt|warrens:  even a diamond lead is good enough, just not an @H|pg||
nt|tlc: quite a different sequence that the open room, but the ending the same|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is like news from the gods to rosenberg|pg||
nt|tlc: rosenberg must think theyre playing a differnt board:)|pg||
nt|stc: small ¨c and small @d leads are almost impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: S might have explored 3N as an alternate spot|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm told 3@C=clubs OR one-suited @S's OR strong 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|twcho: OR do have a chance of landing in 3NT but east retreated to 4@s|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@s is stronger than 4@s probably so east has to jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|stc: so 5@d will make for a push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: I hope he does well... I have my favorites|pg||
nt|pbundy: not impossible for this decision to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stc: 4@h also in|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bobh1: i guess he can make this too|pg||
nt|hedyg: dpnt we all?|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont*|pg||
nt|ady: really needs a trump lead     |pg||
nt|tlc: this lead certainly will get the set over with quickly|pg||
nt|stc: as any other lead excepting small @c/ small@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: small diamond tough, but a club lead certainly possible|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: about the last board specs have been pointing out that they acution was different in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: West didn't have a chance to support hearts and it made it hard for East to unblock|pg||
nt|lml: yes the LIONS have a bye this match but that is only 11.5 VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H fixing trump, 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff comercial.  Check out www.bridgetopics.com |pg||
nt|hedyg: 11.5 is an usual score for a bye, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Lauria requested a restroom break...  id offer to fill in but...  :)|pg||
nt|lml: yes but some people suggested the LIONS were helped by it... don't really think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol April|pg||
nt|lml: after all this is over I am going to start reviewing bridge websites in my blog.  There are so many new ones.|pg||
nt|lml: Van Cleeff has one of course and several others|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|stc: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: after the drama from last set...may be a quieter one is looming|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: I don't know if Van Cleeff is on facebook, bridgeblogging is of course|pg||
nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|pbundy: see everyone in a little less than an hour :)  tnx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: restart at 1o'clock...15 more boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  Zia is at the moment of truth in the other room.  If he tries to ruff the 3rd round of clubs, he'll go down.  He doesn't know the spade Q is falling|pg||
nt|warrens:  (on board 14)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 2 boards played below level of 3N!|pg||
pg||
