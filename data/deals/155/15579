mb|p|nt|davidstern: From a beautiful day in Philadelphia|pg||
nt|davidstern: Warm and Sunny|pg||
nt|bobholl: muiderberg ? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|uni_cicam: we are back in 3rd session in Match Martens-NIckell|pg||
mb|1S|nt|uni_cicam: There was probably an appeal in the first round so 9 more imps for Martens team|pg||
nt|bobholl: dekkers knows they have a big @S fit|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|uni_cicam: 3S is a comentator misclick?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Willie from New  York here again.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Joe, our operator|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Stern|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spades seems like a lot of work for 10 tricks in the OR|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H shows 55 an, 2NT asking|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, thanks|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit over strength 2 @H so 6 won't be reached :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 3NT by Kopecky will come|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: brad will surely bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: it is 5@S for the vulnarable NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: He thought about it.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|toral5: 4@S on a trump guess and NO @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice treatment forcing 3@C by partner for this hand anyway|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 9 tricks so we can relax in the second board|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oosmanb: There goes the @s guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was about to ask how about trumps whenever|pg||
nt|toral5: now no guess:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: the defence is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT further explained as try for game, single suited...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: test|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 are easy only looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1st board was +2 IMPs for Nickell|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sure, but Kopecky will not have any problems with making it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Good for him to take some time in the first boards|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: last sessions proved most happend in the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopacky-Kurka are playing ACOL with 5c @S and 12-14 NT, 2 over 1 is 9+|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: 6 @C doubled in other room |pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: should still make 3@S, 4@S would need @h to be picked up?|pg||
nt|toral5: he can make 10|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @S migth have some difficulties :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|uni_cicam: if @H finesse will be wrong, will be difficult to guess @D, but @H K is on side, no problems for Kopecky|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosmanb: For BBO JEC matches fans, Teodorescu is LeRouMain|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: cross ruff works well in 5@S, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: South is the one with most @C (almost ) now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|uni_cicam: every player will duck @H K, is there any other line of play?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: can still loose 3 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: will give ruff :) but nothing essential|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hT|nt|uni_cicam: cant afford to duck @D now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion has a difficult decision now |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think she ''l play a @C to J but just guessing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now Vriend's turn to think|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is almost as good as @C to 9|pg||
nt|bobholl: if fred doesn't ruff he will never beleieve it :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: believe|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange that he doesn't play for @H to be 32|pg||
nt|anton72: just safety play....what is strange|pg||
nt|caitlin: strange|pg||
nt|anton72: your point |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: @H and @D now :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|davidstern: It is amazing how often a trump lead seemingly loses a trcik but comes back in the play|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: good guess|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|davidstern: West squeezed?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: if not cashing @c and play all @H, E will be squeezed in black suits|pg||
mc|11|nt|bobholl: if @H are 4-1 off side yhis will not help :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: rst blodd to hampton|pg||
nt|bobholl: first blood|pg||
nt|anton72: realy?|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 3@c ????|pg||
nt|bobholl: the @H is not a very bad lead just unlucky :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|uni_cicam: without prevention, N raised 1@H to 3@H in Open room, EW makes it a bit harder here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yvesj49: spade is more efficient with partner's double|pg||
nt|bobholl: she can't misguess @D lucky for her|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 3@c openeing in other room is curious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: she is running her clubs quickly and IÂ°ve lost the play, now diamond ace and queen|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT is down after taking @H A, unfortunately no information for S, just a try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck could have started with 5@H - and his quick play of the suit put Kurka in doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it would need to be specifically @HA and @D or 2nd @C and misguess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: at least an imp for NS which is also counting|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|davpro: Good shift, even if wrong here...W will know of @d king (an entry when not giving a ruff). Very good shift even. But not right|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 1@H-1@S-1NT will come|pg||
mb|1N|nt|uni_cicam: what then?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=5+@H  9-16 HCP |pg||
nt|ahollan1: first time i've mentioned this week --- Kaplan Rubens hand evaluator says North worth 15.65|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: check out http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?   kool tool to see how small things change the value of hand|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: so almost like a Q :-)|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, @H unbid and got lead into the AK1072|pg||
nt|yvesj49: part score in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H, 2N or 3@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: since 1@H=4+  Kurka using some form of checkback -- but with 4333 many wouldn't bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to find @C lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: but they have only 8 tricks so ?!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: sorry  3@D was typo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ralph Katz will rebid @S so they should reach 4@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: nope -- i didn't think about 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe max 1@S bid with BOTH decent @S AND @D support??|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: showing 3S also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar to  5 where Rodwell didn't stayman with the same shape|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: These are boards 29-42 of a total 56 to be played today in a bid to reduce the field from 32 to 16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is catching up   on  8 Zia IS in 4@S  -- waiting for opening lead from Kurka ..... @C6|pg||
nt|davpro: Declarer will play that suit trick two. Difficlut to find @h shift (could even duck)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me 3NT in other room|pg||

nt|davpro: Only 3 @s tricks (at most) I mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|uni_cicam: trying for an overtrick might be dangerous if E wl ruff third @S, cross to partner by D and get promotion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will Martens enter the auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now or later??|pg||
nt|yvesj49: how many boards ?|pg||

nt|bobholl: think this bergen but a little heavy|pg||
nt|yvesj49: little....|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 15 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Anyone know if 2@H opening in OR showed a 2-suiter, or did east just solo into phantom save?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now!|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Martens opened 2H with E hand here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: next question -- can Nickell now bid 3@D without creating force??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if he does -- Katz may actually try 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: their NT is 14-16 so normal bidding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzsx: typically lead forth |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: fourth.. watching the table more than the keyboard today...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: This should make|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: yesterday the women (quarter final) played 15 bd segments, the men 14|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|yvesj49: but with trumps 4/0|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @H mor tactical :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: but how often would that happen  --- and how many pairs let west bid 3@D |pg||
nt|bobholl: more|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|davpro: It wouldn't matter- small or high- Moss would always grab ace and play @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: is the 4 of @C not normal here ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|uni_cicam: will be hard to make it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes Michal :-(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: declarer can't win|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@s possible to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: or 5 clubs|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Marion disapointed by the 4/0 break|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oosmanb: smooth duck by cornel|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: is there a chance? cashing @H and escape with small @C?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: West needs to duck now|pg||

nt|davpro: I'm guessing lenght at trick one...and lavinthal with the 2|pg||
nt|caitlin: Meckwell also playn14-16 in some seats; it can be the hardest for opponents because do they step in if the 1NT is 16 or not step in if it is 14|pg||
nt|davpro: Normality doesn't excist :) I'm living proof :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: Back and forth :)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but, not knowing about 66 shape, he can run !A first|pg||
nt|othered1: did west have to win that and play @C?|pg||
nt|warrens:  if declarer cashes a heart and ducks a club, I think he makes it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: @D got set up for declarer infact|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Milan - what would Kurka open with 4@S333 and 15-17 points?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: As I was saying, for us mere mortals 3NT seems hard to find, but at this level all 32 teams ARE capable of finding the 9 trick cold game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I had pharmaservices this morning.  a very nice pair from Denmark...  |pg||

mb|r|nt|oosmanb: By our very soon Dutch correspondent , van Spoookyyyy, aka Gerbrand Hop|pg||

nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: trump lead beats|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: a fredin redouble |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
nt|davpro: a blind lead somehow. Didn't hit the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult and costly lead problem (@DA could be my choice)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
nt|yvesj49: possible to play on @c !!!!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
nt|davpro: Moss might be concerned about @d 3-0, but in that case S would probably have led trumps...so he should relax :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: begin with @S is bad :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: she did'nt put the 10 ??????|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||

nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is getting harder and harder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: J@H discard will scare him alot|pg||
nt|davidstern: North Pitches a heart the @C10 may come into play|pg||
nt|spooky: even if North discards @HJ he still has no choice does he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should be OK @HK pitch last spade and club honour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well he can try ruffing @H high|pg||
nt|davidstern: But this would be down if North held @CA10x|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and then playing another @S|pg||
nt|spooky: did you see another line David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could just play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Leave all dummy's trumps intact|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lots of entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That would work too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway did well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: but your trumps in your hand are quite bad...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I can see the wheels turning in their heads..  we could be in for a long night at this rate. :)|pg||
nt|spooky: so a possible overruff with @C10 is still there|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I am off leave you in very capable hands. Most of the matches are close to conclusive but one or two still in the balance|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he means your hands Spooky|pg||
