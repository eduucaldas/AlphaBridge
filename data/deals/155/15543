nt|ahollan1: since Bates-Sontag used to play together maybe we can extrapolate|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: Hi all we are going to have some fun here tonight.  |pg||
mb|3H|nt|oosmanb: By our very soon Dutch correspondent , van Spoookyyyy, aka Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|oosmanb: own*|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||
nt|spooky: hi Jean|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen up more staring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6430 possible?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: probably wouldnt bid 3NT with that! :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davidstern: Just for my Australian friends watcching: Ish/Ash 61.61% Nye/Bobby 55.62% Michael/Stephen 53.5%|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry but I have been receiving so many requests for pairs results|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot of ways to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no problem David. We like to hear results!!!  |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|davidstern: No way to avoid 11 I would say|pg||
nt|davidstern: But of course declarer doesnt know that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: Now he will|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is getting harder and harder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: J@H discard will scare him alot|pg||
nt|davidstern: North Pitches a heart the @C10 may come into play|pg||
nt|spooky: even if North discards @HJ he still has no choice does he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should be OK @HK pitch last spade and club honour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well he can try ruffing @H high|pg||
nt|davidstern: But this would be down if North held @CA10x|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and then playing another @S|pg||
nt|spooky: did you see another line David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could just play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Leave all dummy's trumps intact|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lots of entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That would work too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway did well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: but your trumps in your hand are quite bad...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I can see the wheels turning in their heads..  we could be in for a long night at this rate. :)|pg||
nt|spooky: so a possible overruff with @C10 is still there|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I am off leave you in very capable hands. Most of the matches are close to conclusive but one or two still in the balance|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he means your hands Spooky|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: should be a straight forward 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: something about distribution and false cards...  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: depending on style 1NT or 1@S here |pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 4@D is slam try|pg||
nt|warrens:  Sontag still trying, so now Berkowitz has to like his hand a little now: 2 trump and an AK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at both hands, it seems 6@D has plays -- with trump lead take finesse in both majors, without trump lead just finesse @S ??|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|an|5 likely|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|spooky: I think Sjoert will bid 6@D at some point|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|an|?|mb|p|mb|5H|an|shows 1, I think|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
mb|5S|an|shows 1|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: you are very slow here ! even Fantoni finished already|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosmanb: !!! :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: played a tough 6@d|pg||
nt|warrens:  the score is off by 22 imps, so O'Rourke leads by 16|pg||
mb|1N|nt|spooky: Some though boards..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you guys mustve missed that board :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 16 lead I'm told|pg||
nt|spooky: 16 all helpfull kibs tell me|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 131-106 25?|pg||
nt|spooky: 1NT wouldn't be my choice|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh that's through 10 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, it's 11 from O'Rourke and 11 to Meltzer, so 131-115|pg||
nt|spooky: Thanks Warren :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|oosmanb: I'm surprised that this 4@S actually made at one table|pg||
mb|3H|an|spades|nt|spooky: 4@D is the max at this board, but they might sac again against the game|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H is @S's|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H=transfer to @S's here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was played by W as here, the lead was @s to the king and a @s came back..........|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
mb|4D|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Ok, a couple of kibz confirmed, THANK you,|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it was a 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lets see how this goes|pg||

nt|oosmanb: if lead is indeed 16|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they make this|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could brink shift to a @C after he gets @S ?|pg||
nt|spooky: why would he? |pg||
nt|oosmanb: would the Q@H there have been @D Spooky? instead of 9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he bid diamonds twice right|pg||
nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: plus the @D bids ..|pg||
nt|spooky: the only chance for West is the @SK onside, if South ducks it once, he might end going -2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: south will duck|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: I bet he won't|pg||
nt|oosmanb: he has only 2@C, its not like @D will get discarded..|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not quite sure G, maybe the director has been lingering around?|pg||

nt|warrens:  if 3@C is non-forcing, I would expect him to bid it, but not sure how they play it|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed, an agressive 2@S by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that matter   is PASS such a terrible option  ---   tough hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I like it|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 4@C with good defense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: another interesting question   when playing Support DBL -- do they apply when RHO bids Partner's 4+ major   or should it revert to takeout [especially playing big club]|pg||
nt|warrens:  so this bid will work out well|pg||
nt|warrens:  I play it as showing a strong hand unless 2@S shows a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Warren -- do you play as big club?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i agree  when RHO bids partner's major NATURALLY - DBL should not be Support DBL   [thanks for asking Andrew]|pg||
nt|warrens:  not usually, but I have.  I played it in the US Team Trials as my first serious attempt and never worked so hard on a system in my life.  took a lot of energy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Starting score here was 108-97 in favor of O Rourke|pg||
nt|warrens:  the score overstates O'Rourke's lead by 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing that the set score is 16-0|pg||

nt|oosmanb: got an early warning|pg||
nt|spooky: it has been warned after the 1st hour of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: the director was parked here the last board. that was the second warning|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|an|clubs|nt|warrens:  in that case they have to be careful.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|spooky: 2NT transfer to @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: checkback style transfer to @C|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I once played a match up 13 with two boards to go, thought my opponents might be able to win it (based on my last two results).  they didn't play the last 2 boards well and got penalized for slow play, so we won by over 40.  penalties can swing |pg||
