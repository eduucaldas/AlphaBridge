mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: what's too high?|pg||
nt|spooky: 6 something?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: aggresive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Willie from NY here. Hello to all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: city|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Queens, NY|pg||
nt|peachy: I am actually not surprised at the lead, trump downt seem indicated, and leading minor is a guess ehich one she has|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Willie :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I am trying to make the operator shut down but no luck|pg||
nt|peachy: pardon my typing :(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|spooky: I think Sjoert will bid 6@D at some point|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We need the open room up first with the correct score|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: W asking 7 -5? or just no to partner|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|spooky: only -1 Oos?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I wish he/she would read on the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: what happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I wrote a novel|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You must shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: because the score is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Please|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Somehow I feel I am wasting my time|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|rado: N-S use sophisticated prec @C , EW tooo in my memory from last days|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: still two clubs to lose, making this 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: OK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: or the Dutch equivalent|pg||
nt|pelu: the @S-finess looks ok - dont know @Ds 4-1 so he can lose to @SK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: as expected!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes I think this is best. ruffing second one with 10 anyway, so you'll be fine|pg||

nt|peachy: 3NT is a reasonable contract as well but U like 4H better, knowing that opener does not have a 4-card major, she should have xx hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|spooky: might be hard for EW to locate their @C fit now|pg||

nt|rado: @H sevrelat hand types|pg||
nt|rado: several|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Larry Mori|pg||
nt|joest: now 1NT would be 17-19|pg||
nt|joest: what 'double' would be is somewhat more obscure|pg||
nt|peachy: decision for North - try for a major suit or transfer/show diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
mb|d|an|alert|nt|lml: I dont think the French ladies play Bergen|pg||
nt|larrymori: flat but with 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: would you know opposite your best partner? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I like this approach, just pass whatever South bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C is ambitious, i would be getting out to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: easy decision, bid 2@C and pass any response|pg||
nt|peachy: Under WBF alerting rules, 2C (Stayman) is alertable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol, Stayman would like that|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|joest: hey there Henry|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|henryb:  High quality commentary group|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Real score is 53-115|pg||
nt|joest: now that you're here, yes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: me either :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|spooky: unlucky lead |pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead :(|pg||
nt|rado: declarer should take @H finesse to make|pg||
nt|rado: 2@H much better spot |pg||
nt|joest: Helgemo thinking about a game try.  That might be debateable white with a superstrong NT behind you|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: there is something to be said about simplicity though, anything not natural alerted, but many jurisdictions have excluded Stayman from the alert|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the down side of 2@C, leaves partner in the dark|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't know there was anyone above the level of EasyBridge who doesn't play it :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think North changed horses midstream, ie. strayed from original plan|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: vul, she should pass 3@C and say a silent thank you to opps :)|pg||
nt|peachy: There was a risk that S would bid 3NT, then what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: may not even be permitted in France :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: not a great hand to lead from..|pg||

pc|s3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||

pc|d4|nt|larrymori: if he had done the @cs and then a heart to N, endplay|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: same missed game at other table|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: Once you start 1NT it is probably impossible to get to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if partner super accepts transfer you may as well bid game though|pg||
nt|lml: so Hampton has pulled away a bit|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|lml: but a superaccept really shows 4 not 5|pg||

mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@C=12-14 balanced or 15+ @C's or 18+ any|pg||
nt|spooky: 1@D=0-6|pg||
nt|rado: hard bid for S now|pg||
nt|rado: 2@h, 1NT or Drury|pg||
nt|joest: how many commentators favor double over 1@h here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would double, but 1@h is not so bad either|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|joest: easier to bring spades into focus.  A tad under strength if you're forced to bid hearts|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: yes but vul game swings me to aggresion|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@H is 3+@H I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most remarkable board in the previous set was 6@D making when one opponent had @DAx the other one stiff king|pg||
nt|joest: bidding hearts then doubling tends to show only three spdes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps one try for slam with north hand|pg||
nt|peachy: both 3NT and 4H are fine contracts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|joest: this would appear to the appearance of a rare animal these days|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the otherhand, 9743 looks likd a 3 card suit|pg||
nt|joest: the 'natural 2NT" in competition!|pg||
nt|larrymori: no kidding|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spooky: Drijver might double now :)|pg||
nt|rado: other room may present different bidding and contract|pg||
nt|joest: good point henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@h now shows some extras.  Garner might well kick it in here.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: he's had enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: how does this play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: i see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@H 2@C 1@D|pg||
nt|spooky: for NS or EW?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|joest: this doesn't look like it will fetch|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he can divine to sneak the 9@s through...|pg||
nt|joest: they are in the same contract next door though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: snap|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Jack is too fast|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|spooky: he doesn't have an entry to finesse @HK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 7 tricks for NS |pg||
nt|oosmanb: same thing|pg||
nt|pelu: 7½ for NS|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this defence couldve cost though if declarer had A@s |pg||
nt|oosmanb: now he has extra @D trick set up?|pg||
nt|spooky: defence has 4@S 2@D and 1@C already... |pg||
nt|oosmanb: although im playing DD, will paulissen play K@C and @c to 10 and then @H finesse??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or give an open @H trick?|pg||
nt|pelu: but I expect that NS are dorced to give an entry to dummy in @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this can get ugly|pg||
nt|pelu: first NS has to find the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: what to play now in N? @SK? only DD u can play @S5|pg||
nt|spooky: let's say north plays @SK, with this @S's in dummy declarer is almost forced to take the ace|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|spooky: @SQ, 2nd/4th through declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzsx: done.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute defence by Brogeland in the open room (did not matter though)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spade to the jack and queen and a *low* club|pg||
nt|joest: that would beat it if south had had the queenof diamonds with his other goodies|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes, the question with 46 would he just bid 1@s?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: so this one is heading down|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|spooky: looks like it's made now|pg||
nt|pelu: close to make now - Play @CK!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Squeezes dummy if he plays @D first! (but still makes)|pg||
nt|pelu: max down 1 if East play @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant take @D7 - will in a strange way squeeeze dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: this board totally shows that defending is way harder than declarer play, 1Nx= by North on the other table..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen down, more questions by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: for those just joining us the posted daily totals are incorrect.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: we believe the real state of the match is 123 (OR) to 97 (Meltzer)|pg||
nt|pelu: I have tryed to follow the play in OR - but that dont make sense - sh be down 1 with that play - but prob a mistake by operator in play|pg||
nt|spooky: if Paulissen plays @CK now it will be 8 Imps to Meltzer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he will.. doesnt lose much|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes if its ducked he'll gulp and play another one|pg||
nt|chick: if the 2@S bid showed game values and a worthless doubleton, as I suspect, then S should look at the @SAK and bid the @CA on the way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|larrymori: with all that?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oosmanb: hmmm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has to throw @S now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and can actually make an overtrick!!! @h now coming in|pg||
nt|joest: over a redouble, he might have to since jumps are weak|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|spooky: did south throw a trick now? (the @H?)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: oh oh|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: wrong attempt at endplay|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
nt|spooky: so after all 1 imp to O rourke|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S more likely shape ask, anybody know|pg||
mc|12|nt|peachy: Some people have agreed that after opener shos a major, the other major is a slight slam try|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jeanhari: dbl should show some extra's |pg||
nt|danilo1: easy to bid ... but ... will it be easy to make?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: south alerted the double as "max": north as 3 spades|pg||
nt|danilo1: according to 4@H, Dble looks like support|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: just so ? ... not even try 7?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: it does.  the written note I can see clearly says only "max" but she may have whispered "3 spades"|pg||

nt|lml: hard to get there I think|pg||
nt|lml: lets see how they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: same contract likely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helgemo transferring to his diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anti-percentage grand slam, but only slightly so|pg||
mb|5D|an|alert|nt|joest: note that the sandwich 1NT was strong|pg||
nt|joest: many paiirs used to play it takeout|pg||
nt|joest: these days, with people opening and responding on nothing you can't afford to play that way (IMHO)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: Brink like to bid 2@Hs again :)|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess they are set for game now..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: still 2@s 1@D 1@C minimum?|pg||
nt|peachy: This should be Exclusion RKC|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like exclusion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: great hand for it if you have a tool afterwards to ask for club control|pg||
mb|5H|nt|oosmanb: I dunno just saying|pg||
nt|lml: do you agree with Willard's pass of 1@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@H myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They open on 9 and respond on 4|pg||
nt|joest: right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@H does not fit|pg||
nt|peachy: There is always a potential for misunderstandings how to respond to Exclusion, unless firmly agreed.  Just "excluding " diamond ace from the numbers is not always enough of an ...|pg||
nt|peachy: agreement. 1430. 0314, how to show Q etc|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|oosmanb: even against a 7 carder it has no chance, so against a 6 carder...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here they bid game either way it seems|pg||
nt|lml: now if Willard had bid 2@H it would have been a touch harder|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be a push at 110|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: Is the @SA never onside at you oos?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south thinks hearts agreed|pg||
nt|peachy: I like this auction better than the other room, where there was a jump to 6S|pg||
mb|7S|nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: 3@H might have had some different nuances|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: guess my usual trump lead out of the question|pg||
nt|peachy: Well done ladies, now just bring it in :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: ok @SK = the 8. trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: interesting play by helgemo|pg||
nt|peachy: as long as no singleton club with opponents, the dummy trumps are good anough to suff three clubs, toss one on diam ace and take the rest|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: good double from Paulissen |pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: 2@H least likely to push opponents (in my view)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: aggresive but will give much needed imps|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: so really this is moving along now.  They are a fair bit ahead of the most of the field|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell down 30 and probably out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Break time:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond leading lavazza by 23|pg||
nt|lml: too bad in a way I like watching them.  But then again that keeps fred geoff and the rest in it|pg||
nt|lml: and they are terrific to watch|pg||
nt|lml: I think Nickell lost quite a bit when two team members died, Soloway and Freeman|pg||
nt|lml: Soloway and Hamman had a very good partnership and I dont think Hamman and Zia have quite found their groove|pg||
nt|lml: and Freeman was such a terrific player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very true|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the Diamond team is a fairly new construct and a force to be reckoned with|pg||
nt|lml: for a long time no doubt|pg||

nt|Walddk2: An IMP after all|pg||

nt|larrymori: there are daily bulletins available online|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vell done|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 5 boards left for Meltzer to try their best|pg||

mb|2C|nt|spooky: so 5@C-4M or 6@C 11-15|pg||
nt|lml: well one of the top few anyone :)|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 @s ia suction|pg||
nt|anton72: @c & @h or @s & @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: preasure bid from popov|pg||
mb|3C|nt|oosmanb: and this is an opportunity!|pg||
nt|lml: Cronier has a huge hand and she will proceed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if they get to slam i will be impressed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although after this bid looks easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: 6 @h will be good |pg||
nt|anton72: for BUL :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: boring pass :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: hmmm|pg||
nt|pelu: almost only a 4 card  @C-suit :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: needs @d lead to beat?|pg||
nt|spooky: Drijver needs to find the @D lead|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s may well be strength ambiguous if it promises 5 (and if 2NT denies four)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: wow Jan probabaly ecstatic at that lead|pg||
nt|lml: once South bid 4@S showing at the very least good spades North was getting to slam... seven may be tricky|pg||
nt|lml: so do you want to be in a grand missing Qxxx of trump?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a 7 you really want to bid, when 6 easy to miss|pg||
nt|lml: I can say this and you can't ... especially in the women's game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in bridge world are grands common after opponents open|pg||
pc|s2|nt|oosmanb: but far from over|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i meant not easy to bid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can throw dummy in the bin, but declarer has enough tricks in his hand unless he gets a diamond lead (unlikely)|pg||
nt|joest: feels like Helgemo is ready for hearts.  I think Weinstein will stay off a heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: Gier will think this one over for a while -- as would anybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead, yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: very|pg||
nt|joest: if he hops ace, he will still need to be thinking about which round suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni led a heart|pg||
nt|joest: and of course Weinstein might be trying to talk him out of the spde finesse at trick one|pg||
nt|joest: so there is a lot to think about|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosmanb: needs to play on @H not @C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oosmanb: and he will probably go wrong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: its too double dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: I think you'll always play on @C|pg||

nt|oosmanb: ofcourse|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 33 and you're home |pg||
nt|oosmanb: btw can still be home|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: so she correctly I think bid 6 knowing that they were off the trump queen|pg||
nt|anton72: expecting claim = after trumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: South needs to not panic and cash anything|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is the right spot and well done|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh my|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now @d can be played through|pg||
nt|spooky: I think Bas should be able to find the @D now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: For sure|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I dont see declarer making in any case, he'll still play on @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so he'll use @d as entry himself|pg||
nt|pelu: only @H back will now give 3NT|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he takes it and pitches a @h then @cs are safer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzsx: asked about lead of 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: brink will be very happy with that switch|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||

mb|5S|nt|jeanhari: no pure restricted choices as south could also have JTx|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|danilo1: true .. but .. there is hope :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|nt|jeanhari: gran slamtry...dont think its asking for kings|pg||
nt|danilo1: but I believe that superior 7NT will be bidden rather than 7@D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 6NT obvious now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: bad diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: yes, but partner has the KQ with 3 (I assume from the 3@H bid).   6N is wrongsided and would go down if @CK were offside and diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: might go down I should say|pg||
nt|fokal: it's not a restricted choice if I may interrupt|pg||

nt|oosmanb: rather unlucky layout|pg||

nt|joest: i'll be surprised if it's not the same in both rooms though|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 5@C makes??|pg||
nt|pelu: so max on the board is 4@C - and now we are on the 6-level :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: if the 3@s bid is distributional then one of the Ks rates to be useless|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no fooling around on this auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very hard if not impossible to determine if 7@D on, especially if 3@S showed actual shape|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: 3NT by West would have been fine too|pg||
nt|lml: but this seems more normal|pg||
nt|peachy: NT would play bette/be safer from West, but sincethe CK behaves, this is fine too|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|spooky: this is quite typical for Drijver and Brink, always presure on the table|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|spooky: a bit to much now tho|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: possible plus for EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||

nt|larrymori: is this both minors F|pg||
nt|joest: we just changed that|pg||

nt|joest: 3@d = both minors gf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a state-of-the-match 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't fetch|pg||
nt|joest: but I think 3@h is still 3-1 in the majors, so you be the judge. I had though 3@d was 5-5 but what do I know?|pg||
nt|larrymori: i think it is ambitious|pg||
nt|joest: I have no idea what 4@s is.  That one is a mystery.|pg||
nt|larrymori: rkc?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||

nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
