nt|400 volt: E/W playing a (11)12-14 NT, 5c M, 1@C is forcing for one round, can be a strong hand, but not all|pg||

nt|twcho: if @h10 return, it is highly probably Yeung is leading from Qxx|pg||
nt|athene: not trivial to reach that slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far the Bramley team is giving one of the favorites a run for their money|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi all|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|twcho: instead of 10xx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: original 4th best|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: some trump support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: yes, still it conceals some vital information|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Nickell alerts the 3 @H bid and Chiu takes back his pass card and puts it in his box|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: 3@C must show both minors|pg||
nt|Gerben42: italian standard is gadgets in a 2/1 context|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: 1@C = 2+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: unless it's just natural and 3@D is a transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: 21 to 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: 3 d is one major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: ok so 3@D shows one major, not necessarily forcing to game - and 3@H or 3@S would be forcing?|pg||
nt|milton_se: the H suit is the key to this|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: everyone deep in thought looking at dummy |pg||
nt|milton_se: if East covers, South should finesse for the 10, but if East plays low?|pg||

nt|400 volt: 1@C-1@D-2@D is artificial GF|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|ybob: 3@C sort of puppet ?|pg||

nt|milton_se: but there are possibilities for the def to go wrong ...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: east has staymaned, does not like @hs  thus he has @ss|pg||

nt|peachy: http://www.worldbridge.org/bulletin/10_1%20Philadelphia/pdf/Bul_06.pdf  Today's Daily Bulletin from Philadelphia|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell and Katz have called hte director because apparently Chiu opened 1 @c with 2 clubs|pg||

nt|ritong: ty roland|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|athene: very awkward for west - he can't play another trump OR attack hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Maybe it was a weak 2 to begin with but that is beside the point. Stand by your opening|pg||
nt|ybob: too much, 2 K's out to weak opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: still in slow down, I did not see the xx|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: back|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: South was likely denying 3 spades|pg||
nt|lml: I see no reason for north to bid again|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: one play to the loo  and others getting water etc  |pg||
nt|lml: ah the comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: we are in a slow down here |pg||
nt|Gerben42: before half time even|pg||
nt|lml: when you got to ...|pg||
nt|ritong: a close decision|pg||
nt|ritong: but not-so-close|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Ferraro doesnt want Bocchi to bid just now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bocchi has shown his hand|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like 7 tricks for north south but maybe they will find an eighth|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: bocchi asking questions of Morgan |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: lots of writing  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe Bocchi will try a 2nd round of @C at some point that will be 8...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: or declarer can play it himself|pg||
nt|lml: best approach is to just lead trump|pg||
nt|lml: for the defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: works once - then he's out|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe there is a scramble of some sort|pg||
nt|lml: the club ruff might be possible|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: we are still thinking |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: we will never know - but this will be down for sure|pg||

pc|d7|nt|lml: west hand is pretty pathetic in clubs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats why he never bid :)|pg||

nt|lml: that tight spade slam done them in|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|pelu: would a jump to 3@C be forcing or could East bid 3@C over 2@S?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but getting back some here is my guess|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: the dreaded 200|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c would be GF|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||

pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: top and bottom or astro cue bid|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ritong: michel has an excellent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: that was a good board for NS not easy to reach 3N there |pg||

nt|Gerben42: 2N minors?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: thats better, i was trying to work out what the alert was|pg||
nt|pelu: semanta also in 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: if the alert shows 4@H why bid 2@H as W?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: hand looks ok to defend NT for sure|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after forcing 2@D that surprises me|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT can win - spec if decl strat the @C-suit with @c4 against dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: here I prefer a little twist on "lebensohl": 2NT ask for preference in minor!|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 2 diam was 6 of either major|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: question is: is it biddable? i doubt it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: gambling 3N?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this layout is why you lead the J or 10 from that heart holding|pg||
nt|pelu: if all the blach HCP was A'es and not KQ - then there were 9 toptricks after a @H-lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u have 11 HCP in black - and only need 8 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: but sometimes opponents dont have what they promised|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually does :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: what values were promised by Souths bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: to me, not much|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural system bids 2NT in south, swish|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gluckenval: ti deve giurare che non romperà più le palle, per farlo venire a salso, ne su BBO nè tantomeno a Salso stesso :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: only 6 card @D - but he could have passed, so N can exp some values|pg||
nt|gluckenval: sry :)|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: rather take the ruffing spade finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but he is hoping to scrambe a fast 8|pg||

nt|400 volt: This board is a funny one, too... 25 HCP E/W, but 3 NT far from makeable|pg||
nt|400 volt: it's a good score for E/W, if they're only 2 down in 3 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Chagas has put away his glasses|pg||
nt|400 volt: many 3 and 5 downs|pg||
nt|hedyg: but the CR only -1! this is not cross imps :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: yes, Bessis/Bessis will win IMPs on this in the butler-ranking :)|pg||
