mb|2H|mb|4C|nt|chick: X is probably SOS since they are playing weak NTs|pg||

nt|chick: that would make E happy :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am told that N is by far the youngest on the team |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also defeat 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I must say I know very little about either pair |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|chick: Perhaps, but often the opps will be more likely to defend 1NX than to double 2 of a minor for penalty|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after a @h support from E, I think that 4@d is a superior bid|pg||
nt|chick: Certainly if you are going to bid again, but apparently W didn't want to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Some specs will lead @hK! agree, a nice lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: e pulled K of H then put it back|pg||
nt|chick: if he had led it, would clearly switch to diamond at trick 2, but still doesn't beat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: w thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but after that EW has taken their 3 red tricks, there can be a guess in  trumph|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: sure, and when one of the QJ falls, he may take the restricted choice finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now n thinking|pg||
nt|chick: Running scores here:  http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|chick: The danger of course is that a diamond switch is obvious if the spade finesse fails, so maybe he will just go for the drop|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|chick: and of course what you really want at that point is for the opps to rescue you :)|pg||
