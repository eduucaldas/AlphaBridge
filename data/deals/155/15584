nt|vugraphzta: and we start now|pg||

nt|jkotor: prec style 2@c 11-14, 5+ unbal|pg||
nt|toral5: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Nickell in front for a change|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||

pc|d6|nt|toral5: in the other room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: in CR 3@S played in S and killing defense: @d( to K - and duck!|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Helness in the tank|pg||

nt|ady: in fact  as pointed out   still in time   trump now   and overruff table and 2nd trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman stil thinking|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jkotor: if @d 4-1, he would ruff one|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: EW will want thirteen more like this one, please|pg||

nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
mc|10|nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphztb: the board was reversed and then placed the right way|pg||
nt|roswolf: this|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth asks for the Multi defense when Robinson bids 2 @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final 15 boards of the Rosenblum (Open) Quarter Finals   we're playing the same boards as the McConnell (Women)  Semi-Final|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be bid to game as well especially if e/w get too active|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D has no strong options   always  weak @H or @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckwell play the option 2 defense to Multi, or did in previous matches|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|vugraphztb: normally 4th leads, might be 2nd from a bad suit is explained to Rodwell|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: hmmm if the greatest pair in the world need a written defence then the average club player in europe will still believe in miracles|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Boyd sips coffee while considering the hand and a possible defense|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiya Dan -- folks if you want notes on obscure bidding systems -- check out Dan's site|pg||
nt|roswolf: in europe the multi is standard and the non -US world knows how to defend against it|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-Sælensminde|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
pc|sK|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||

nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
pc|d6|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rmb1: It very easy to look at all the hand and say what declarer has to do :)|pg||
nt|ady: now club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: Defence have to switch and switch again|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|toral5: he will lead a @D frm hand after taking @S pitch|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|swanson: And this is now down two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta:  it is too fast :(|pg||

nt|djneill:  North made an interesting lead but always 9 tricks - would anyone else have led the spade|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell says if the QJ @C are tight then he will make more, when he shows his hand and claims|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: yes i know the USA rules about the multi but it is VERY simple to defend against it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  typical, defense has more HCP than R-M but could not bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell asking about the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been asked to give a simple defence to the multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on live stream  from left to right    Steve Robinson  - Jeff Meckstroth - Peter Boyd - Eric Rodwell|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: eventually ALL will be ACBL Hall of Famers   [some not old enough to be eligible now]|pg||
nt|djneill:  North went passive, an unbid suit but the weaker one|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Boyd sips more coffee while he considers his defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would do so but i cant take payments by credit card - if the ACBL can make a couple of bucks a sheet then i should get the same!!!|pg||
nt|djneill:  if West plays the @c9, it will be clear North led top of nothing and South can shift |pg||
nt|ahollan1: link for live stream  is   http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Boyd shifts in his seat, still considering his play|pg||
nt|djneill:  West is always going to get 4@h 1@c, 2@d or an extra @c or @s, everything is working|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs us Smith Echoes vs NT    Meckwell reverse smith -- Robinson-Boyd standard smith|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it doesn't apply here - but thought i'd mention it anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: its imps not mps but it is almost guaranteed on the fall of the cards|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
mb|4C|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
mb|5C|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: now this might be feisty|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|djneill:  brd 16 the other room went down one more, and 17 they were not pushed to 3NT so 10 imps from the two boards to nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: hand gestures on both sides on the alert of the double|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm might south pass at these colours?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth pulls out a pass card, but Robinson waves him off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it used to be easy     in the 1950s  DBL was penalty   in the 1970s DBL was negative  now  DBL may be some kind of transfer  [but not here]|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|djneill:  that could easily have been right geoff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 2N was forcing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  South's hand is too potent and 3-dimensional I think - I like 2@s general GF over the double|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell asks what card Boyd played, and Boyd lifts it up and shows him the 3 @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very possible dan|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Boyd looks at Meckwell's card.  When asked about carding, Rodwell says with 4 hearts in dummy, that Meckstroth would usually give count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 55  PASS has a lot of appeal|pg||

pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||

nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||

nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||

nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||

nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: går an å spille på ja|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||

nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
