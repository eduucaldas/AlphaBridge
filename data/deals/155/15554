nt|vugraphztb: Hampson says 3 nt is always to play in this situation|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: the club switch is necessary for knocking out the entry to @Ds after the have been esablished|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Sadek puts the screen down to ask a question.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Greco says that N has 15 high card points maximum|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm warned the @S8 is an entry but by the time @Ds are high there will be a club to cash|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: South and west are still talking and then the screen comes up|pg||
nt|cicus: Sadek has a small problem: do they have a second @H to cash|pg||
nt|cicus: he may lead a club immediately|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Sadek has called the director|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, he might have expected a stronger hand by N|pg||
nt|cicus: his defence was not entirely bad - N could have had 7303, for example|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Hampson and Greco are talking at the same time|pg||
