pc|s3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: not on a small trump lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I do not like the 2/1 in @C as the W choice|pg||
mc|8|nt|jtr: How about 1@s?:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: if you can open this E hand 2@C looks like a big bid|pg||

nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: these guys are fast players.. <i will try to keep up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: west in the oR responded 2@C and went onto 3@C which looks over optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC for EW from 2010 European Championship online at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
nt|lml: good morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi April.  Good to work with you again|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can see   2@C neither promises a 4-card major  nor  points :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in days of yore when one picked up a hand like N has one could expect to open the bidding. nowadays one is lucky to be able to open if one holds it in second seat. 4th chair? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fuhgedaboutit|pg||
nt|mamos: ndo???|pg||
nt|mamos: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas ... Roland :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello Karen|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|tlc: may i join the fun?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jim -- you want to psyche or DBL???|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: the K @s is suspect but you never know|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Is this the real auction?|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction is out of sync but I think we can see what is happening  1@h from South f 1NT from North|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT I guess coming|pg||
nt|kareno: I get it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And it's an easy 3nt.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: when I played 10-12 NT  i would try 2N as West -- but that was natural invite back then|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: seems on this auction that stansby might try 3nt w/ many more HCP than he might have|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lml: everyone is asking me about the running scores... go to www.bridgeblogging.com and click on the link|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think this will work out well for Auken though|pg||
nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: If clubs can be only 3 long, that is a quirky bid.  I don't know their system, however.|pg||
nt|mamos: so for ayone confused by the auction we think South opened 1@H North responded 1NT and South bid 2@C  Im not sure why North thought 5@C was right|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some specs are already asking for the link to the running standings.  please publish if you have it.  thanks!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: 98 is a huge score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that....however, he might transfer and bid 3N, though action is doubtful, since that would at least give him two ways to win|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: I dont know. a spade back and a club|pg||
nt|lml: ruff ruff and a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: You can go to either www.bridgeblogging.com and push the button at the top or go to www.bridgwinners.com|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..aassuming they have that agreement on this auction(probably yes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stansby understandably went low because they probably intervene aggressively against these EW methods|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lml: they both point to the same place|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: Luckily for declarer, clubs and hearts are friendly and it will fetch.  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Wonder if eas |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no surprise  Bathurst-Zagorin had a free run to get to 4@H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if my opponents wanted to play 4H with Jxxxx facing AK, i would not want to disrupt their auction either:):)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the kindest thing that could be said is that 5@C was lucky|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|bobh1: that would have worked linda but W didnt try for it|pg||
nt|kareno: Wonder if east will block the clubs and beat this.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: no it might be too hard to work out|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mamos: it seemed that North had little idea what South's shape was so East was a little unlikely to know either|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one way or another board 2 will be a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S, usually not 10 HCP & 5332|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Nystrom-Bertheau  almost all hands with 16+ HCP start with 1@C [some 16 have options]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned double from N...some would bid 2H as that is the most likely place for game. but here Martel is not willing to bid 2H then back in with douyble, so he preferes to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: show the polyvalent nature of the hand immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if any other vugraph session has seen/heard the use of 'polyvalent'|pg||
mb|d|an|ALERTED BY S|mb|p|nt|tlc: sounds very chemical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vocabulary quiz at end of set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S torn between H and NT, H will win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Martel's action was a Forcing Pass situation -- where 2@H weaker than PASS then bid|pg||
nt|kareno: That double announces a penalty pass over 1@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
nt|mamos: that 1@S overcall was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|kareno: No but if you don't get your suits into the auction, you can be run over on the partscore hands.|pg||
nt|mamos: the danger on this hand seems to be of settling in 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to guess since 1N was artificial|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, torn between raising hearts and trying for NT via 2S|pg||
nt|tlc: this time the conservative view will not pay off..|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And you've exactly identified what was about to happen.  @h Q to beat it.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has every reason to think that the black suit strengths of the defense are massed behind those of the offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin opened Stansby's hand so they had relatively free run to 4@H  again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and it is a NV game|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mcphee: here I think the 2@D call is too much from W|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos: The Cayne team have started strongly |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: South needs Kx of diamonds in the pocket and it isn't happening.  He may play diamond to the ace (expecting spade ace in west) just in case of singleton in east.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: this wont take long|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: the 1 @H response is usually less than  8 hcp|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: Whichever, he is going down for the count.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mcphee: board 2 balicki opened 1@H which ended up driving the opps to 5@C on the 4/3 fit!|pg||

nt|lml: yes something lingering with oil is the usual punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where our NS in partscore and other table game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he thinks it will be an 8 card fit. having said all that, LKosing Trick Count still says "stop thinking and bid a game already"|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a good score for Cayne in the OR  - not so easy to avoid this outcome I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: W has only 3 card support opposite a poor hand and what could be a 4 card suit|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Polish|nt|lml: 4@S down 4 deservedly lost a bunch of imps.|pg||
nt|lml: So far it seems like the Auken team is trying too hard|pg||
nt|lml: guys just sit back and bid your cards... you are good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it turns out that the first two recorded scores are played in 6|pg||
nt|mamos: Polish Club|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Weak|nt|vugraphzsv: 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: This match is between the leaders of this group.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd time in a row  their NS went down|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|kareno: 1@d negative |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: another potential gain for Zaleski here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: would you have overcalled 1@S with the north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: up to 14 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: I think I might have|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: only if they bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6d are very gd spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: not easy to avoid it, IMHO|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: Rehi all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that - I was trying to get caps lock off and got disconnected|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|panosk: even beter|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzsv: Just FYI < I can only see one side of the screen.  So bids by N & E are delayed until the board comes back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect we'll finally see same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, alerts are only from the W S discussions|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
nt|panosk: they ll stop at 6 i think lets see if he makes 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got too much to never do anything|pg||
nt|lml: After making a grand he was just worn out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: maybe coffee or drink of choice time|pg||
nt|kareno: NP Jan :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: he probably heard what you said about two pairs out of two missing it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the knockout phase (starting tomorrow), the brackets will be formed taking into account both the WBF master points and the ranking in the round robin|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oliverc: much better|pg||
nt|panosk: he cant make 7 here though|pg||
nt|lml: Suit showed five spades and four hearts nicely|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: I think this will work out okay though.  north south dont have all that much|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: intersting April -- normally operator can see all  [know all, etc]|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: North should make this.  He is going to guess spades on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: and East has no entries|pg||
nt|lml: he really can't make it without spades, he may as well go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after heart ace (if W wins it, he should lead back D 5|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: well now we have only 1 other pair bidding the grand and four missing it|pg||
nt|lml: maybe an endplay though|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|bobh1: yes sometimes passing all the time works well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: so on this line lead @CQ likely ducked,  Heart to hand club|pg||
nt|lml: but it seems a bit messy|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|lml: North is really on a roll here|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think he will do that on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: so he was hoping to endplay Versace but he did not have the communictions to do it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I can see the hands on BBO, but the screens block my view of NN &E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 4 from each group advance to KO    our match is from Group F  where current standings   1) Fleisher 187  2) Italian Stallions 181  3) Fredin 152  4) Chile 150   5th is distant ...|pg||

nt|mamos: South has a big hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|panosk: slight 1 :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be costly if N searchs for the slam|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|mamos: lol you drink faster than me  :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: there are hands where everything is right for declarer    then there is this hand|pg||
nt|tlc: it has the added advntage that 4S is likely to fail..and apparently does|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: W might pass this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mathat: 6 now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 12 on a @C lead, though|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why does it fail?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a make to me|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|bobh1: remarkable restraint by Sementa but as a passed hand he refrained from hanging partner|pg||

pc|h3|nt|lml: maybe not... he doesnt really need the ruff does he|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|tlc: 3n yes|pg||

nt|mcphee: well there are 9 tricks here with a black suit lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: a scary 9 mind you|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: head in hand looking at cards again  and then the tray|pg||
nt|mcphee: and declarer might guess wrong in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: yes, he has a choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think this is a very close decision|pg||
nt|xenya: give N @CA instead of the KJ and 6@D is cold|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: best choice, WD|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: disussion of bidding between Dehaye and lauria|pg||

nt|vugraphzsk: tommorow we start at 10:00|pg||
nt|lml: he played spades at trick two|pg||
nt|lml: or three or whatever|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: another possible swing in for croatia here.  4 spades looks biddable and like it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, next round 15:45|pg||
nt|lml: you see if you were playing this at your club everybody would have been that 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N bid quickly when Bathhurst opened Martel hand 1N|pg||
mb|2S!|an|!S and minor|nt|ahollan1: played by North not best, but still shouldn't be any problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west passed?|pg||

nt|tlc: with probable uptrick on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right again Jim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because West never got chance to bid|pg||
nt|tlc: actually on the right=meter that's only 1 of 2 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: some form of two suited opening|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d best contract for n/s but 3nt could beckon again.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: C writing explanation for B; D just said it quietly for Z|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
mb|3S!|an|!S & !D, MAX|nt|marlowepi: LTC says N does not have a raise to the 3 level, but it is hard to resist with those trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will bid Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
mb|4H!|an|cue bid|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be interesting to find out if Martel was going to invite over 1@S-P|pg||
nt|mamos: ther eshould not be a danger of overbidding here with two Black Aces missing  but you never know ..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
mb|5C|an|0 |nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes it is|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mcphee: helpful lead as it happens|pg||
nt|panosk: it seems we have a clear winner here|pg||
nt|panosk: gd performance by |pg||
nt|marlowepi: al;most surely he would bid 2S over pass, especially NV|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..and i think almost everyone would bid 3S in the actual auction...too dangerous to withhold support and values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: Zaleski team and congratulations|pg||

nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: W loved the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: count cards lead from 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally it would mean H king likely to be onside|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|lml: ace and another would have worked better as it turns out|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|lml: South is a bit worried about the heart break|pg||

mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this week i've seen most variations of Ghestem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good minor shapes for D here but stiff heart is worrisome|pg||
mb|2H!|an|P or Correct|mb|d|nt|kareno: 2@h pass or correct as before.|pg||
mb|p!|an|!hs|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: what should West do now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: this is another hadn where all participants will get their money's worth in the auction...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those variations about the same....yyour Ghestem's as good as mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I do not promise I get all the spots right every hand, but he did not play KH|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he's gone for Pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass is expected by west.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Good lead by Balicki.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: thx April...normally in that situation after a finesse one plays the card one is known to hold|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
nt|mamos: Club position is crucial to the number of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a minimum -3 for 800.  Another good pickup for Cayne.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't worked as vugraph operator you should know that the ABSOLUTE toughest part of the job is play of the hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry me too|pg||
nt|panosk: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club shift needed so club doesn't go away.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many players never let you see their cards, most just give you a glimpse|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lml: I do have the WBF convention card open now|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for an explanation|pg||
nt|tlc: mind numbing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: less clear than MUD|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 2@H is weak and 2NT is asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asking|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panosk: most probably |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually had a bid to describe exactly 5@D & 4@C  but  those @C .... yuk|pg||
nt|kareno: Normal heart play works (for the drop).|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: ty April :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he doesnt have four clubs. he has 2 low doubletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that like  @SA  @HA  @DA  @CA  is just 2-pair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N jand not enhanced by S bidding|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|panosk: possible swing in the last board, thats all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been reminded Martel-Stansby actually were on Rose Meltzer's winning team of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl|pg||

nt|lml: the opening lead set declarer up and now the trump promotion takes him down|pg||
nt|lml: that should cheer up north-south|pg||
nt|lml: staring at it will not help Versace|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Versace is thinking hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact S might bid 4S over 3S with his actual hand, so even 3S seems ambitious, especially NV. curious that N would be so ambitious here in a set where NS have heretofore shown ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consistent prudence in regard to NV games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room where Zagorin overcalled 1@S and Bathurst bid 2@S in comp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it certainly is!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question from spec:  was @D8 signal for @H?         very possible - or reverse count with 5|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff You make me 10 years older that you didnt play the 9 first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Nystrom-Bertheau have been on a World Champ team -- but they've certainly represented their country a number of times in international competition|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: do you like being in a slam missing QXXX off an ace|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: a slam is available on this one|pg||
nt|lml: Qxxx of trump|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: keycard tells you that the trump queen is not there |pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it's about 54%...plus whatever edge declarer can find by card-reading|pg||
nt|lml: apparently it was alerted as a MAX.  I am just reading the card|pg||
nt|lml: which is in teeny print even at 125%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in 3rd seat -- Martel-Stansby don't cheat on the Weak NT openers|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose chip will venture a light passed hand t/o X?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprised Lew did not open in 3rd seat at these colours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his only choice was 1N --- or 1@D then pass all responses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the latter is what i had in mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly Marshall -- i didn't think about 1@D until i started typing :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 20/20 hand|pg||

nt|kareno: That redouble could show the high honor in hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer to use it with ace or king only however.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D asks about RDBL - Z says 9-10-11 then says something about 3 @hs, but I donàt know if it was shows or denies|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: they probably are not aware of how far behind they are|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: after the 2H cue by S, the chance of driving NS a level higher are not bad, despite them being 2 passed hands|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tlc: this hand illustrates the down side to a nebulous 1D...it's hard for partner to compete when he would otherwise|pg||

nt|vugraphzsk: rewoke|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile both minors may be viable at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like if the redouble does show a high honor, then heart lead would be good with that west hand - you give up a trick but get four quickly after that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z smiling, joking with D - guess he liked the result of his club switch|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: true, but there is almost surely a three level fit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: but i think all of the hand types for 4th seat 1@D mean there is either a minor fit OR partner has BAL 15-16|pg||

nt|mamos: for me 2@C would be Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, only 56.  In our US events we start (and end) with 64 board matches.|pg||

nt|bobh1: W gambles that E has a few|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: tesla has interesting hand pattern so i believe he'll ask several relays and settle in game when he finds out nothing awesome at west's hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: thx you all know more than I do :)  not a lot of talking going on here|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If this is the route to 5@D I like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a lucky make next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if Nystrom didn't like @D - he could bid 3-card major with zero points|pg||
nt|tlc: nystrom's dbl indicates he has passed a likely 6-7 pt hand and wants to let his partner in on the secret..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has passed 1D but now shown some values, so he was willing to play diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: 56 is a long day for the WBF - Bermuda Bowl & Olympiad are 48 board days (3 16s). I think that here the later rounds (donàt know what that means though 'R8 or semi) will be 60.|pg||

nt|hedyg: Cayne has now taken the lead in his group|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is often a good holding for notrump. It's a "certain" stopper with LHO on lead if he has the ace and if his partner has it, South must still find the lead|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bobh1: if u lose the preemptive effect of the way other pairs use 2@d and things like this can also happen...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this is one of the exceptional hands with which S should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boring after his recent 5206 |pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well this is what you get for X with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what the double is about but it may help to get to the slam|pg||
nt|lml: which of course fails|pg||
nt|lml: I am still trying to understand the double.  Maybe he though he was too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a couple of other suits to consider besides spades...|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|ahri: i like how bidding is completely different from other room. minors in action here, majors there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a cheap save vs 4@H (if they find it, but 5@D is also on|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that might happen|pg||
nt|tlc: 4s here should do the trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess it isn't forcing.  Good contract.  More tea :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahri: 4@h can be set by two diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find 4H dubious. even if pd has 3 hearts, 5D could easily prove a much better game|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: I think Stanicic should have bid 3@H instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not overcall 1@H, so 3@H shows a diamond fit too|pg||
nt|ahri: and almost surely 4 cards.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzsv: B asks C if his pass denied 3 @hs and he shakes his head|pg||

nt|bobh1: i think its a make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no discussion of result -- the orginal Blue Team taught us that is good for partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2NT by N would have been stronger then 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I had a good time once trying to type something serious on a French keyboard.  Yikes!!|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahri: chance for down three and an imp for slovakia|pg||

nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S, 4@S [if Kickback],  what other options?     nope never thought about 4@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy contender for "filthy  overcall of the year" honors|pg||
nt|mamos: just lost an imp|pg||
nt|kareno: I would bid 1nt (if it is in range) with four hearts and diamonds, but not with spades.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||
nt|tlc: it has my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute treatment  ---   i was going to guess a version of Swiss with bad trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: leading unsupported aces is not a growth industry at imps|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: i meant|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z's DBL showed a 5 card Major and another suit at least 4 cards|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Stoppers in both majors and hopes for the club suit.  |pg||
nt|kareno: North needed the eight of clubs this time.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'm about to designate Z as the best player to be a VG operator for - he explains things very clearly with gestures so I can figure out what he's said :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, gestures and he isn't even Italian :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|tlc: "last train" for any specs that might wonder means "I want to make a final slam try, but have nothing specific to say without getting past game"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be quick claim too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: typically it is an artificial use of the call just below the game level|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they were kind enough to write that one down for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you are the best Operator - you bring the room to life for us as well as following the play and explanations.  I'm always happy to see you in my room :)  Thanks again!!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: he thought maybe Sementa had the stiff|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobh1: certainly is possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: The cards just won't stretch for nine tricks.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Tough hand to defend though - Z must be worried that another spade will be declarer's 9th trick, not knowing about those minor suit spots in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He can be patient about the spade.  Meanwhile, north is playing on diamonds - if clubs were solid I think he'd be going after his ninth trick in hearts.  |pg||
nt|kareno: South, that is,|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Although, if the @d6 is upside down count, either partner has those higher spots or declarer only has 3 spades (with 6 @ds)|pg||

nt|xenya: bidding challenge here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@d now|pg||
nt|mcphee: splinter in @D will get them there|pg||
nt|jtr: And West can come alive|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jtr: The slow boat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: not fond of this bidding at all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: if 3@C is a game try W should show the @H value|pg||
mc|12|nt|mcphee: so another 10 imps will be added to the Cayne score I am sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|xenya: safe bet|pg||
nt|jtr: Isnt it 16 boards?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 14|pg||
nt|jtr: oh|pg||

nt|tlc: this is an amazingly low IMP total given the number of wild and crazy hands we've seen|pg||
nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: these hands fit well|pg||
nt|kareno: Great slam missed by Belgium in the OR.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z chatting - Z says "I told you at least 5 and at least 4 - had 55" All very friendly by both of them|pg||
nt|kareno: West certainly could have bid 4@c over 3@c by east.|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Polish|nt|bobh1: would be very inspired to say the least to lead a @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the score is now 25 VP for Rayner and only 3 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this Flannery?|pg||
nt|lml: do you like the weak 2 with four cards in the other major|pg||
nt|lml: and in second chair|pg||
mb|1S!|an|NAT, 7-9 HCP|nt|ahollan1: Zagorin-Bathurst struggled with  11     they also stalled at 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Nystrom remarked.. thinks it was their first constructive auction lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = RELAY, FG  [says nothing about @C]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|Strong hand, at least 3 !ss|nt|hedyg: not when the other major is this good|pg||
nt|lml: no it was a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: pretty sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: well way too strong for a multi imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now some people dont like bidding 1NT in that position as natural but I think it is just fine myself|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT as 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: splinter for clubs thoughg 2C was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i assume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the answers to the relays :(|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4 !ss|nt|marlowepi: i am told i am wrong|pg||
nt|tlc: for partnerships that play Kickback ( a version of RKC where the key card ask is the step above the trump suit) frequently have issues when one partner has both D-H and the other ...|pg||
nt|tlc: believes 4H is Kickback in  Diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am used to it:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Just as it should be - bridge at the highest levels is still a game of gentlemen.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone know the WBF site to follow all the matches?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and ladies :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: swangames has running scores|pg||
nt|mamos: hang on I'll find addy|pg||
mb|4D|an|SPL, for spades|nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from 1@H-2@C   i think 3@D says  5-7 zz points [A3 K2 Q1] with short @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not HCP   zz points [aka AKQ points]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: he did write down 3 - 2 - 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Bertheau has 8   A[3] A[3] K[2]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok thanks.  someone will explain zz points to me at the bar later.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: story i've been told about "zz"    the author didn't know what to call the treatment so used filler of "zz" -- too many people had read draft before official name could be given, ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so zz stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Van Cleeff was one of the authors of a book called the Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|lml: apparently someone says they shows both majors 6-11.  He doesnt have that either really|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as multi.  |pg||
nt|lml: now if it show 6/4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty April!|pg||
nt|lml: yes I thought it was that... he loves multi and Mudienberg 2's which came up earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: your welcome. |pg||
nt|lml: April is the best|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose when the smoke clears they will land in the reasoanable 6Cs?|pg||
mb|4H|an|cue bid|nt|bobh1: i prefer sandwich but most good players agree with you|pg||
nt|kareno: Try http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||
nt|bobh1: when both of the opps have bid, if feel like a sitting duck bidding 1N with this hand|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, probably 6C. E will lay down club ace. then NS can both get style points for playing the jack and queen :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only thing known about West hand [without peeking] is that he is Game Force, but not @S fit with shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think this system is designed for E to need to know anything about W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: An accurate route to the excellent slam is found by B/K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z, laughing, "invitation"|pg||
nt|mamos: It's difficult to see much future in this match for the Belgians  --  really great  start for Cayne|pg||
nt|kareno: Last board of the set.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of great bridge to come.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now, Z has asked B to show him his hand, so he can claim. Then says something about smoking :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||
nt|lml: I never though of that before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 5@C encouraging|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry, I am not familiar with the system. We are doing the best we can.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice contract -- whatever the auction meant|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: I have an auction with explanations from a spec:  the explanations are wrong: 1@C polish, 1@S 7+ 4+@S, 2@D 3+@S GF 2@H 7-9(10) exactly 4@S 4@D splinter etc|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|lml: they need to take their club trick .. yep|pg||
nt|tlc: another "black box" auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: April -- the only thing to apologize for is   apologizing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably natural bidders would get there also|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I saw a match yesterday where one side was preempted out of the auction when they had 26 HCP|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mamos: ty to Jan for enhancing our enjoyment  ad to all specs for joining us|pg||
mc|12|nt|kareno: And to you Mike :)|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a great display of bridge expertise at the top level by the great Polish pair e/w|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I think there is a break before the next segment, but I don't know for sure - I wasn't supposed to be doing this, so don't have a lot of information :). The BBO Vugraph schedule ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: page should show the time for the next segment to start|pg||
