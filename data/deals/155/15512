nt|iceking: 2@D respond i would think|pg||
nt|dburn: not attractive to give a positive response in a suit with 0 hcp, but may not have an alternative|pg||
nt|othered1: Weischel was a member of the Precision team in the very early 70's that pretty much broke out the system by winning a couple of Spingold teams.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I am going to need more synonyms for impassive, emotionless, stoic, phlegmatic, so feel free to give me a hand|pg||

nt|henryb:  Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: someone will end in 3NT here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Peter :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Katz writing to explain the 2NT alert|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like a normal and fairly straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps all 64 tables will reach 3NT on these cards?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: either someone is legitimately squeezed or they throw the wrong thing anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell explaining the 4 @D alert|pg||
nt|athene: N-S obviously play a double of stayman simply says "i would have doubled 1nt"|pg||
nt|caitlin: probably puppet?|pg||
nt|athene: is 2@C a positive in diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: i will try and hunt out the NS convention card|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: a reasonable way to play, especially when people bid stayman on nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: Bocchi Ferraro? i doubt you can find that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west can see that if he passes 1nt, north is sure to double, and now NS are far better-placed |pg||
nt|athene: if you start with stayman, sometimes your opponents have trouble working out they have the whole deck themselves|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks the meaning of his bid, to confirm that it is a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: last hand it was west who had @CKQJ bare|pg||
nt|athene: it helps in the play of 3nt if you know that will be the case every hand :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not this one though  :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nhas yet to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|athene: sementa is wondering if he ought to pass his - he will wonder for a while and then bid 3nt, i would imagine|pg||
nt|caitlin: N has yet to|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting what south can have for this bid, given that he didn't pass the double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think clubs can be his best suit - he would surely pass the double then|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 21 I would GO|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they registered it with ecats for this event - but not many did so i am not overflowing with confidence|pg||
nt|athene: anyway it looks like strong club, 2@C = diamonds, rest honest-as-the-day-is-long|pg||
nt|hedyg: Anna has not yet posted the CCs of this event|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C in Bocchi - Madala system is two-way (1) GF or (2) club raise|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: when 2 passed back to south he pointed down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrt2000: surely N should at least correct to 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but Bocchi/Madala do not play a strong @c system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: sementa decides that 2nt showed his hand and hence he has to pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ala|pg||
nt|petergill: Bocchi regards himself as a system designer, so these two probably play much the same|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that of the unbid suits, bramley chooses @CJxx rather than @S8xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the Bocchi -Madala system S would not have opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps reasoning that he is more likely to find his partner with four or five decent clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n s nt 12 15|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but with a weakish hand and 5+ clubs surely south was passing the double of 2@C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mrt2000: correct|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|reisig: and with weak  4-4?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: when a person bids stayman with a very weak hand he usually has short (shortish) clubs as he is going to pass any rebid by opener, so south would know his clubs were over east's|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes strong @c and weak NT here|pg||
nt|athene: quite often when you are trying to find partner's suit, it's better to go for a minor than a major because partner would have overcalled with the major but not with the minor|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: with weak 4-4 you just bid 2@H then pass 2nt, surely|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: maybe not|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|vugraphztb: N-S play standard count, in response to a question from Katz|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz deep in thought|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|reisig: with an ace?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: this is why I prefer to plat weak NT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|d5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: east gets squeezed so no guess in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: not that declarer would have been considering finessing against west anyway|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and get the team names right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry for the inconvenience if ....|pg||
nt|ady: looks like another 3NT   n/s|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|dburn: this may be an alternative|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: If east gets his long suit in . . . |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, this is an overcall V vs NV that deserves to go for 1100 in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Ferraro had a gadget for the South hand at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: so 2@H not forcing for them |pg||
nt|dburn: so that he became declarer in 3NT with West on lead and East not having bid|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead scuppers 3NT     seems only game  that can make  is 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: double here tends to show a trap pass of 1@S, without much consideration of @H defense|pg||
nt|iceking: dbl shows trap on @S i assume|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: which was fortunate for him|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: is there not a case for south to introduce clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: can south not bid 3N?|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S stopper weak @H |pg||
nt|dburn: hard to find clubs now - Feldman could not bid them over 2@h doubled because, playing strong club, he hasn;'t yet bid his diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, Ed, but he can't make it on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dburn: he can bid clubs now, of course, but there was no case for his bidding them earlier, no|pg||
nt|othered1: That's another justification for the iffy overcall -- it can be effective to compete aggressively over an ambiguous opening|pg||
nt|iceking: S has to bid 3nt |pg||
nt|ady: ok   see the point   1@D  not natural|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he can't bypass 3NT with @hAJ|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree 3N won't make, but how can south not bid it?|pg||
nt|iceking: W overcall might look ugly, but this is the way the game is played today |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Feldman explaining the spade bid to Sadek|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: Sadak has a rather easy lead and declerar is going alot down |pg||
nt|ady: needs KX diamonds on side   not to be|pg||
nt|iceking: 6@H 1@S 1@D for the def probably|pg||
nt|ady: should only be down 2|pg||
nt|iceking: no i think Feldman will play |pg||
nt|othered1: What was the 2@H opening in CR?|pg||
nt|iceking: Sadek for @SA and @D K|pg||
nt|ady: surely will cash out for 7 tricks  once K@D is not doubleton|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont get that that @H Q looks doubleton so will try to make it i would think|pg||
nt|iceking: and end 4down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel gives a throat losenge to El Ahmady|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and passes one through the screen to Sadek|pg||
nt|dburn: trying to swap it for the ace of spades, perhaps|pg||
nt|iceking: even East @H K looks like lav for @S he could have Qx|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose possible    but once K@D does not drop  can cash 4 clubs first ending in hand and then play a spade for a miracle position?|pg||
nt|iceking: he will need entry home for his @D so cant cash all @C|pg||
nt|dburn: why would he do that? he will come to hand in clubs and clear diamonds, playing West for the ace of spades|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and end 4 down thats the normal line as i see it|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|iceking: aha didnt see this line little savety if E had stiff K|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: he might play a diamond to the ace, in case of singleton king with East I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I still don't understand alleged 2@H opening by south in CR.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: sorry - he did that while I was typing|pg||
nt|ady: on heart lead  can finesse J@D  and cash ace   and when king fails to drop can play the clubs  to end up in south hand to  play a spade|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good effort from Feldman just no luck this time|pg||
nt|dburn: alleged 2@h opening showed the minors|pg||

nt|petergill: The Open Room of this match also has the team names not matching the players who are seated|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: Bocchi likes trying out new things - i know when he played with Duboin they changed their system from time to time, not because it was getting bad results but because Bocchi got ...|pg||
nt|athene: bored and wanted to try something different|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: may do so now|pg||
nt|athene: this 2@H opener is definitely a bit different|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: will do so!|pg||

nt|gluckenval: sta inciuciando con te ? lolllll.... mica gli ho detto che sei una ragazza impegnata... forse dovevo ? :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: the teamnames are reversed on the scoreboard :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s pointed down when bid 2 h|pg||
nt|athene: but to lead a heart from Qx does mean you have to play partner for the absolute outer limits of what he can have and not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 11-15 both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S natural and forcing, I think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|vugraphztb: Yeung scratching his head, not knowing how many times he needs to rebid his 3 points|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asking for a review of the bidding before he leads|pg||
nt|athene: of course this is trivial with 2-2 trumps but declarer will be thinking about worse breaks|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v true|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you cashed two hearts and the queen didn't fall, you would be badly placed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: as you are going to lose the lead in clubs or diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: and the defender with the @HQ might cash it and leave you very short of tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so you might duck a diamond first perhaps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|athene: how would 5@C fare?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: the club switch was good for the defence - now declarer can't take advantage of 3-3 diamonds to get a club away from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: which might be a very useful play if it turned out someone had an annoying @HQxx|pg||
nt|reisig: Any bets on the result?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can possibly go down with @HQx with west|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 4|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bet -50|pg||
nt|caitlin: making|pg||
nt|athene: you think the defence have been deceptive in clubs?|pg||
nt|reisig: Yup|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer will place west with three clubs|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible the small club switch from @CQx might muddy the waters|pg||
nt|athene: if think they will find a heart lead you might prefer to try 5@C|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|athene: ok, this looks slightly worrying|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room surely it's going to go 1@D - @S and east will get a chance to bid 2@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Team names are reversed, and we are not going to change it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel tapped his fingers impatiently during Feldman's thinking, to speed up the play|pg||

mb|1C!|an|could be as short as 2|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like bidding methods account for board 3 swing|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt dbl p 2@D maybe and ew end up in 2@D could happen |pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|dburn: Bramley started that way, but decided that he didn't want his partner declarer in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I do not enter the bids until the board is pushed through the screen, so I miss passes.  Just to explain the tempo of the bidding|pg||
nt|iceking: same bidding in closed room Bramley moved 2@D to 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not that he wanted to play the hand in spades much either - he did pretty well to take seven tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i dont understand Sadeks pass at all |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ????|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: perhaps his partner'd double is defined as penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lead explained as 4th best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: after the alert on the 1 club, I saw no alerts or explanations|pg||
nt|iceking: this might work though not easy to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel looks at El Ahmady's conventioncard|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe west though an unredoubled 1N had less disaster potential than bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy to beat it either - East will have some problems discarding on diamonds and avoiding endplays|pg||
nt|iceking: give E 19hcp and doubleton @D i think i rather play in 2@D then defend vs 1nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the room is motionless|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe E should not dbl here with 18-19bal though|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ady: 2nd low club best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East goes into the tank|pg||
nt|dburn: glad to hear that the room isn't moving - the players are slow enough anyway without getting seasick|pg||
nt|iceking: is there any def |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to an expert on the E-W system, Hussein Sherif of Egypt|pg||
nt|hussein2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|iceking: Hi Hussein|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hi and how are those synonyms for impassive coming along?|pg||
nt|ady: ace king and low club would allow north an entry to play heart  and A@D  would be 2nd entry to play heart|pg||
nt|ady: AQ and low club|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer may need to cash a couple of diamonds early, just to restrict East's options|pg||
nt|iceking: if Weichsel runs 3 @D tricks east is in trouple and will probably get endplayed in the end|pg||
nt|dburn: but I can't see a seventh winner for East, while I can see enough tricks for North given enough time|pg||
nt|iceking: there is no def should make this it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: no vast matter, of course - a couple of IMPs for Bramley if it makes, but everyone will age a few months during the play|pg||
nt|hussein2: worst case from sadek point of view is -180, i would say this is the reason behind his pass.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: freeze tag game in progress and El Ahmady is "it"|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Feldman looks at his watch, some small movement|pg||
nt|iceking: yes -180 is better then 500-800 |pg||
nt|iceking: so maybe his pass was smart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With some luck they will finish this set before midnight, not sure which day, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel puts the screen down and asks about the double|pg||
nt|dburn: he really ought not to do that while East is thinking about the defence|pg||
nt|iceking: is that bad ethics David|pg||
nt|othered1: And this pace is with Feldman as dummy.  some potential for a record if he were declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: For newcomers, we know the team names are reversed on the scoreboard. Sorry about that, but I am sure you can figure out what the score is when you know. Lavazza +12|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|dburn: if someone is thinking, I would say that you should not interrupt his train of thought to ask a question that you can very well ask when it is not his turn to play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|iceking: good point never thought about it |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: the players are discussing the merits of being in each minor|pg||
nt|caitlin: d Richie:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|athene: declarer was playing west for 6-1-3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: even 1@D and 1@S from West -Pas - 2@H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: in which case with diamonds 3-3 he only needs one ruff anyway so he can cater for 3-1 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes west might bid 1 or 2@S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: mad.....new laptop frozen board|pg||
nt|petergill: William is right , with the 1@S bid at the other table being by West, North passing and east bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|athene: that's sort of unlucky - because often in that situation you are forced to play for 2-2 trumps as you need two ruffs anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S, to describe the 5-4 shape, or Dbl to describe the strong hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: 3@H appears to be Smolen|pg||
nt|dkgrab: RR never wrong   :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|reisig: Thx David :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl does seem best - can always bid 2@s over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 1nt is typically t/o of hearts but east is so strong, he thinks he can handle the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|peachy: Yes. Game force with 5 spades and 4 hearts. Had the major lengths been the other way, bids 3S|pg||
nt|01molaire: ý  believe  missclick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|01molaire: he   can    make   it|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players have requested that I not click on the bid until the board is passed under the screen and I sometimes miss passes.  Pls keep me on my toes-lol|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer likely weighing his plan|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i am still not convinced declarer played it very well|pg||
nt|athene: wouldn't west have a weak-2 opener if he had that hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: all plyer thanking each other|pg||
pc|s2|nt|reisig: For this hand ...get some ice -- have a drink :)|pg||
nt|athene: several kibitzers are suggesting that ducking the first spade might have been a better move, tactically - indeed that's what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: I predict 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: by covering the spade you force west to switch|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very interesting|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: 51S aT |pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: W thinking|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@S  at jeast]|pg||
nt|athene: west can't really be contemplating sticking the eight in can he?|pg||
nt|caitlin: at least 1@H  4@C  1@D|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly this @H5 lead has probably confused everyone :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Well ..he's tring find ANY other chance to beat this|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|01molaire: yes  |pg||
nt|peachy: how do they know, do they hear a click?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Because of a small technical problem that I can't fix - names of each teams on your score is reverse : Bramley is LAvazza and Lavazza is Bramley - sorry for this  |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: with clubs adequately protected, declarer can take almost any line,|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players were adament that they can hear the clicking, but when they fondle their bidding boxes, the cards make noise|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: still, I will honor their request not to input the bids until the board is passed through|pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence switches to @d's, East might pitch @HJ on a @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Hervé|pg||
nt|athene: np but bramley really is sitting east, right?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: he hopes for two hearts and three diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: the seating is correct, the scoreboard isnt|pg||
nt|Zmud99: yes players seat are ok|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Not clear whether to finesse or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the webcam you can see the action from the OR: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: not 4@C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: Well played by Bramley - a non trump attack by NS might have been more successful|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond attack to force the long trump hand might be a possibility|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|peachy: of course, it also avoids the chance that someone on the other side can pick up the clue as to who it was who was thinking. That would make the screen use void in avoiding UI|pg||

nt|dburn: it is - the team names are wrong|pg||
nt|hussein2: not huge damage but probably affects the table atmosphere|pg||
nt|iceking: right forgot scores are wrong sided|pg||
nt|dburn: so the score is really Lavazza 12 Bramley 2|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|iceking: yes remember that all |pg||
nt|ady: chance for n/s here|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is a chance for Bramley - game is pretty good|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@C now maybe|pg||
nt|hussein2: i dont think they will miss a game after 2@d opening|pg||
nt|iceking: not a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A bit pessimistic by Ferraro to pass 2@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like both in other room were at top of their ranges, so an easy vul game wasn't even sniffed|pg||
nt|dburn: Bocchi did not open the North hand, and his weak jump response of 2@h was passed out - no doubt Ferraro was expecting him to open with his actual hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know how weak 2@H bid n CR could have been?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Feldman deep in thought|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|dburn: but vulnerable, game is worth bidding even opposite six hearts to the ace without the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe Feldmand should be dummy here and bid 4@D not 4@C|pg||
nt|dburn: and Bocchi would certainly not have opened that|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: well even if north had J@H instead of ace there is a play for 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ferraro must have thought that it was QJxxxx and out|pg||
nt|iceking: playing Multi most play this wasy 4@C means transfer pd i will play 4@D means bid you major and play it yourself|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Feldman explaining the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: he would have a chance even facing that, as long as North had three or four diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: besides, he did not have to pass 2@h or bid game - presumably he could have made some invitational call|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel leaves the room after asking if he could get something for El Ahmady|pg||
nt|iceking: and if you look at Feldman hand he really isnt protecting anything, so imo should be dummy not declaring|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Even Feldman can play this pretty fast one would assume|pg||
nt|othered1: Was this board giving back the advantage of the minor suit 2@H opening in the CR that worked quite well for them on board 3?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: possibly, although I think Bocchi could have opened 2@d to show a weak two in a major - not sure whether they still play all of what they used to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sadek taking time and planning his defense|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: approaching the one-hour mark, and approaching the end of board five|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|iceking: with @H 2-2 11 tricks and score is even 12-12|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Will give Bramley 5 IMPs|pg||
mc|11|nt|dburn: really? adjustment for what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sadek and Feldman also leave the room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The closed room result|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sadek returns|pg||
nt|iceking: did soemthing happen in closed room on board 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They made 8 tricks, not 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so contract made, not down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel returns and says everyone has a cold|pg||
nt|iceking: so 7 imps instead of 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see what happens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they on a break??!|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume that was actually tick, not -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since he had 8 tricks and all|pg||
nt|petergill: South bid 1@C, not East|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 3nt easier than 4@S here - often the way with a 4333 facing a 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: notice that Bocchi can't open a weak-2@H because they use that for a cunning both-minors bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Bill i checked the movie again and he had 8 tricks for 2@s= last board|pg||
nt|athene: multiply the auction by the square root of -1 and try again|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C from south, not east, operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ala is this correct?|pg||
nt|athene: it's exactly 90 degrees off correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Conservative pass of the weak jump by Guido Ferraro, vul at imps. |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H "semi positive", showing the weak-2 he wanted to open first time :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Norberto Bocchi has a very good hand for his weak jump|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c is 16+|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess 1@d would be weak |pg||
nt|athene: at any other vulnerability, lacking a weak-2@H, i think people would open that north hand 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: missed 1st two tricks |pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly be a bit worried about bidding 2@H facing a strong club - you have a pretty good hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: Could well be jitters, playing on vugraph and knowing how formidable the opposing team is|pg||
nt|peachy: formidable, in the best of sense of course|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz says that the auction 1C p 1D p 1 NT he might have 4 of a major|pg||
nt|pelu: np 11 tricks for NS (or 12)|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxxxx  and out from North being enough for a fair vulnerable game at imps, South could have done more. |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@D is a good contract although 3NT also makes if played by North|pg||
nt|dburn: not Tartan, I don't think - they play strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT can go down with South as declarer|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|dburn: best for South to avoid bidding notrump, then|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H probably some maximum respond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Weichsel writing to explain the bidding sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more writing by Weichsel|pg||
nt|hussein2: 2@s would be tartan?  3@h = @d with max hand?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: would have been interesting if north had A@C instead of KJ whether they could reach 6@D|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@D sets trump and we off to Que bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes but when?|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone have the url for the video?  Lost it when my system crashed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: one sec|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@D could be keycard asking also |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  for live streaming. Cool! Credit to Mila Antonova|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: could make 6@D on a passive defence finessing J@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not, Magnús, as it took Feldman so long to count his aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sadek asks for a director, stating that a timer is needed|pg||

nt|athene: maybe south should have remembered that north couldn't open a weak-2@H and just given a little courtesy raise there|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n s talking a lot|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4 was 110 to EW, making 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's not as though bocchi is known for throwing tricks away as declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Bocchi is not impressed by his partner's Pass of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: will look at 4 in a min|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: it's amazing how bad hands with no aces look|pg||
nt|caitlin: well I personally would not say I live for one!|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C ghestem|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Ala|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: the advantages of playing ghestem this way (where your 3@C bid never has clubs) are twofold:-|pg||
nt|athene: firstly you can bid it on very strong hands with no fear you will be left there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly less will be known about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|reisig: PLUS ...partner must play the hands|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 5: South perhaps passed 2@H due to his minimum points and flat hand, instead of counting likely tricks in 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 imps on bd 3 where Q@H was led vs 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Katz asks whether the 1S bid shows 4 or 5 and \yeung responds 5|pg||
nt|reisig: except here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 imps to Lavazza ofc|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: several kibitzers are asking about ghestem vs. michaels|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N was not happy with his pass|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's a Good Thing to identify both your suits explicitly rather than just showing e.g. "hearts and a minor"£|pg||
nt|athene: it means your partner is much better-placed|pg||
nt|athene: whether that is worth giving up a natural 3@C overcall is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: there are many top pairs who feel it isn't|pg||
nt|caitlin: here yes, typically not so|pg||
nt|athene: it's all very well doubling these artificial overcalls to show "cards" or even "a penalty double of one of their suits"|pg||
nt|athene: but you have to discuss follow-ups|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: S thinking|pg||
nt|athene: in particular, is pass forcing, and what does double mean?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same as w ubusual NT but not NICHAELS|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bid 3@s over 3@c --- get it off my chest|pg||
nt|caitlin: xx is card showing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S limited opener, playing strong club system|pg||
nt|anton72: just for the records ...... who leading now..... in small table Bramley 12 ( Dark Blue color ) ....where is a player names with Dark Blue are colored Lavazza,s players ..... so ...|pg||
nt|anton72: ...Which team really lead now?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: south must have been really really nervous doubling there, since he has NO defence|pg||
nt|caitlin: E habd?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he isn't a nervous fellow though|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: a relaxing partscore, not a whole lot to think about|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control, with @D's agreed|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pelu: 3NT can make on a @H-finess - but 5@D is the place to be|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: heart now and a happy defensive crossruff ensues|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes we announced that|pg||
nt|hedyg: the teamnames are reversed , the seating is correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: and you aren't going to risk the heart finesse|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|athene: (more of a concern at MP, admittedly)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: As the Running Score in our match is recorded wrongly (perhaps all 8 players sat int he wrong seats?), it is possible that Running Scores in some other matches might also be back ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to front|pg||
nt|athene: another non-weak-2....the last one was costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C transfer, same in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: 2@HX looks like minus 800, worth missing out on. |pg||

nt|hedyg: scoreboard|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: now 2@S looks normal from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but in the other room he passed 2@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: maybe he was a bit worried north had a spade stack over him - certainly possible on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: although it isn't a penalty pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|peachy: E 2D artificial, though he happensa to also have diamonds.  It is either 4th suit, or a checkback bid, depending on system]|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @SJ lead in the other room talked declarer out of the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that was a sneaky thing to do|pg||
nt|petergill: and without the weak 2@H, North will lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is artificial showing a 6-4, with 3@C asking?|pg||
nt|petergill: if EW end in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe 2nt is any game force|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: w thinking|pg||
mb|3H|nt|peachy: 4NT invites slam, and with a six-card suit, E is happy to oblige (I would, anyway...right ot wrong)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz is pondering his response|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz sneezed, we said bless you, and now he starts his thinking over again|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung is asking about the 4 NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told 3@D has shown 6@S-4@D, which seems logical|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: In 4@S, a spade to the queen picks up Jx in South, whereas a spade to the queen does not pick up Kx in south, so low to queen is best. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a spade to the ten doesn't work against @SKx with south, yes|pg||
mb|5D|nt|peachy: favorable club lie, hearts run, and NT also right sided.  Not a really cold one, but I think I would accept|pg||
nt|petergill: West has no club stopper, so they are headed for 4@s or 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: unless you can get a trump coup going|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Katz tells Nickell that he will probably make 7|pg||
nt|athene: but for a trump coup you need lots of dummy entries which usually is hard with a 4-count|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I forgot there was no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: especially THAT four count|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|peachy: South objects to that :) :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: this is an Italian keyboard and we have not figured out how to make smiley faces, so rofl|pg||

nt|caitlin: you'd think they w9u\\|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: this is the 7th match of a round robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Even 5@D was too high|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: maybe east through that west's sequence said his 3@H was an advance cue for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east thought that|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely W would have loved to be able to pass 3@d|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: East (reasonably enough) took West's initial response to show something, not nothing|pg||
nt|athene: advance cue-bids are a nightmare - not only are they impossible to read when they come up, but they infect other auctions too|pg||
nt|athene: true, most of the fault lies with the 1NT response|pg||
pc|c9|nt|caitlin: sould be winnig!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|athene: imagine if declarer has @CKQ10|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are not a regular partnership, and perhaps East did not think that fast arrival principles apply to this auction, in which 4@D might not totally set diamonds but be scrounging ...|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: the game could easily be making|pg||
nt|athene: another point is that NS chose to bid game - they weren't pushed into it|pg||
nt|athene: as a passed hand, you can use double to show some interesting hand over 1nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: maybe 5minor 4major or something - whatever you can't show with your normal methods|pg||
nt|petergill: like 5minor and 4major, for example?|pg||

pc|d7|nt|petergill: The undertricks are not vul - if EW choose to play clubs from the top|pg||
nt|athene: with two suits wide open, declarer might just try to steal one diamond then cash his @SAKQ and give up|pg||

nt|athene: whereas elsewhere we would be a bit surprised to see double with primary support for one of partner's suits|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: Other room opened 3C so spade fit never found. Here, it was not found either because the club suit is much too pretty to not bid.  However, over 2H, North might have considered 2S|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|petergill: Any opinions on what South should do over 3@C? Pass? 3@D? 3@H, trying to reach 3NT? Close decision. |pg||
nt|petergill: North might have an opinion on this matter, at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|pelu: he has a normal opening and a passed pd  = 3@D or pass - we can all see that pass would be the winning option - but not so easy for Ferraro|pg||
nt|petergill: For 3@C, North must have a max passed hand, with long clubs, lacking 4 spades (else neg dbl of 2@H)|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, difficult bidding problem|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that they open 11 counts and even some 10 counts (but I don't know if that applies to hands with long clubs), Pass of 3@C was possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of @CQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: nice bid by Karic although it appears that he has only 15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung goes and gets water to allow Chiu to think|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: or so it seems|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the controls and three good trump support, his hand of course warrants the game call|pg||
nt|peachy: his 15 HCP are all controls and he has a probably useful doubleton, must bid 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: his hand is actually better than most 16 HCP hands|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed!|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: nice intermediates|pg||
nt|peachy: and a fistful of 10/9's that are clearly useful|pg||

nt|twcho: Zen is fighting for the KO berth|pg||
nt|twcho: and they need a good score from this match|pg||
nt|athene: the good news is, he wasn't beating it whatever he led|pg||
nt|petergill: At Trick 1, always plan @CQ play before playing from dummy - don't play fast from dummy, then pull out one card then another from your hand - that would destroy the illusion|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphztb: Now Nickell turn to think|pg||
nt|peachy: while it is slow, I'd like to tell you all who are not in Philadelphia, that the tournament is absolutely top-notch professionally organized.  Everything runs like clockwork, is ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clean, neat, and staffed with "zillions" of TDs and caddies and aides on the floor|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: ut the playing conditions are the best I have ever seen|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|peachy: Absolutely the best I have ever seen in 35 years of playing|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Ala for all those additional information|pg||
nt|petergill: Is slam easy or hard to bid?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a very good slam as last board|pg||
nt|petergill: If East can show the singleton @D, then the nice fit can be found|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphztb: I cannot see the explanation that \yeung is writing for the alert on the 2 @H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: probably Flannery|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C here if you want it enough|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: 2NT is some sort of raise - sorry we lack Convention Cards so we cannot enlighten you|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: Neither of thse partrnerships is a regular pairing - we can only look up systems from previous events for estblished partnerships|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: i would tentatively suggest 2NT isn't natural :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am glad you are here TOmmy, you know the prevalent systems in Hing Kong|pg||
nt|peachy: Hong Kong|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz leaves the room to go to the restroom|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H = short @D and 2NT is lim+ raise, we think|pg||
nt|pelu: so far only 3 pairs out of 24 has missed the slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|mc|12|nt|petergill: 7@D -100 costs too much at his vulnerability|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Ala Hamilton Day for a good job as BBO Operator|pg||
nt|petergill: -1100 I meant|pg||
nt|petergill: 14 boards per set|pg||
nt|petergill: I think there are 14 boards, then a break|pg||
