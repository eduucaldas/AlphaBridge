nt|jtr: Good evening people|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thsi is a dream table for bridge lovers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 4 players from top 10 for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 3rd seat  point count can be [much] lower|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c would seem ok too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni stil thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk10: Karen, David, Jim|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for multitasker  you can try to follow bidding/play in other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|othered1: EW are Precision-based.  NS's system is unto itself, with things like weak NT, all 1-bids forcing, and intermediate 2-bids that can have lots of playing strength|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|toral5: 3@C will be in easy make especially aftr a dbl frm west|pg||
nt|kareno: Good trump lead by west|pg||

nt|tlc: hi warren|pg||
nt|passell: this is the kind of match bridge is all about|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|kareno: For those who don't know the term, 'flower bid' means a fit showing jump.|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: yeah.thts wt i was typing to a kib:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: EW have found thenormal 3N and from the better side|pg||
pc|hK|nt|toral5: @D 8 is gud here.so 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa jiggles his leg while Greco thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: With the diamond in the pocket, it's an easy hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be jiggling his leg a lot this match I think :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asking about leads|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to David Burn|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni explaining|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco asks some more|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Fantoni took out of his pocket a paper explaining leads...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now all clear and he is thinking...Greco|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so first board will noot be flat|pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: trumps now ll restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh please don't throw me in the briar patch,, says Eric Rodwell!!|pg||
nt|jtr: I doubt if there was much the derfence could do|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tlc: very happy lie of the cards on this hand..should be no further problems|pg||
pc|c3|nt|passell: tap declarer and duck 2 hearts|pg||
nt|passell: impossible to find|pg||
nt|jtr: only in the movies|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell staring at the 3 of clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell's biggest concern is a very bad spade break.  |pg||
pc|s6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch a @D discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: players show their hands|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toral5: 10 tricks now|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|vugraphztb: hand rolling by Ginossar to give the meaning to the alert on his bid of 1 nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2008  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Israel/pachtmann-ginossar.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: bids are entered only after the board is passed through to the other side so that the tempo of bids cannot be discerned by my clicking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: BUT, I either miss passes or give too many passes, so please keep me on my toes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 1N is transfer showing @C?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|kerasidis: interesting streaming live video you can watch!|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: looks mostly like  NS   2/1 w/ "multi" 2@D  sometimes 4-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: both n and e are writing|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that would be change to the 2008 convention card :(|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on live stream from left to right   Fred Gitelman - Tor Helness - Brad Moss - Geir Helgemo|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 1 nt should show values, a decent hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@H or 3nt?|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all fantunes 1-suit openings are 1-round-force|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine north will not push to game, even though their overcalls don't have to be very sound.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking at the moment|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: can be weaker if (5/4) @H & @S  but usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|jtr: Surprised Garner didnt express and opinion about 4@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: light double...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
nt|jtr: an opinion|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yvesj49: dangerous board for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Tez|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable I'm sure they'll get to game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Fantoni did express one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni expressed a strong opinion now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|tlc: mmany would play this sequence was a mild slam try,,,|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if they have gradations of these raises.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jtr: Well, the opening was stronger here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: But even so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: action in the 2nd board...|pg||
nt|jtr: Cant see any interst here the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|jtr: Although declarer will not be so sure|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Hey:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@s seems makeable.....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: Lots of handling charges here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tez: i prefer 3@h ..looks like 2 down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tlc: this removes any ambiguity|pg||
nt|kareno: Now the diamond in case west has the ace?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|yvesj49: in france 4@c shows 5/5 at least....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Tez|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tez: 3..hi Yves|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm surprised they are still playing 56 board matches at this point in a World Championship.  In the US major KO's we start with 64.|pg||
nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play of the cards :( |pg||
nt|toral5: wt happens here on a @D return|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: I think declarer is in trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, east holds the jack ov clubs so no guess in that suit.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|toral5: final is suppose to b 96 brds?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if a trump back rather than the @h might have worked better|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, north isn't playing with open cards, as we are.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but Fulvio thought 3@c in Claudio's seat lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @s ace and @h for the jack ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, west played 5@Cx and north led trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and..back to thinking|pg||
nt|tez: all tickets to 3 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Systems of all four pairs are rather different, so it's possible we'll see few identical auctions (perhaps strong NT openings, excepted)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yvesj49: good new !|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more imps for Zimmermann here|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: claudio to play|pg||
nt|dburn: that would be a remarkable effort even for him|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or trump|pg||
nt|tez: for appercut..pd maybe has 10 of @c|pg||
nt|dburn: first it isn't his turn, second he doesn;t have a diamond|pg||
nt|tez: nunes sry|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a world class puppeteer could pull that off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: diamond jack in his hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yvesj49: i won again lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easier with screen than cards|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Hamman puts his glasses on again, but now takes them off again to think some more :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck will open south hand 1N  so will declare 4@S  -- that may mean overtrick(s)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the glasses come on again, but then they are off lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  Michael Rosenberg leads @H7|pg||

nt|kareno: Good stop n/s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|jtr: Ducking wasnt a feasible play though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been very interesting [double dummy] to duck trick 1   maybe then Brogeland gets endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, east made no try |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Easy 3nt without a diamond lead and since they are blocked, even with an unlikely diamond out |pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be Flannery-ites, judging from 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a card for them|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|toral5: @D lead as the cards lie was killing|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, 4 can make if you read it|pg||
nt|kareno: 4 makes with the lucky heart lie|pg||
nt|kareno: But better not finesse the spade.|pg||
nt|passell: playing the queen at trick 1 might induce a heart finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: spade lie, I meant|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yvesj49: i prefer 3@c in west|pg||
nt|caitlin: they may get there|pg||
nt|yvesj49: tos how 6 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance again for diamond team|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S is stronger in their methods than in standard Precision, as an omnibus 1@H response handles 8-11 point hands|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3@H show @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing explanations for Claudio|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: East may just go passive now|pg||

nt|jtr: Neither minor looks attractive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Brogeland should have played @S 6 to indicate no interest for @H. Count is not interesting here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the name field on BBO alowes 10 limit so i asked him to choose his name|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and this is his choice|pg||

nt|othered1: relative to the lead, IIRC, the Italians in general don't go out of their way to double for a lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Re the slam on board 4, Wolfson- L Cohen bid it, Meckwell did not, and Gu-Lu bid it, Pasman-Simons did not. So a 12 IMP swing in all 3 matches|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: Interesting that Meckwell, with methods not all that dissimilar to Greco-Hampson's, missed it|pg||

nt|yvesj49: reading his system ? lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio and Greco discussing the bidding on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|othered1: On board 4, Meckwell had to deal with a 11D overcall and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meantime Claudio cards on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: From a spec:  Zia would play a @d here  |pg||
nt|kareno: Could work!!|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: time for some norwegian magic|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see how|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but for a change Fantoni is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east 4@H bid from west, facing a sound raise, with good opening bid and six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: easy 4@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is a standard queen, but it varies at times|pg||
nt|sommer: sure..it was E's bid, wich was tough|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose guess both rounded suits|pg||
nt|jtr: This one is a gimme|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad there aren't any statistics for average time per hand  per player|pg||
nt|jtr: Nobody has a sad enough life to calculate it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes would be high on that list -- maybe even higher than their WBF ranking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking nunes about nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking...he learned from fantoni|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not the fastest player|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well...he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky he is not playing with Fantoni|pg||
nt|jtr: Nunes can be slow too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was he that took enarly 20 minutes to play a hand the other day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i had him 2 or 3 times on vg this week and did not seem slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in politically correct speak    they are     deliberate|pg||
nt|jtr: It all revolved around KJ9xx opposite Axx|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not slow, but he likes to think when he has a problem|pg||
nt|jtr: He eventually dropped the doubleton Q offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but cards in his hand|pg||
nt|jtr: It was Fantoni i am told|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|kareno: I think 2@c shows a good hand but I don't know the structure.|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back up now,,,|pg||
pc|d4|nt|caitlin: one example of few in favour mof bidding stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S may have been a strong relay and 3@S a maximum response, but I'm unsure about that.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A suspicious mind|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|caitlin: stats show not bidding stayan with 4-3-3-3 is far superior|pg||

nt|toral5: now duboin has the easiest of shifts...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: 10 trick now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: south could have risen with his @HA to play a diamond and get the @DK set up|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he neds to guess the @h|pg||
nt|jtr: needs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he has to loose a club and a spade... so no imps at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he can even loose some|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: then declarer has to drop the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing against sound opening bidders you could do it|pg||
nt|athene: since north would be pretty much marked with the @SQ after south produced the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but Meckwell open pretty light|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nt is 14 to 16 points by Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: still he has the same decision here, anyway, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: you can't try to endplay north as you can't strip his clubs|pg||
nt|sommer: N MUST have @DK + @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the @C7 might get set up - sorry|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and a diamond looks pretty good from here|pg||

nt|tez: he cant get risk with @c finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pbmarstr: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 was a better play maybe|pg||
nt|jtr: North would always play the 5 with 1053|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told, consistent with another source,that 3@S showed m 4-4 (or maybe 5-4?)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: if south turned up with the @DK (which he surely couldn't) then the @SQ would just have to be dropping in north's hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|athene: now north has to establish the @C7 or solve the spade dilemma|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Moment of truth is delayed|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: yes,,, Fantoni thinking now|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio opened 1c lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|jtr: I dont think so|pg||
nt|othered1: At these colors, preempt on east's hand is very aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky we have screens|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow good suit lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco told him TAKE IT BACK|pg||
nt|jtr: Some 4@s bid next door|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzta: Greco and Sementa are joking at the suggestion that Greco would duck a diamond|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 3nt here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinsonsw and Boyd both point to their bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this what he said|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s 10-15 in theory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=non-force, 10-13 HCP, 5+@S, unbal, not 4+@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Sort of pushed into it|pg||
mb|1S|an|5 plus spades|nt|toral5: passed out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no operator error|pg||
nt|kareno: Just undo :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: three passes and Sementa opened 1 @C then Greco bid 1 @S Duboin bid 2 @D and Hampson doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: after 4 passes I cannot undo <<<<<<<<<<<<<<.8|pg||
nt|toral5: lavazza played 4@S in other room:)|pg||
nt|toral5: match getting closer|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|sommer: this looks like a solid 4@S EW|pg||
nt|athene: well, EW missed the game in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: (4@H, previous board)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed through the screen so that the clicks are not heard :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Daniel Gulyas and Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|sommer: not sure 1@C is strong (only) ..is it polish-like with forced 1@D?|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: 1@d hearts i'm told, and 1nt strong (18-19)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: also, I do multiple clicks when playing the cards :)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess EW play the style where they just complete the transfer with any weak notrump|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT looks like a 18-19NT or something|pg||
nt|kareno: Lower level here will change the auction and the pressures on n/s|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tlc: the lack of paint in the tray makes this action much more comfortable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks while Boyd writes an explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Nunes playing may be faster|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h has chances|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 5 diamonds even with a trump lead|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess Rod will do something though|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H another transfer, so the strong hand gets to play it in spades|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure if 1nt denied four hearts - probably, i would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson rubs his head before going back into a reflective pose while considering his bid.|pg||
nt|athene: so west knows that this way he is sure to be dummy and have a nice rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Eric-Geoff' style|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not so sure Mike|pg||
nt|passell: yes it looks like the j of diamonds is likely to score a trick|pg||
mb|d|nt|toral5: guess undo again|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I could not undo, but I redealt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd writes an Rodwell nods|pg||
nt|gulyas: this probably shows both Ms 4-4|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I will be impressed if Nunes make this contract|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow south failed in 6@c|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 24 imp's board....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: how?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: strange|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing with screen..no penaly |pg||
nt|dburn: not especially strange|pg||
nt|dburn: they led a diamond, so he tried to cash spades but West ruffed|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he played West for three trumps rather than two|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but @h are pretty......|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky 1c opening can be a lot of things for fantunes....did not discose to much lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jack 3rd|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: disclose|pg||
nt|yvesj49: expensive board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So double sounds like it was some sort of Snapdragon|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..ya, but why prefer 3NT to 4@S from E?|pg||
nt|gulyas: with those very strong minor holdings, he decides to play it there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks a ? and Boyd quietly explains|pg||
nt|sommer: @Dlead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asking questions and Robinson talks quietly|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@Hlead from @S and @Dshift is good, but hard|pg||
nt|sommer: ..from S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks if the 2 @S bid shows 5 @S and Boyd says yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HJ looks good enough for me|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you would expect declarer to rise the ace and play spades right away|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want a diamond through him|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think that is what I heard :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds are more of a worry than hearts|pg||
nt|tlc: if you run the club 7 and guess right, arent there still chances?|pg||
nt|jtr: Entry problems to hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: probably just nine now, establishing the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd denied 4 @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzta: screen closed..nunes asking boye about carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and defense|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He has a small chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  maybe @C before 2nd @D so partner can help direct defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly - and three pesky diamonds in west.|pg||
nt|passell: I think the jack of diamonds has to score a trick here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: upside down signals|pg||
nt|passell: its hard to find a better defender than Rosenberg|pg||
nt|kareno: Or declarer for that matter - great declarers make great defenders.  |pg||
nt|jtr: Even finessing the @c9 he cant get back to hand to ruff 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Without promoting the @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asks TELL BE ABOUT THE JACK OF HEARTS|pg||
nt|kareno: Would a diamond now do damage or just expose the jack to capture?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rosenberg said HE WANTS THE UNUSUAL SHIFT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tez: if greco give 8 of @h..it will be interesting|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toral5: rusinow leads for ew i guess|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure that a diamond makes much difference|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: East is slightly endplayed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C7 is mostly Attitude|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he has a good chance of making|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Now remove trump and take the rest with help of heart finesse|pg||
nt|yvesj49: y'll be impressed lol|pg||
nt|jtr: But may be tempted to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the sytem card of the norwegians now|pg||
nt|tez: different line of play|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, it is effectively the same as he needs to ruff with a high one if he plays the 10 first|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell nods but does not play a card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more nodding|pg||
nt|yvesj49: K @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Gains 2IMPs anyway|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|passell: not with the club ruffing in|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzta: Duboin took the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: curious  the way to get a ruff is to NOT try to give partner a ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoping for 3-2@ss|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems a sensible option|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer just hoping for 3-2 spades - not much of a hope, but there wasn't much other hope|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h8|nt|gulyas: its interesting to see how these players think these thru - you cannot tell that declarer is only playing for the overtricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: now on a diamond switch he will rise|pg||
nt|athene: hearts 3-3 or the red-suit squeeze is better chance|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell sits back and thinks some more about the hand|pg||

nt|athene: a sightly odd decision to go for 3nt with a 4-4 major-suit fit; it's a lot more common with a 5-3 fit|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   upside-down Attitude  standard Count|pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: I was just trying to say: the reason why they DON'T claim 9 (or 10) tricks in 3NT - make the opps work for it, its a very long tournament|pg||
mb|1H|an|alerted|nt|pbmarstr: Another perfect result for Z|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toral5: how do u tackle this very @H suit combo in case of silent opps?|pg||
nt|tlc: 1@h=spades after the X|pg||
nt|jtr: X i guess is one minor or the majors?|pg||
nt|passell: 1heart shows spades|pg||
nt|jtr: oops silly sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: double is takeout of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I was thinking a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he didnt duck to @c..so 1 or void in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: flat board 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, he might have opened one - not sure how far he would have to upgrade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: east has a lot of points but a lot of losers, and three small hearts is very bad news|pg||
nt|athene: maybe passing 2@S isn't ridiculous|pg||
nt|kareno: One point with a bad hand and vulnerable.|pg||
nt|jtr: Not much worse than an earlier upgrade and that was what i was thinking about|pg||
nt|jtr: My brain forgot to change gear:0|pg||
nt|jtr: Must get an automatic next time|pg||
nt|warrens:   the other upgrade had a 5-card suit and was non-vul|pg||
nt|tlc: the earlier upgrade had a 5th spade|pg||
nt|dburn: still, at the other table North knew South had diamonds, so he bid diamonds (or at any rate, he transferred to diamonds)|pg||
nt|dburn: and South made a lot of tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: here, no one knew anyone had diamonds, and East will make enough tricks in 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: And 1NT should do ok this way|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Willenken thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|tlc: seems  right to win on the table and lead clubs..|pg||
nt|passell: continuos heart lead will make communication difficult for 7th trick  or a spade shift|pg||
nt|kareno: That seems the natural line of play.|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something will have to give for the defence|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, he will now - if anyone had known anyone else had diamonds, the defenders could have led diamonds and shifted to spades at some point, and that would have beaten 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil thinking....|pg||
nt|passell: yes looks like this will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have a cameraman walking with a camera in her hand around the room|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose he could play for 2@s tricks and let the defence give hima  trick in the minors|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|kareno: Not enough entries for two finesses I think - |pg||
nt|yvesj49: puppet ?|pg||
nt|tez: you can see with king of @s|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zimmerman 21-0 for the set   think how much more it could have been|pg||
nt|jtr: Likely one more here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 2@C exactly 3@H Drury  [2@D=4+ fit]|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sommer: 1@D was just transfer with @H .. http://usbf.org/docs/2006usbc/SSF/06boydrobinson.htm|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kareno: Good lead for the defense.  |pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely an option.. his pd could hardly hold a better hand for 2@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quick play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director happy|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess the moral is, whether you are insuring your jewellery or playing bridge, it helps to know how many diamonds you have|pg||
nt|jtr: But he may get squeezed doing that|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: players to the bathroom .... all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: break here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or rest room lol|pg||
nt|tez: here too.brb|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably because they are playing too fast|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 coke 2 grappa lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i will not redeal unyil players back at the table|pg||
nt|udo: riesen|pg||
nt|udo: sy, priv|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: taking close-ups from players|pg||
nt|jtr: That is what he chose|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he has played on a suit that allows the defence to shift to... you've guessed it, diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes and take 2@ss 2@cs 3@ds|pg||
nt|kareno: So he's going for two spades, four hearts and a minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|tlc: but now a @D will beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell put the cards on the table now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|gulyas: I agree, passing is certainly a possibilty|pg||
nt|jtr: He did well not to play a @c|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if his partner had clubs he could have led them|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: if hes forced to ruff 2@S,def has 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: i think i should betr slep.i m seeing @H as 4-0|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck could easily have them  But maybe then he would have led one|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|kareno: That defense should be clear to Greco after this spade play.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Fantoni @H8 then @H4 asking for @S?|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: I beat you in sentence length if not speed|pg||
nt|passell: diamond pouring it on in other match|pg||
nt|tlc: a ping pong match this hand has become..|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|toral5: now fate of the contract only on @H guess|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels.  North should wonder why east did not continue spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa just plays with his tricks that lie before him|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: Pinged again|pg||
nt|tlc: yup :)|pg||
nt|tlc: a spade instead of club wouldve found him home|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: but as it is, 4-1 trumps and a couple of finesses offside make this go down|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: Final pong maybe|pg||
nt|passell: looks like declarer might have gone after clubs early|pg||
nt|kareno: This is known as a contest between the declarer and the defense.|pg||
nt|tlc: this is why 1NT hands are so much fun to watch...|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like the declarer is going to win - and go down.|pg||

nt|sommer: getting rid of @HJ helps:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tlc: a heart lead appears to be the winning lead on this layout|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: north really ducked there?|pg||
nt|gulyas: in precision, you bid this very fast: 1@C-1@D-1@S-1NT-2@H-4@H I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell did duck the J @H!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he keeps the @HJ to overruff in spades, potentially|pg||
pc|s4|nt|toral5: i am also bidding 4@S.pd cd easily ve 6@S|pg||
nt|kareno: And there goes the club trick.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yvesj49: have to find  Q @c|pg||

nt|tlc: as David already pointed out :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sommer: E has a good hand for Gazzilli! ..2@C is EITHER natural or 17(16)+ . That MIGHT have taken EW to game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: Then the 9 might look as being suit preference for @hs|pg||
nt|pietraccio: , |pg||
pc|h2|nt|toral5: this is making now|pg||
nt|kareno: AND the diamond trick.|pg||
nt|toral5: to late for the shift:(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with 2@d overcall and 4 @s in east....|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: A two trick compression by the defense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is yelling at Duboin|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i don't see anyone getting to game without the help of powerful hallucinogens|pg||
nt|bessi2: not so sure about that.. west would bid 2@s over 2@c showing a bad hand and east then has no bid I would think|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|yvesj49: not a perfect count but |pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Sementa still seems angry|pg||
nt|gulyas: also, if you are non-vul, you are not pushing games as hard - vul games are worth a lot!|pg||
nt|sommer: game was not %-well, tho|pg||
nt|sommer: but good to bid, when it makes;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: discussing the hand all 4 of them now|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: director said ...58 minutes to play|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: sae contract in closed|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|jtr: Hmm 3NT looks beatable|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C artificial game force|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin played sementa for aj @S.so tried a @S ruff effect.but tht dint sound gud cos sementa cd easily have 6@S|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, E would have a "little" 3@H:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, both the last game (4@S bd7) and this (bd 8) were so-so games, but since the first one was in vul, they went for it|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|jtr: Even on a @s lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S=6+ @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: its simple - say the other table misses the game: if non-vul, you are +6 if you make, -6(-5) if you don'T|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd rubs his chin while he thinks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you are vul, you lose 6 if it didn't make, but gain 10-11 if it does|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So far the Zimmermann team has played a perfect session and there has been nearly no possibilities to gain IMPs for Strul.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: enough to rread another bulletin lol|pg||
nt|jtr: It looks like East may need to unblock the @s double dummy|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|kareno: 3nt is a winner here.|pg||
nt|toral5: especially aftr knowing tht sementa has a low hcp overcal|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that the other room is playing the same board.|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah no entry short|pg||
nt|kareno: Need spade onside for any game |pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|jtr: @hA led next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: only makeable contract is 3nt here|pg||
nt|toral5: wel done|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin says his pd is 3 5 3 2 shape|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, if West has Kxx it wont help anyway as he has an entry for @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: In NT that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Sometimes hands are just tough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: no endplay ... no make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way to make this - you can ruff the @HK down but you don't have the entry to cash the @HQ|pg||
nt|sommer: Boyd was tempted by his 4-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 @D usually promises 2 @D|pg||
nt|bessi2: only way to let this through is if meck ducks the Q of clubs but I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|athene: E-W in the other room given a much easier ride; east could show extras and stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: with both @CA and @HK wrongly placed for declarer, he is likely to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a review of the bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: had had placed the 4 @C bid near the table, withdrew it, and then placed it there again :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a rather nasty play problem though.. he might even finesse the hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, but still 1 down|pg||
nt|bessi2: either that or cross to the ace of hearts to play a club.. playing Rodewell for axx in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a further explanation of the 1 @S bid made by Rodwell, which denied 5 spades|pg||
nt|sommer: he may go for @CAxx in N too|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but still -1 at least|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think he will finesse hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: -1 most likely, either losing the 4th @C or the @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd makes no move to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: keeps shifting in his chair :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks another question of the bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: last brd proved to be very costly.|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to run into a trump promotion with 2-2 trumps but he certainly can't afford to cash a second top trump if they are 3-1 and then be denied a club ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sommer: agree with @Hfinesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: signals in trump suit are asked with 2 possible answers given|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: N/S at the other table have had a fairly horrid time|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|athene: the 1@H bid might itself be light but you would not expect south to bid 2@S on a known 3-card suit with no values|pg||
nt|athene: so you know he has something|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just hoped it was the @HK, reasonably enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: orry folks, techinical difficulties|pg||
nt|gulyas: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc back|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: yep...you said it exactly like Hampson expalined to Claudio|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i was in 'Estoril' 2005 and was soon eliminated (bad luck for sure...) and watching fantoni nunes at vugraph was a great pleasure|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoping for 3-3@cs 4-3@ds and the @s finesse|pg||
nt|tlc: eemed better to duck the 1st @C, so maintain communications, that play the AK first|pg||

nt|jtr: He had certain npositions in @cs though|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|jtr: This would not make at the local club|pg||

nt|toral5: fit leader 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is probably down, but 4@S could be close|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just have to get their club set up here before it vanishes on a diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@S|pg||

nt|kareno: Could be down one from this point, though.|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie,trump lead and @C ace was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco puts his cards down and holds his head between his hands|pg||
nt|toral5: and than @D.tht wd ve been 800 i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is fidgeting and his leg jiggles|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr this lead greco will escape for a smal loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco makes no move to play a card|pg||
nt|kareno: Greco a slooooooow player|pg||
nt|toral5: can greco manage 3 @D ruffs?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Dismond has picked up 27 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: "Sorry" from Greco|pg||
nt|sommer: good 4@S and sac|pg||
nt|athene: north with five spades and the void in hearts doesn't want to double and double, because that will lead to partner passing too often|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@s might have been a close affair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks Robinsons if his bid shows a minimum and Robinson concurs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-18 HCP, not 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: action heroes ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: well, is down with best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: these guys love to lead from Jxx|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|toral5: ?????|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for holding up the play|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps not quite right|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe not so right :(|pg||

nt|othered1: it was right not to play 4@HX . . .|pg||
nt|tez: with acelees hand 4 nt..i dont agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agree with yu tez|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c for sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: of course, no-one is going to play in a mere 5-4 club fit with a splendid 5-3 spade fit available|pg||
nt|tez: np other leads|pg||
nt|dburn: why would anyone lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco choosing not to lead one of his bullets|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: Boyd will see a small hope, when @DJ falls, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tez: we belive they will not ruff to @c ace|pg||
nt|othered1: with partner's double of 4@S, how could east lose an ace?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't believe they will either, but if partner has the king of spades and the ace of hearts is not cashing, it might be a good idea to establish spades for our side and not clubs ...|pg||
nt|dburn: for their side|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rosenberg thinking|pg||
nt|tlc: interesting if he takes the wrong major suit finesses and eric exits a low club..|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @H to the jack now?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: certainly hard to find:)|pg||
nt|jtr: But they can get the @cs going|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: some spec says 4NT shows even number of controls|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzta: Boyd is emotionless upon receiving the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4-0 hearts isn't so bad - it means 4@S might be making|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he is not doubled:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd leans his chen on his left hand and thinks further|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: or rather his chin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland led right suit -- just [in this case]  wrong card|pg||
nt|jtr: And declarer may not read the @d situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 was ostensibly 4th best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in his hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and......back on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He probably know Boye has the @H king after some thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i should go get a coffee|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|tlc: anyone|pg||
nt|passell: low club no good he would win 6|pg||
nt|warrens:  a low club should do it|pg||
nt|passell: rusinow  asks attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: No idea of the jack lead.|pg||
nt|passell: yes low club|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, he would get 2 @s, 3 1H's, 2@D's and 2@C's, but he has to decide whether to finesse in diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  3 @h's|pg||
nt|tlc: he could,,but he may believe the D hook on|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he could maybe exit another @c and see what happens|pg||
nt|passell: dicking the opening lead woulda made this easier|pg||
nt|passell: ducking  sorry bad computer skills|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Mike|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: but did he play @C q?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Now two rounds of hearts after club ace inflicts some damage.  But must play a diamond after that.|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 800 now|pg||
nt|toral5: same position wt v discussed on an initial trump lead by duboin|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes, Greco played a small spade and trumped it and then lead the @C queen!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meck thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: This should have speeded things up.....|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: More thinking for Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 now - cant take all trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think the way to beat 4@s is repeated heart plays be the defence.. pls correct me if I am mistaken|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Does not help to hold back the @D Q if Boye has 4 diamonds then|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Okay down two.  He can claim now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards are shown|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|toral5: no.3 down|pg||
nt|toral5: 2 down i mean|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|gulyas: repeated trump plays work, too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: Oh dear|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Might have the @D king of course|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see why he did that|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nunes should probably have blocked the diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: And neither will he be able to soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye asked YOU CAN NOT HAVE 4 spades isnt it|pg||
nt|jtr: Blocking @ds doesnt help  The defence just establish a @c|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Fatal spade return|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: Here we are, both of us|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Okay, I'll make a cup for you with my nice new Keurig machine :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckwell writing furiously to each of their screen mates|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S natural but only 4+ and might be canapé; forcing one round|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT is 0-4 points or so, without 4 spades|pg||

nt|caitlin: Hamman went down in 5@D here...lost 10 |pg||
nt|toral5: oh|pg||
nt|toral5: nickell stil trailing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin taking his time to get this correct|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s an okay contract too here.|pg||
nt|toral5: infact 6 is ok if no @C lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|caitlin: a spec saying 6@S on non @C lead...no tea or coffee yet and my coffee is always decaf:)|pg||
nt|athene: if rodwell now bid 2@C east would surely emerge with a double|pg||
nt|kareno: Should make.  The defense can't get at spades before declarer can knock out the heart ace.\|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks about leads and is told A from AK|pg||
nt|athene: usually when you pass a strong hand over a strong club it's with the idea of coming in later, unless it looks like a real misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: one in each suit and 500|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|gulyas: if E flashes all his goods in the red suits, declarer will probably misguess @Cs|pg||
nt|bessi2: 8-9 tricks depending on the @c guess|pg||
nt|athene: east was a little bit passive here, especially at love-all, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but for all he knows south could have length in both red suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth leaves with the director for the restroom|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Due to a defensive error|pg||
nt|jtr: either 8 or 10 tricks i think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|kareno: Bath coup trick one.|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he continues|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs, that is a duck hoping west continues into the tenace.|pg||
nt|kareno: The ten by east obviously denying the jack of hearts so west will shift.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson fingers different cards, but not a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC players rarely continue with signal from pd guiding them. Do you agree Karen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC-world class|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen, what can I say?|pg||
nt|caitlin: she is having her tea:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bidding and play to the first few tricks is glacially slow, and then unbelievably fast, like an avalanche|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: agree or not!!|pg||
nt|sommer: 2-3 imps pick-up are welcome for NS|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: also Meckstroth-Rodwell have been known to use the strong club as a pre-emptive weapon, opening it light and talking opps out of good contracts|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|jtr: Not an error; a wrong view:)|pg||

nt|bessi2: yes.. east was in a very tough spot|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has a strong hand, but bad distribution to reopen|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell ys absent mindedly with his mustache while trying to decide the best line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: playing with his mustache is what I meant to say :)|pg||

nt|kareno: I heard that Rodwell is still playing so he's innocent :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||

nt|jtr: Next a low @s maybe?|pg||
nt|jtr: After @dA|pg||
nt|jkotor: Q@s ! @s|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Then the spades will be blocked|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he has to establish tricks somewhere|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment counting how many tricks he has|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe playing North for Ax@c is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and he said Incredible board|pg||
nt|jtr: Then he can be endplayed even if he wins @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: closed the screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ours is actually one of the closest matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: and slowest!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking questions |pg||
nt|jkotor: cause all Polish lost yesterday :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes looks realy distressed now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N has to play @C Q, and S has to play low to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jtr: He should see us!|pg||

nt|jtr: Yep So are we|pg||

nt|athene: now a club through, trying to get west off some endplay|pg||
nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will lead the @SJ from dummy next time he plays the suit, holding his losers to two|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||
nt|athene: sorry out of his spade spots|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: restart time for final set is scheduled for 30 minutes|pg||

nt|drewsky: What of declarer cashes 2 clubs....what does north pitch ?|pg||
nt|passell: another heart is ok too ducked|pg||
nt|kareno: Someone asking if a spade from dummy would draw the king from north.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry|pg||
nt|passell: can only cash 1|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer hasn't got two clubs to cash ??|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: now @HQ to king and ace, and @SJ, maybe|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|caitlin: this is painful to watch|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: well, he did say it was a test - maybe he failed|pg||
nt|kareno: ROFL David|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: no cards were played while we were offline :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahhh:)|pg||
nt|athene: if he views to drop the @H10 offside he can even unblock his @H8 and finesse the six :) as a kibitzer points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still has not played a card :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can you remake the score, Ala?|pg||
nt|bessi2: the 10 of hearts doesnt need to drop.. west will be endplayed in spades.. he knows he has the king|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure his nice intra-finesse play actually got him anything because if he gets forced in diamonds it doesn't matter whether he ruffs with a small spade or a boss spade|pg||

nt|toral5: 12 imps at stake here only on the opening lead|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bessi2: many play this sequence as showing a better hand.. raising to 2@s immediately with that hand.. but they clearly dont play it that way|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|pbmarstr: This time off two aces of course|pg||
nt|caitlin: disagree!!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|athene: 14 and 15 - well, they aren't a power of anything|pg||
nt|sommer: 15 it is ..60|pg||
nt|gulyas: it has something to do with WBF policy, how many bds a player can be forced to play on a given day|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|yvesj49: the end|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the match now|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H last train slam try?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: all my money|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i go to the bank for the 2nd round|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx for watching back shortly|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it was a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set...sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: great to watch|pg||
nt|passell: finally a good hand for Bobby Wolff he refuses to play key card|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe Traian could ask them just to play on?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i need a break... forget about them|pg||
nt|jtr: I bet|pg||
nt|passell: same auction at the other table except hamman bid 3nt instead of passing 2spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: fast play i guess|pg||
nt|tez: enjoyed a lot:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they did not bother playing it lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: back very shortly! ty Traian,our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: bye all|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
nt|tlc: so,, more IMPs to nickell,, they took the low road here and landed in 2@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jtr: An Irish slam for those that ask, is where the opponents take their 2 trump tricks and then wait for their Ace(s)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: No the slam has excellent chances. All you have to do is lead Q of @D from hand and S to take the Ace|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine this was an invitational sequence.  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jtr: East hand looks pretty good to decline it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tlc: a lot of tens and nines to go quietly with east's hand|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|nt|kerasidis: invitational with 5 spades!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: seem as if S leads the natural small @d then 3NT is unbeatable|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|vugraphztb: Zia says we need a better method and good luck to Hamman|pg||
