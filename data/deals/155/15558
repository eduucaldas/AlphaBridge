nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
nt|tokay1975: just 1550|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussions between the norvegians|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: nice bidding |pg||
nt|caitlin: This should be a very interesting match: Greco/Hampson are very good and aggressive.....Duboin and Sementa are very experienced international players|pg||
nt|caitlin: and very successful|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
nt|stc: very good judgement in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|tez: hi sgurbjorn:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|caitlin: I suspect it is Duboin who is thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
nt|caitlin: wrong!|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh OK|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Joe our operator:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N EW looks a reasonable effort vulnerable -- whether it will be made is another question|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if he  made   5cl  they win 12  instead of losing 14|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 11 tricks in NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: just like we were discussing earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew not used to having ONLY ONE long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Had to join you, you looked lonely:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ellen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tokay1975: tyyy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: play for 3N facing many modest smatterings|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: this was a real football game.  We started with Cayne running away with it and Auken shaky|pg||
nt|tez: @s  lead 12|pg||
nt|stc: a sqz @s/@d could bring number 12|pg||
nt|tez: i guess @d lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6 sure tricks is what they start with|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil confidently reached 6@C|pg||
nt|tlc: on 14?|pg||
nt|andersk: the first board was not good for BRAMLEY, had a huge upertunety, and missed it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- yes 14 was bid to 6@C  after natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tokay1975: his judgement  was  very good i thk to bid  5cl |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Anders|pg||
nt|tokay1975: note that  giorgio  duboin bid  4nt  and they were ,in 5h impossible to make|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: this is the last board for now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tokay1975: i prefer also  4nt but i am not sure which one is  better |pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobh1: the movie says that 6@d made in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: then Auken got a few good results and the momentum shifted.|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you April, great job @H|pg||
nt|stc: the communications are not very good for the sqz |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: North thinking|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Linda :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Sepan|pg||
nt|toral5: sapan.hi caitlin|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|toral5: brb|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hampson will suspect the singleton heart from the auction -- no NT opening|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: need finesse @c |pg||
pc|d3|nt|andersk: I like the 4 NT bid too. But Im more conserned about the line of play from this room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now jack of hearts maybe? |pg||
nt|andersk: small @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened an Acol type 3N|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  if he can make  4cl tricks he is safe  thats why i thought he will play jack of hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stc: @c, AKQ@h, @s finess, it works|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if the score is correct in the CR on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: they fixed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set scheduled to begin in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bobh1: they just changed it to -2|pg||
nt|lml: 6@d was down|pg||
nt|lml: a big blitz|pg||
nt|lml: congratulations to the Rayner team and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|lml: I hope I can be watching both in the finals!|pg||
nt|bobh1: thx all c u later|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: see you later. thank you all!|pg||
nt|lml: thanks to the operator who was outstanding|pg||

nt|lml: bye now|pg||

nt|Walddk1: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores |pg||
nt|andersk: S has to continiue @C now otherwise the @S can be good or @D trick|pg||
nt|andersk: or 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andersk: tempting to use the Queen, but actually no need|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|nt|tlc: thx all for letting me join the party..a wild bunch of hands!|pg||
nt|andersk: 3x@h now and @C A @C to 10 @S will endplay North|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 75 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's over now|pg||
nt|bessi2: but will he take the spade finesse |pg||

nt|lml: Thanks Hedy it was fun and thanks Kitty and April the wonderufl operator|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks specs for joining, we hope you enjoy the show|pg||

nt|lml: bye|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  small @h to board|pg||
nt|andersk: risky, since North might have Qxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for tomorrow's schedule with your local times   http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||

mc|8|nt|andersk: Northe have 5 @S 4@D and 1 @C|pg||

nt|lml: he|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: and good morning|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|stc: Our two teams are 3rd and 4th separated by 1 VP|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up for Lavazza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South has quite a hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzsv: and an opening |pg||
nt|xenya: after the 1@S overcall by S 3N had very little chance|pg||
mb|r|an|hearts|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was different some decades ago|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it was a bad lead though|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting use of rdbl|pg||
mb|d|an|support - 3 hearts|mb|2H|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting to open S hand 2N|pg||
nt|tez: unlucky 6@d|pg||
nt|toral5: back|pg||
nt|xenya: probably support double from N|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes alerted as such|pg||
nt|toral5: heading towards an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya:  aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: by NS|pg||
nt|caitlin: so 2@H raise of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: transfers after the D, so RD = hearts, 1@H = spades|pg||
mb|p!|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Normally a game bid and won at both tables, with players with theese skills|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
nt|toral5: seems supp x is mandatory in thr methods.opened with less than 11 and now a supp x|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: very tricky, splits not friendly for NS but good finesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
nt|tokay1975: is morgan thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ok its free  :)))|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to his partner:)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: his pd  has 4 aces with 19  count and still his hand  cannot mnake 5|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even 4 is  problem that  cl ace in onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
nt|tez: makebl 6@d with open cards..but...|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see any scenario where finessing in spades is the right play|pg||
nt|stc: but to make 6@d you need all finesses !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will just count on diamonds 3-2.. ruffing one spade and discarding one, intending to give up the K of spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
nt|toral5: an expected push|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stc: sure, this is the normal line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the board came very quickly back to South...lol|pg||
nt|tez: pelle bid good IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now some more thinking|pg||
nt|tez: 5@D= i have nothing|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure what south is considering.. grand out of the question at this point and passing 5d is unthinkable|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe not unthinkable.. his pd could have kqjxxx kqxx in hearts and clubs i suppose|pg||
nt|tez: we are sure camberos will try 7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||
nt|lml: Solani is sort of endplayed but he can get out a spade|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if a strip and endplay is the best line|pg||
nt|tez: nice bid|pg||
nt|stc: on non trump lead the @s finesse looks ok, why not|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps a 4@c bid from camberos would have been a better bid instead of 4@d.. gives his pd a chance to bid 4@d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: on this lead some chances|pg||
nt|stc: but you have to choose the right side|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead auto|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|tez: he cant lead singleton trump in this squence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|lml: bathurst is going down with the diamond offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry these guys are fast. |pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D seems a good result here|pg||
nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: If @H is 2-2 it will be ok to play @S after 2 rounds of @H  The problem is: What to do with the 100% @D switch, wont help to run it, so only 1 line left: @C A onside|pg||
pc|h3|mc|10|nt|lml: he played for both red cards onside|pg||
pg||

pc|h8|nt|peachy: the rule of "never double 4m at IMPs" is out the window in in this hand, for reason|pg||
nt|henryb:  This will probably end up two down|pg||

nt|henryb:  losing three clubs a heart and a diamond later|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Platnik might have done still better pitching his heart on the third spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: he did ruff a ht in his hand |pg||
pc|d8|pc|hQ|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|gulyas: this is a RR match in the Rosenblum Cup (open world champs)|pg||
nt|lml: good morning from Canada|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|lml: I am quite happy to walk in and see Canada is leading|pg||
nt|andyv:  did I miss something?|pg||
nt|andersk: Can East have 5332 with @C A and pass opening hand, and W not bid with AQJxxx in @C?  I doubt it, so E need to have a @C honor, then surely a low honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: sorry specs we do appear to have tech problems here|pg||
nt|mamos: we are tryong to find out what is happening onsite   sorry for delay all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Herve is on his way to this match folks, he'll get it fixed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: herve's speaking  I will catch up bidding and play here|pg||
nt|mamos: and from England|pg||
nt|gulyas: also from Hungary|pg||
nt|mamos: yes this is Group F  (of 16)|pg||
nt|blum1956: weak NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
nt|bt: not a classic 2bid but effective here|pg||
mb|1N|an|semi forcing|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: decent 3N here for n-s but unmakeable with the club ace in the east hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: boring hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4d is one heck of a bid in that spot in my opinion|pg||
nt|tez: q of @h|pg||
nt|xenya: this might have issues...|pg||
nt|xenya: but makes perhaps if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin will start with his natural @H q|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
nt|bt: its a little aggressive imho|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I like the dbl either.. prefer 2N even with those lousy heart spots|pg||
nt|bt: 2n is a slight underbid, so i understand the double|pg||
nt|bessi2: but with only +50 or 100 defending 3h on the menu.. -100 in 5d surely nothing to be concerned about|pg||
nt|bt: this is heading for one down unless west gets stuck with the @C J in some variations|pg||
nt|bt: @S A, @HA @H ruff, diamond, @H ruff diamond, @S, @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n asking question of e|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
nt|bt: then on @C to king west can unblock|pg||
nt|tez: ty:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
nt|toral5: @D q10 falling are also gud news for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes -- i missed that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like a comfortable make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco asks about count signals|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|stc: 17 a push after identical play in both rooms|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Pellegrini in the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness|pg||
nt|bessi2: a diamond now and a heart back might bother declarer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stc: @s looks best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
nt|andersk: When you take out 1 NT X, you have already shown 6@S and a weak opening, why do partner bid 3 @D if not force?  I|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tez: if helgemo give @s J ..|pg||
nt|tez: GAVE|pg||
nt|toral5: ruff @H and 2 high trumps;so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toral5: his worry should be an @H over ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||
nt|tez: he belived @s's are 3/3 now|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looked that way|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh disaster for lavazza in the other room|pg||
nt|toral5: so losing 12 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he had out the @H9 then switched to the @C3|pg||
nt|caitlin: to see other room www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|stc: yes|pg||
nt|stc: here @h was better, puting some pressure on dec|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: I think you are seeded if you are a bit good|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|toral5: match will be tied now|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @H 9 guranteed 8 tricks, so he decided to increase his chances in case @CA is with W |pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco apologized for taking solong|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|blum1956: Pepsi should be Jacek Pszczola, the World Champion|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bessi2: but the legitimate way to make the contract is for declarer to play west for ax in clubs|pg||
nt|bt: north forgot to unblock @D9, beer card not important in china?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: ok  safely done|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to allow for 4-1 break in both black suits|pg||
nt|lml: the rules are probably somewhere on the wbf site or maybe easier to find on ecatsbridge.com|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bessi2: anyways.. 99.9% certain Lev will unblock club Jack if it comes to that|pg||
nt|bt: now north knows 55 in east|pg||
nt|bt: if theyre in rd of 32 they know|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer tries to go for the misdefense here then he doesn't know Lev well I should think|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cJ|nt|gulyas: a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|lml: no double squeeze|pg||
nt|vicky888:  no communication|pg||
nt|lml: south cant be squeeed |pg||
nt|lml: he has no winners|pg||
nt|toral5: @H ruff is the 8th trick.cos if @H over ruff he doesnt ve the entry to enjoy @C king,EVEN if ace is right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: needed to cash the @CK for that, and that kills the communication|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bt: if u want them to forget to unblock u should play faster|pg||
mc|8|nt|toral5: nice scores to watch:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|henryb:  just get the puppies off the table|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: that is correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how many teams pass to the next round?|pg||
nt|lml: This is group J|pg||
nt|lml: 4 in each group|pg||
nt|mamos: Im still stuggling to nderstand North's mistake on the previous board  any ideas  why he went wrong?|pg||
nt|andersk: Andy..pls|pg||
nt|bt: true|pg||
nt|toral5: we do have a super match|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: =64|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: as I said at the beginning|pg||
nt|toral5: i missed tht:)|pg||
mb|3S|an|forcing|nt|Vugraphzsv: 1 s shows 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||
nt|andersk: would you rather bid 2 @D than penalty double 1 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh.another 500 in the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gulyas: not very exciting in a team match, I have to admit|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a disappointment for North   |pg||
nt|bt: so north played to respect the opps as opposed to the more likely lie and a misplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||
nt|andersk: Im told: EW play xfers at this point to show a weak hand or 12+...rdbl is always limited to 10-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: though at least he wont be too high which might have happened|pg||
nt|tokay1975:   walid knows for sure  this is forcing he just took the risk with weak hand  .both opp showed some values|pg||
nt|tez: seems 5 card @s..bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against 620 i guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: its clear he thought @h6 was singleton but this was misguided|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will be an easy +620 for Lev|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greco/Hampson great pair and aggressive but Duboin and Sementa have far more international experience|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: this hand will play quite well for north|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d wenz down in OR on the same @h lead !|pg||
nt|xenya: as Ellin said, NS are very aggressive bidders|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vicky888:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c checkback, but I believe not GF|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps for @D team|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: S seem to upgrade his hand|pg||
nt|andersk: next time 3 NT is cold:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: 6@h making but not a sort of perfect contract|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s does make on the previous board of course|pg||
nt|stc: @s now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petepunt: playing small @H on board 18 seemes strange|pg||
nt|lml: apparently crazy things are happening in the OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx, however, doesn't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, rather, shouldn't|pg||
nt|lml: the OR is in 7@C in the other room but they aren't finished yet|pg||
nt|lml: they are all on steroids|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: www.bridgeblogging.com has the scores. |pg||
nt|bessi2: club ace.. cash 2 spade tricks and revert back to clubs only way to bother declarer it seems|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  this contract appears to be super safe...CR in 3@s making|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: i am a big fan of preempting in spades, but i am not sure if it is correct on this eau de cologine hand|pg||
nt|tez: do you overcall with helgemo's hand?|pg||
nt|stc: what about a 3rd @s round ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: or a 3rd spade even|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: I would prefeer to trust my partner instead of my opponents|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tokay1975:   this is true he just took the risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I think that EW have played a few times and pretty much know their system:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: they have doubled 7@C in the OR so we should have a pickup for Canada|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, i retract -- W didn't double 6@D -- he bid 7@C instead|pg||
nt|bt: cologne|pg||
nt|caitlin: no X is big plus for Diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tokay1975: they have been playing together for years|pg||
nt|toral5: we have a new leader now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, N is on the wrong wavelength|pg||
nt|bessi2: but now it will make comfortably|pg||
nt|stc: small defense error(@c before 2nd @s)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos thinking|pg||
nt|tez: bi-color hands are very valuable after finding a fit|pg||
nt|stc: here the fit is "moderate"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still thinking|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: I know East-West and they are pretty sensible |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt certainly helped their cause here -- in a sense|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tez: in this sequence, there is no fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bt: and now i wait for the questions? lol|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: we shouldnt see too much mischief from them|pg||
nt|mamos: on Bd 17 the most interesting answer refers to North not having any clear alternative action|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: well, 7@cx is a bit on the naughty side |pg||
nt|toral5: turning out to be a first few gr8 brds for @D|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: not the percentage trump handling here|pg||
nt|andersk: Im getting mixed comments from specs regarding auction on the previous hand, however IMO 3 @D looks forceing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they won cavendish  i thk 2times and lots of success in usa nationals|pg||
nt|andersk: I beleve East too a gut shot by passing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and also best pair of  egypt they are very experienced players|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|7|nt|petepunt: again protecting v 4-1 breaks may cost an imp or 2|pg||
nt|xenya: same 3 down but an 8-imp gain|pg||

nt|lml: so Canada starts off with a nice lead|pg||
nt|lml: and if you think I am impartial just look at my flag|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  we saw what happened in the last round...  |pg||
nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||
nt|andersk: Reda is telling me RD is unlimited and Elahmady took a chanse passing, I trust reda, he knowes these players better than all of us together:)|pg||
nt|tez: he played hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: they are not being helpful here. |pg||

nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|blum1956: but he needed the 1st round finess then|pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C coming up now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petepunt: need good wriggle after a weak nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: often 4! and 4 card suot |pg||
nt|lml: yes the momentum can certainly change but this is a very steady east-west pair|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3@S was not a good spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime back to board 20....|pg||
nt|tokay1975: %100 forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  9 as per the movie|pg||
nt|lml: I have never ever seen them get rattled|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bt: ns is precision style clubbers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ok  so specs we are just catching up here   no biddiing ust results|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: we are suffering a technical problem im fixing it|pg||
nt|mamos: the only swing so far was on Board 18   a real monster  - East at this table made a real error in defence of 6@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@C and 4 higher|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 5@C|pg||
nt|toral5: greco will probably bid 3@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: weak NT produces interesting situations|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good vul game and it will make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly mmisfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with no particular fits this hand is headed to 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry corrected now|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 NT good/bad now?|pg||
nt|xenya: S needs little from N for 5@C to be a good contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|blum1956: anyway 2@h looks like a standard contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT again|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they will try for more|pg||
nt|stc: last spot to go +|pg||
nt|andersk: I like this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for north.if he dutifully bids 3nt,@S suit is exposed|pg||
nt|xenya: just 4 cards in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: nope|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S would have been down 2 on best defence|pg||
nt|toral5: same contract in other room?|pg||

nt|tokay1975: just made 2nt |pg||

nt|mdgraham: Cunning lead. I believe Drijver did a similar thing against Bocchi some years ago in an Olympiad - Bocchi got the suit wrong|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: Teatime in England :)|pg||
nt|lml: Results from this event are at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm|pg||
nt|bt: west will lead a club and declarer will play on diamonds after running it to the 9|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looks like a strong club auction to me|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: declarer wasn't fooled by the lead|pg||
nt|tez: i mean..he played without any hope|pg||
nt|toral5: should 3@D on 3@C be treated as forcing?or ONLY 6-5 better hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: not forcing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@H cue is stronger bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H was almost GF|pg||
nt|xenya: at least N had no difficulty bidding 5|pg||
nt|toral5: @S ace not known yet.declarer does have problems|pg||
nt|xenya: if N happened to have an ace, he would have cuebid, then S bids 6 i think|pg||
nt|toral5: may be if he leads @S now,@D finesse will be marked|pg||
nt|toral5: in lieu of sementas 1@H opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: though with 3rd seat opening, no guarantees|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: my friend points out:if 3@H is near gf,wt is 4@D suppose to be on 3@C?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: might be key card for some pairs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|toral5: 6-3@D fit can be easily missed playing auto keys in the form of 4@D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petepunt: i think 2@s GOES 1 OFF BUT would age them 10 years in def!|pg||
nt|tez: he is very good player|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: Gold must have seen the DVDi|pg||
nt|lml: Thurston and Willis in the OR are also very steady players.  Not spectacular but few errors|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how declarer can get to 10 tricks here -- well, maybe with a little help from the opposition...|pg||
nt|xenya: N's @H9 may be a big card|pg||
nt|mamos: no may about it  :)  it's a BIG card|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm talking double-dummy though -- down 2 is not out of the question|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|yuval10: will be interesting to see if S will open in 3rd hand here|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: that must be the only interesting thing about this hand|pg||
nt|lml: well he didnt get a chance!|pg||

nt|lml: is this the right board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Two missing passes?|pg||
nt|xenya: we are missing two passes i think|pg||
nt|caitlin: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|toral5: another push coming up|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: Bapat has a tough bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: West probably feels he doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|vicky888:  yess,  maybe 1n|pg||
nt|lml: he wont pass|pg||
nt|lml: he can always raise diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: beautiful 6@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: surely the only 2 options I should think|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: 1NT seems possible...yep|pg||
nt|andersk: This should be an easy 4@H  If they bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 20 a moral victory this set for Bramley squad|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no one seems able to get hold of this match  chance for EW to bid a slam here|pg||
nt|bt: 4@C is more succesful here but i am stubborn :-)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will make unless they manage to cash the ace of @h in time|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzsv: I entered only final contrqct qnd score we will catch uo soon|pg||
nt|mamos: to explain for new specs e have had problems  ust catching up   normal service soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: tough to bid|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|mamos: he'll wish hed supported Diamonds now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  i m not sure 2d in place of 1n would show the strength he holds|pg||
nt|lml: a surprise lead|pg||
nt|lml: but actually diamonds is the better spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably Lev was too conservative|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3@dX may bring 800|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@C is my choise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: asked from 4 Y|pg||
nt|lml: he chose to open a lead directing club rather than his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand was nightmarish for EW -- think we can expect a minus from the other room as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@h now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andersk: 4@H is righthanded now|pg||
nt|stc: camberos runing out of boards|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this can be defeated and probably will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get to 4@S|pg||
nt|andersk: only 9 tricks if played in W with a @C lead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry about that |pg||
nt|andersk: Jxxx can be enuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you need luck|pg||
nt|tez: very hard to beat|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: excellent slam for EW now, with all their honours working|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, finally a good pick up for Bramley|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: sensible facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|stc: just cash the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: seems to me as a serious 3nt;seeking a minor cue from sementa|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andersk: I would not risk pass here|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Bruce|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: sry..i mean to 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: same answer, cash the first 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: cute he ducked the doubleton @DK confident he would get it anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: waiting for the photographer to finish before he does anything.|pg||
nt|bg: HI Vlad|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: if the difference is maintained, the teams are tied|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 147 apiece|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead to 3@c from N|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  have to trust partner|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: we would have expected them to bid that|pg||
nt|bg: note that Hampson doesnt bother with a bad suit vul preempt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: on the previous board, EW in the other room reached 3N -- also 3 down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: what would partner bid with: xx, 10xxxxx, xx,xxx?|pg||
nt|bt: so the cautious 4@C was a winner, i predict a few imps for mahaffey here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: North has to sort out that they can cash clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have done better to cash top Club at trick One before playing Heart|pg||
nt|vicky888:  it is inevitable now but to cash two top clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
nt|lml: actually it is a link to swan bridge|pg||
nt|lml: which has the running scores... either place will do|pg||
nt|petepunt: lev only has worjking 9 count and east cant really mve over 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe the safety play in trumps here is !K, then small to the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: will likely play K@d and @s to the Ace, following the opening by S|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreements but in this same auction, 4@h without blinking... I'm not sure why E didn't bid 4 with present hand|pg||
nt|xenya: only at these colours i bet :)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: can only bid 6 with mirrors|pg||
nt|andersk: I also agree 3 @h, but I will never risk pass witW hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if his pd had simply an invite hand, he'd bid 3@h... his 3@d says he has an even bigger hand... now QJ10xx is a great suit|pg||
nt|bt: cashing @DA would have been costly if east holding was T97 ...|pg||
nt|stc: I have 7 red cards and 6 black ones, an omen to lead a red :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: risky doesnt need that finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: my fault -- no practice finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: next slam for EW|pg||
nt|andersk: every day partner have 5  card+@H a game is huge favourite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, 7 imps to Bramley as they break into the scoring column|pg||

mb|2H|an|5 spades 4 hearts|nt|petepunt: 6@H by west is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: game is comfortable, yes|pg||
nt|stc: after 1@s by S good from any hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  last point... I'm sure they play lebensohl, so E hand is already limited to less than 8 hcp |pg||
mb|2S|nt|bt: one philosophy is to find the right suit as opposed to the right level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: now these don't fit as well|pg||
nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tez: i love support dbl:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1¬C shows 11-16 on this auction (1516 )|pg||
nt|lml: this will be quite a challenge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@H EW  - diamond lead gives a few problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you would be right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even by East - it doesn't matter after the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see a way to make this but lets see|pg||
nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is a very good contract but will fail unless declarer has x-ray vision |pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D could be 2+|pg||
nt|bg: 2 H good treatment shows 5-4 weak in majors|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: we'll be awash with coffee |pg||

pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|bt: so the lead will tell south who has @SAK, then a club finesse and the !K is placed, what is east doubling on??|pg||
pc|cK|nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 6 tricks off the top, declarer should make his contract, thus another swing for Lavazza team|pg||
nt|caitlin: I gather Pietro Forquet is in spec......pls join us commentating|pg||
nt|toral5: queens are co-operating wel here|pg||
nt|bg: if he happens to cash AK Dia and Ak spades he will make 4|pg||
nt|toral5: wlcm to the legend pietro forquet;and my favourite bridge player:)|pg||
nt|toral5: dont think he can make 4.1@S,1@C and 3@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|tez: if there were just one right, we would all play that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a @D after 2 trumps ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: but still.... extremely tough to do I think|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tez: that's why bridge is great|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
pc|d7|nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited as to how to play the hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||
nt|stc: HH are putting pressure on each board, very hard to play against them|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: now it remains to make it|pg||
nt|mamos: ok this will be interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: but not quick I guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I wonder about north's 4N bid.. could surely be a big winner but with 2 aces including a singleton ace on lead...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|vicky888:  so the only action brd till now is the first brd tht i missed ..yawn |pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, pretty much boring hands so far|pg||
nt|bg: gets two discards on club Q Dia J and throws 3 rd heat while W ruffs|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|petepunt: not so easy for polish club methods here|pg||

nt|toral5: ya cos duboin dint shift to @S at trick 2|pg||

mb|2D|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: are they about to be rescued|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some discussion, i cant hear|pg||
nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
nt|tez: very diciplined 3@h opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|22-23|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@h in this vuln|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 6N|pg||
nt|toral5: kibs saying 6nt in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: just open www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: 6N is superiour to 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||
nt|lml: these guys have played together forever so they probably do no what it means|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzsv: yes suit not strong, hard to read writing|pg||
nt|stc: Nunes passed but he also landed in 4@h !|pg||
nt|tez: fantonies dont play weak 2|pg||
nt|bg: looks good to us but how to play at table?|pg||
nt|toral5: both 6@S and 6nt is dependent on guessing @S queen|pg||
nt|xenya: or not -- sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: N thinking about Christmas|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bordeline balancing 3@C i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: 4@s from E is very easy if W showed opening values|pg||
nt|caitlin: South African transfer|pg||
nt|toral5: how superior?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this auction gives W a much better view of E's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: and 6+ @s's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 6n might go down a lot if things go badly|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch.13 away;unless open room misguesses the @S suit|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: EW  are likely to make a fair gain in any case|pg||
nt|stc: and eastern in the same time|pg||
nt|blum1956: Weak NT working!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Should've been thinking about his lead instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: looking like 800|pg||
nt|blum1956: The innocent 1@d opening with the North hand would have costed NS a lot |pg||
nt|blum1956: as compared to the weak NT|pg||
nt|stc: Weak NT is war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: punch thinking about the whole hand, not just this play|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe k@S or 8@S is the choice|pg||
nt|stc: not best lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  and still couldn't get to game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzsv: we are ok now live now|pg||

nt|bt: wouldve pushed s to 3@C|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|petepunt: 800 on @C lead only|pg||
pc|sK|nt|blum1956: two hearts, one spade and some number of trumps|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

nt|dburn: there was a time when an openign bid opposite an opening bid meant a game - these days, it means you might make a partial|pg||
nt|peachy: however, since they play light opening bids, responder had a role as well|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: all back now|pg||

nt|blum1956: 35!|pg||
nt|stc: 14 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend says whole different ball game. both agreed cant make 4|pg||

nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: you arrive as EW have a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Richie would just bid the cold 7NT|pg||
nt|reisig: shld be easy to reach 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||
nt|yuval10: won't be so easy to beat this one|pg||
nt|mamos: im having connection probs   sorry everyone|pg||

mb|2C|an|forces 2!D|nt|mamos: who likes 3N??/|pg||
nt|reisig: HATE IT|pg||
nt|mamos: not me|pg||
nt|reisig: But --- Huston will bid more|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C is 16+ so S looking ofr possible grand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: they won Spingold, 4 of them on Buffet Cup for U.S which won......so in good spirits I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
mb|2D|nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's contradicts Bird's law|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer will need to guess spades for his contract|pg||
mb|2H|an|invitational|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yess!!!  RR|pg||
nt|mamos: im told NS like the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
nt|toral5: no game makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 2@H was invitational|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards are 2@H also has a lot of play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bt: and west will lead a club, given east did not overcal 1@S hence no 5-suit there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
nt|tez: helness didnt like q of @d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||
nt|stc: On bad day you find Q10xx@s behind|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says he can make..but we will see:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 3N|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|vicky888:  the openeing 2@d is weak?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|reisig: I can just see Michael S's face :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk5: A claim would be accepted|pg||
nt|isp: "Bid as you like , make as you can |pg||
nt|gulyas: looks strong to me:)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  but that opening has caused this non-sacrifice|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||
nt|lml: tough defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now, the nice play of @s to the J paid off in the end, even when it virtually costs a trick at the beginning|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|h5|nt|petepunt: but more good days than bad days here :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|bg: nice to see Diamond, Gittleman and co on a roll Fred was an imp league teammate a few years ago In Toronto before he and Sheri moved to Vegas|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: action here|pg||
nt|tez: what do you open with S'S HAND|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: I have had a number of messages saying that a diamod switch cannot cost - probably not |pg||
nt|xenya: E could duck a heart -- but if he wins he should try to find a few quick tricks, not to set up the clubs with no entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I'd open that East hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you lose a club you still make 6@C  .... and go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 6-4 is very strong (w 2 aces)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks in Hearts|pg||
nt|lml: so like in the previous match a good start and then the mo switched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c = natural or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he would have done better to cash clubs first, hoping for an error |pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to restrain himself with this hand|pg||
nt|bt: multi 2@D saving east from a pemaly D in 3@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder if south had a penalty dbl available... either way I would pass|pg||
nt|bt: say 2@S-3@H-D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: Lev wondering about all this :)|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if Canada can get it back|pg||
nt|mamos: a normal result i'd expect|pg||

nt|bt: or even more juicy 3@S-4@H-D ...|pg||
nt|tez: 1@C or 1@d?|pg||
nt|bg: unless S rightfully gets carried away with an apparent undiscplined preempt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|reisig: Won't matter - however|pg||
nt|petepunt: upgraded is 14 to a 15-17 rebid here|pg||
nt|blum1956: Lev sitting with @h@s 55 and 14 HCP and listening for 1@h-1@s))|pg||

pc|cA|nt|stc: EW may cash the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: slim chance though|pg||
nt|mamos: wow that double is some call|pg||
nt|mamos: what is North supposed to do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: N SRY|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h an overbid as N has already denied 4 @hs|pg||
nt|bg: some pairs use 2 sia openings to show a really bad major and save the 2H/S openings for reasonable suits|pg||
nt|bg: Dia|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: no   4@h seems completely normal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, but I would prefer to look for a 4-4 spade fit first|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk5: Smolen auction perhaps|pg||
nt|reisig: BUT - if partner had KJx in @s -- we have slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you don't have a spade fit, you can get to hearts later|pg||
nt|tez: pass 1@c 1@d?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|stc: and will get a second chance|pg||
nt|lml: they have 25 hcp so 2nt vul might not the favorite|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. many aggressive players would open 3@s with this hand, though I am not one of them|pg||
nt|bessi2: Cohler at this point delighted to be playing only 2@h|pg||
nt|bt: the flaw for a weak 2 is the void and playability in 3 suits|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andersk: will lead @S now|pg||
nt|bt: and the flaw of the multi w @S is they have a comfortable 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gulyas: as long as they are not forcing declarer a lot in @Ds, he can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  read map has been given to opps|pg||
nt|andersk: Sadek will use the J to get the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone agree with N's 1NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it does help to know your partnership style with these borderline hands|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|nt|gulyas: 4-1 trumps could be a problem otherwise|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should play |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with 1 NT, however I would bid 3@h instead of 2 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s|pg||
nt|andersk: sometimes partner have 5@D 4@h and sometimes 6@d 5@H|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe they can overcall 2 NT with 65 in red's|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cQ|nt|petepunt: @H more likey than a low @S here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: low @S should be automatic|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably East should have discarded clubs in the reversed order|pg||
nt|stc: can you beat on @hs ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: showing the spade values|pg||
nt|stc: at IMP @s looks better to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: aagree easts @C should enc in @S if poss|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: he has a good chance of making this I think|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S had a simple 2@d rebid... he has a decent hand, a very broken @d suit and needs a lot of help from partner for any game|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|nt|xenya: brb|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: well that was a very good counter-move from south|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|blum1956: but it must be easy for West to work out the underlead anyway|pg||
nt|andersk: I totally agree|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@h is an overbid, but that was not the discussion:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|stc: 1@c shows the length but you have no bid on 1@s, 1@d lies but let you bid 2@c afterwards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bg: same auction in other room:) so what do I know:)|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||

nt|bessi2: I dislike 1@c most of all... think pass is best start,|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: 3N has little chance on a club lead (and careful defence thereafter), but 4@H appears to be cold on this lie|pg||

mb|2D|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||

nt|andyv:  styles matter.. in OR, N bid 1@d and S was able to show his values.  Both rooms reached same contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|gulyas: they cannot open up both @Cs and @Hs for the defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's X is quite dangerous, given the fact his Partner is the only limited hand in the table, when he already passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q|pg||
nt|bt: 3nt 600 ...|pg||
nt|tez: it is highly popular to open 1 nt with a solid color these days|pg||

mb|2S|an|8-11  4 spades|nt|mamos: well sorry I think NS got to the contract they deserved here|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: will -1190 be a good result since NS has 1430?  i think not, it isn't so easy to discover the 6@s |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|reisig: I guess this isn't one of those ...draw trump and claim hands|pg||

pc|dK|nt|andyv:  if @ds aren't 2-2, this hand is not making so finesse for Q should not be an option.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  fine contract and result in OR for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely tempting but Cohler cant do more than 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South could have doubled to show 3@h, is his pass alertable? I don't know|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: seems there is a bd 29 ???|pg||
nt|toral5: dint understand ferraros 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: this looks like some sort of intermediate 2@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: these 2@Ds seem to be in the 10-12 range or so|pg||
nt|lml: the India site is http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||
mb|1S|nt|reisig: Might reach the automatic 4@h here|pg||
nt|toral5: how come 29 started?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes http:/www.ecatsbridge.com/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i have no idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: 2@C natural?|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@s is making while NS have nine tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2@C for sure here|pg||
nt|blum1956: even ten tricks probably|pg||
nt|blum1956: maybe there are some computer problems again?|pg||
nt|xenya: funny|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: The real test ...comes later --- in claiming|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe 8-13 like the Italians?:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: might and automatic dont seem to belong in the same sentence :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is touch and go, but as long as u don't put up that @DK too early, you can make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: not that time, just thought a long time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: pass??!|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: HOLY ...something|pg||
nt|mamos: might was the right word|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h probably a relay to show stronger NT|pg||
nt|xenya: Canada need to reach 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: first board was 16|pg||
pc|h2|nt|reisig: Played ace?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT stright would've been lower range, i suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This could be Cambridge Precision from the late 70's|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|reisig: This is like a comedy act|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem rattled|pg||
nt|reisig: They should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: +5 is not correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, when you claim you have the option of claiming less tricks than the remaining. Please choose that option when declarer does not have the rest|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To the left in the window you can claim less tricks than the rest|pg||
nt|reisig: "break" = we NEED a drink!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It reads Less on the button|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|toral5: dummy is dead at trick 1:(|pg||
nt|bg: maybe they play 16 board sets|pg||
nt|toral5: no no|pg||
nt|toral5: 1st set was 14 brds|pg||
nt|cicus: no, 14 board a set|pg||
nt|caitlin: 14|pg||
nt|bg: then why no 29 Practice board?|pg||
nt|toral5: 5 top losers.so has to b a push|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joe how many boards?|pg||
nt|cicus: 29-16+1=14|pg||
nt|toral5: a kib points out,brd 15 is missing in the score card.so this has to be 15|pg||
nt|xenya: well if S plays back a @H now...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 14 and this is our 14th -- not suire why we started with 16|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: 2@H should make 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: probably more if you are trying for less @@  )|pg||
nt|gulyas: will probably draw trumps and settle for 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lml: you pretty well have to punt it with the East hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some day <i will learn how to spell..  |pg||
nt|xenya: well, yes -- but still|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d5|mc|8|nt|toral5: guess the set has ended now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no one seems to know why we started with 16 instead of 15|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty folks see you in hour!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: interesting that the open plays 56 bd matches.   the women play 60|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: women are in a later stage of the event so maybe that is why|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I sure hope we get finals of women's on vugraph!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: come back in 35 minutes for more action|pg||
