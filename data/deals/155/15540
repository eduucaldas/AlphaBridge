nt|hedyg: now 3@H cuebid (Nunes was told 2@H is natural)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but since Fantoni thinks 2@H is for @s.......|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok he was not alerted , thus it is natural sry|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: now Angeleri asks again about the 2d bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nunes happy to defeat 3NT in 100s to avoid further confusion|pg||
nt|syl: sry 200|pg||
nt|hedyg: since 4@H might possibly make he will not double 3NT which doesnt stand a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Angeleri turn for the puzzle|pg||

nt|hedyg: now Nunes is discussing with the director re different info both sides of screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but 2h was explained as spades by Villegas|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure, 3@H was a cuebid|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: brd 1 on the table now and director said 2 imps penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i wanted to explain the bidding but is pointless...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: you do not see the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i do not see all the cards lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: right this hand was not programmed by the computer|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: was just shuffled by director|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 imps penalty Zimmermann?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Traian?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so probably the decision was play all with 2 imps penaly to Camberos|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok, so 1 of their players came late and since the other matches had started they cancelled bd 1 for security reasons?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: contract 2nt with Fantoni on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes--Angeleri was the culprit|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 2 cup of coffee for his pd and himself........|pg||
nt|hedyg: cups|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: aparently was a problem with the sugar....|pg||
nt|hedyg: you have no Lavazza girls?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL the sugar|pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 1 would be on the internet from the start of play at any of the four tables in other matches|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Angeleri playing 2nt|pg||

nt|oosmanb: haha I've received an interesting comment, that if board 11 was presented as a bidding challenge, all the pairs here wouldve reached 3NT :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But in everyone's defence here, 4@H only fails because @S and @C are exactly 3 in each hand, (and north has exactly AA outside, so from South's point of view, 4@H should be better ...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: than 3NT|pg||
