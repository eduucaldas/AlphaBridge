nt|mgchat: ah ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what do we think about 4 spade bid?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, I suspect it has to do with the number of retirees who live there and it is a bit prejudiced on the strength of their game :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: South should clearly RDBL here, not 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: questionalbe pass by landen|pg||
nt|kareno: Let me quickly add that it was not so named by me.  I first heard of it in about 1969!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of any fast tricks suggests 4@H to me|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|wstuart: RDBL will show the A, pard will be in a position to judge if the single stopper is right for his intentions in any contract at any level.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT might keep them out of a slam or misjudge whether 3NT or 5@D is a better strain.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs a few good guesses here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|reisig: one "guess" goes away fast|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bg: questionable if 4 spades is a good bid then 4 hearts will not be a good bid result wise with 4 trumps and two aces I would probably let them play 4 hearts|pg||

nt|hedyg: not home yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bit early for dinner,  but it might be the cocktail hour |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we know from the GREAT showing in a couple of events this year, that Bessis pretty close to French Standard|pg||
nt|afulton: Looks like some sort of strong @c system by NS ... |pg||
nt|spooky: 6@S needed a @D lead to beat it.. this will be over soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: all matches playing same boards|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||

nt|spooky: A brave 4@H bid by South here, but I don't see another bid for south now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty common for big clubber to use "Michaels" rebid in the given auction -- so @H & @C/@D|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|chick: I think you need about 29-30 HCP to make 3N in a total misfit|pg||

mb|d|nt|bobh1: the @d suit is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: the North South pair are indeed Austrian... Doris Fischer + Bernd Sauer |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I suppose there is a missing pass from W|pg||
nt|passell: interesting hand slam without a dia lead game could go down with k of dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D asking for 3 card spade support, 4@C splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|passell: hi ralf|pg||
nt|chick: Operator, should this be 4@H in the North?|pg||
nt|passell: in slam percentage to pick up hearts  with the king of dia lead declarer will have to guess hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If decclarer takes a @c ruff in dummy, @hQ will be found easily|pg||
nt|chick: no, but if he takes a club ruff, then can pitch all diamonds on spades|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will lead dia king|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: no club ruff necessary|pg||

nt|spooky: this misfit will end in 3NT I guess|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C instead of 2@D  -- can someone explain that to me?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am told that N is by far the youngest on the team |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also defeat 5@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I must say I know very little about either pair |pg||
nt|spooky: @C suit is better, and you can probably relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: Perhaps, but often the opps will be more likely to defend 1NX than to double 2 of a minor for penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: after a @h support from E, I think that 4@d is a superior bid|pg||
nt|chick: Certainly if you are going to bid again, but apparently W didn't want to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Some specs will lead @hK! agree, a nice lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: e pulled K of H then put it back|pg||
nt|chick: if he had led it, would clearly switch to diamond at trick 2, but still doesn't beat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: w thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but after that EW has taken their 3 red tricks, there can be a guess in  trumph|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: so not systemic|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|chick: sure, and when one of the QJ falls, he may take the restricted choice finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now n thinking|pg||
nt|chick: Running scores here:  http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|chick: The danger of course is that a diamond switch is obvious if the spade finesse fails, so maybe he will just go for the drop|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 2@C was NOT automatic game force|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot to do for declarer and both black suits breaking badly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chagas-Levy stopped in 3@C on 19 [our 3N down 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kasimir-Jokish bidding this hand now   wonder if they'll stop in 3N|pg||
nt|afulton: frankly, Al, I've been looking at East hand... don't see any reason for 2@c v 2@d ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw - Jokish also responded 2@C   but that was game force relay|pg||
nt|afulton: other than 2@d will make auction easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can imagine -- only like @D if partner bids them first and @C soo much better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: and of course what you really want at that point is for the opps to rescue you :)|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: Bell & Byrne are a young and very promising pair from Manchester England|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays on @s3-1 he has to play on @c and go down|pg||
nt|afulton: (after starting with 2@d, of course) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm sure at the table i would have bid 2@D without thinking about it  -- maybe that's why Bessis' more successful  [ok, one reason they're more successful]|pg||
nt|afulton: rofla|pg||
nt|spooky: I think its a bit a matter of partnership style too...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3N west|pg||
nt|spooky: if partner knows you might not tell a 5crd suit, or bid any 5crd suit always, might change his bidding a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that this happens ONLY with @C & @D  otherwise show shape normally|pg||
nt|afulton: but if i tell partner I have 5@d's ... and he has said, "Oh I have 5@s's and 4@h's or more" do I really want to suggest @c??  |pg||

nt|dburn: although it would be an impressive effort indeed to discover that East does not have the jack of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn: presume that West is asking questions and East is answering them|pg||
nt|curtsolo: one of the keys is finding out that the @hQ is virtually irrelevant with the 10 card fit... Paul, do you know at what point the auction for EW diagnoses the 10 card fit?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: a grand does have some swindling chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: though 3@s is unusual in relay methods - maybe 3@h would be "revert to natural", or some such|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|pauleger: I think West is asking and knows, that East has 6@hs now, so @hQ is irrelevant|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probsbly at 3@d: 2@s = one suit; 3@d = 6|pg||
nt|dburn: well, we assume that East knows nothing about West's hand, but that West knows East has @sA, @hAK sixth, and @cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed without a spade lead squeeze cyhances are very good|pg||
mb|5S|nt|dburn: not "very good" - just poor to awful|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: true, whether you are using a relay or a simply Jacoby 2nt response, generally responder is going to take control of the auction early and maintain captaincy throughout|pg||
nt|roswolf: well much better than my usual grands anyway|pg||
nt|pauleger: I am wondering, David, did you see a player asking for jacks before? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I have seen some auctions in systems such as Ultimate Club, Viking Club and Symmetric where it has been possible to ask for jacks|pg||

nt|curtsolo: this is when the weak is most effective... neither opponent has a particularly easy entry into the auction yet both essentially have opening values|pg||
nt|curtsolo: and getting in there vul, you might be taking your life into your hands :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|skaftij: Would have taken quite some nerve for South to come in with 2NT 2nd round|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: you lose imps by being too passive as well as being too aggressive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|curtsolo: were the NS hands switched it might have been easier... but Chagas in the passout seat is looking at KQJ of @h, wrong holding to balance|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|the saint: What is 2N for example?|pg||
nt|rado: pass - 1@S now|pg||
nt|the saint: The penny drops...|pg||
nt|rado: anyway NS should avoid 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this match is from GROUP J|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a clear 1N respoonse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, private|pg||
nt|chick: Peter, did the 1@H (showing spades) also deny 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|spooky: 2NT from North or 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 for me|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so it looks like NS play weak NT, probably invalidating my earlier comment|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, NS play strong club, weak NT|pg||
nt|chick: at least S won't be distressed at that bid|pg||
nt|spooky: as we saw this complete segment, NS bid aggresive :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rado: S opening 1@S N bidding 2@D probabvly:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps the guide book will help us on the hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: think we are missing a pass operator |pg||
nt|the saint: Specs need to rotate themselves 90 degrees|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N very understandable - especially VUL|pg||
nt|spooky: this is abou the overtricks, @CQ won't be a problem and @DK is onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: last auction was correct|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: except that operator will have difficult time leading and playing this hand |pg||
nt|the saint: VG - NS and EW are mixed up|pg||
nt|sybarra: as in "impossible" |pg||
nt|chick: rkc turns out not to be very helpful here ... they will seem to be off 2 keycard|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: s writing note to w|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe no double now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|chick: Peter, you are teammates with EW at times, right?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes unlucky for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but:  no @D filler,  probably @C length in East|pg||
nt|spooky: it's understandable, but does south never have KQJ109 of @D and a random Q?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|the saint: I sympathise, as a VG operator it is an easything to do|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: Pinot Noir got 6 imps on the last board when East-West played 2HX|pg||
nt|lml: the AKQJx found the penalty double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they were pleased to get away from me for this event|pg||
nt|pitiful:  see how far they have to go...|pg||
nt|chick: W trying to decide whether to push them, double, or go quietly :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I will be there tomorrow to start my duty |pg||
nt|pitiful:  west hates to pass with a void in opponents suit|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  Chagas 5@C North  [where our table 3N down 1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Great Shuffler is on Fishcher's side this hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rado: good luck Shirley:)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|lml: I have previously watched the Pinot Noir team play and they were excellent in that match too|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm did she need to lead @CJ to King??|pg||
nt|spooky: she didn't the @C8 can still be overtaken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case 4-0|pg||
nt|afulton: the issue is: |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that they're 3-1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: he managed not to push them into a makeable slam though :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: not sure about the reopening at these colours with that porous suit and defensive cards and shape....but Thomas some time ago traded his pass cards for some magic beans|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: @C to J  @CA, @C  |pg||
nt|spooky: maybe Al, but she can afford to lose 1@C to East I think...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|afulton: If she gets the @c's wrong, and Michel wins... @s will come right back|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: can lose @C only because @D33|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: i think @CJ at trick 3 then 3N is cold regardless of East @D length|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: not so difficult to play W with 5440 now|pg||
nt|chick: and the failure to X will gain them a lot of imps|pg||

nt|sybarra: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not surprisingly, considering the shaope and texture of that E hand, the balance converted a nice plus into a minus...and it gave the opponents a chance to turn a minus in 1NT to a ...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: do not believe in Slam try ... simply once @S and 3NT by East|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||

nt|spooky: why did thomas lead a small @H and not the J or the 10?|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|the saint: No muppet stayman for these two|pg||
nt|danilo1: I believe 2@H/@S some kind of relais ... and 3@C kind of Stayman|pg||
