nt|kareno: Henry :)  Jim :)  Raija :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like pushy players who get to game E-W will be disappointed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Only 8 visible tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kareno: Might make 3nt with a diamond lead.  However, I would pass 2nt with that west collection of tram tickets.|pg||
nt|tlc: altho with a diamond out they may still arrive at 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  And South might not lead a @h if West Staymans|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I bet no diam lead...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tlc: very true...after stayman a heart is unlikely|pg||
nt|kareno: Not against two nt for sure.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|kareno: 2 will fetch though with clubs working.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: leading to 2NT should not take too great risks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: Hampson giving count.  |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: Hampson might not continue hearts, not knowing 8 and 9 spot position|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tlc: lebi may still  make 3 by end playing geoff in hearts after cashing his winners|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  The defense might get tricky now. I was going to say both players have tough discards on the clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Geoff solves the diamonds - he can see no way to beat the contract in hearts.|pg||

nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: you are funny Hedy... its good to have your around|pg||
nt|marlowepi: font know their style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've just started board  13 so we'll have to wait|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C for me with that shape. seldom any insurmountable pressure where your major is spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: discussing last auction.  bidding showed minimum HCP but extra shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-3@C from Nystrom?     their 2N opening is @C & @D but with 12-15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: worst relay in the system...  laughter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: an anemic overcall|pg||
nt|bobh1: trading on the colors i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Linda :) i love it and guess it shows..also fun with you!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed Marshall -- no reason not to show the real distribution  but some 5-card majorites ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bobh1: so this is a stolen bid situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes even good pairs play "stolen bid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: most of those majorites burn to a cinder before they hit the ground|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel can't sit, can he?     for that matter -- can Nystrom?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the other room East (Baxter) didnt defend quite as well as Sementa.  he failed to keep an exit card|pg||
nt|lml: the British Lions are first in the E division|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: these two teams had a tough battle earlier  just one imp|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: 3NT by W on a 9@d lead in OR last bd|pg||
nt|lml: I mention this because Paul Gipson blogs and he has been giving me a hard time about ignoing him|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: it is quite unexpected|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: nystrom, comment <should be some useful cards there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: S might have explored 3N as an alternate spot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: I hope he does well... I have my favorites|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he can make this too|pg||
nt|hedyg: dpnt we all?|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont*|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: about the last board specs have been pointing out that they acution was different in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: West didn't have a chance to support hearts and it made it hard for East to unblock|pg||
nt|lml: yes the LIONS have a bye this match but that is only 11.5 VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H fixing trump, 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff comercial.  Check out www.bridgetopics.com |pg||
nt|hedyg: 11.5 is an usual score for a bye, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Lauria requested a restroom break...  id offer to fill in but...  :)|pg||
nt|lml: yes but some people suggested the LIONS were helped by it... don't really think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol April|pg||
nt|lml: after all this is over I am going to start reviewing bridge websites in my blog.  There are so many new ones.|pg||
nt|lml: Van Cleeff has one of course and several others|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: I don't know if Van Cleeff is on facebook, bridgeblogging is of course|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|lml: maybe bridge is coming into the modern era|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: 7 top tricks -- maybe there's an endplay available|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: N was hoping heart JT would be doubleton. but EW would still have the tempo|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kittyc: BridgeWinners is on facebook too, they are running a contest each day to pick Rosenblum winners in KO stage|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: this is actually going fairly well for declarer despite the bad diamond break|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|xenya: sorry, silly of me -- @SJ is 8th |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: but what's the harm in @S first?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks Kitty|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: Bridgeblogging has a contest as well ... if you want to check it out.  All you have to do is name the 5 countries with the most winners|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: never mind -- then 4 losers|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s8|pc|c8|nt|bobh1: he will have to guess @ss|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h9|nt|lml: he should though I would think|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobh1: i guess he knows about Sementa's @ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: from the auction|pg||
nt|lml: West has to have hearts left|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: unless West pysched|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: yes plus he can count the hand out|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: 9 now -- S had 3 opportunities to get rid of that @H10|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: 1@c forcing n/s I believe.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|tlc: which is just as well since it will go down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes they play a variant of Meckwell Precision|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kareno: 6@s not good at all.  Loses a diamond and a club |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I spoke too quickly, as usual|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'm often guilty of the same offense, Henry.  Gets worse with age :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
pg||

nt|kareno: It's an IMP|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|tlc: it's tricky when the Q@C is led..it is freq right not to cover,as when partner has Txx..declarer has guess on next round|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2H!|nt|kareno: Showing spades, no doubt |pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S do best to take their down one save in 5@c|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s makes with very few points between the two hands.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: 1@h apparently suction - spades or clubs and diamonds.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|tlc: 3@S by lebi would likely have inspired hanna to take the "save"|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Now par is the 'save' by n/s.|pg||
nt|peachy: NS have a save, but  now N does not know of the dbl fit, but he might still take it|pg||
nt|tlc: the 3@H raise by partner certainly reduced his defensive potential|pg||
nt|kareno: South might have bid on with four clubs.  But equal vulnerability, it seems unappealing.|pg||
nt|tlc: and geoff probably felt he had already streched to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|peachy: in a close match (so far) dubious decisions might be taken conservatively, so he might pass too|pg||
nt|kareno: Some kind of defensive mishap in the CR it seems.|pg||
nt|tlc: im assuming since there had been no heart raise..North tried to cash 2@H|pg||
nt|kareno: At the five level, I use the King lead to demand count.  |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|kareno: Apparently this was the mishap in the CR - two rounds of hearts trick one.  Another sort of mishap in this room by n/s.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tlc: so after all this Japcan will likely gain +2|pg||
nt|peachy: Dbl must be non-pu;;ab;e for them|pg||
nt|peachy: non-pullable|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the tempo of the double made it non-pullable.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: or perhaps there was temo issue identifiable and Hampson ethically left it in|pg||
nt|tlc: south must have been very worried with club length and such a ratty hand to sit|pg||
nt|peachy: tempo|pg||
nt|kareno: No defensive mishap here but not enough tricks either.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was different some decades ago|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it was a bad lead though|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
mb|5S|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||
nt|lml: Solani is sort of endplayed but he can get out a spade|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: on this lead some chances|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
mc|11|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||

mb|1N|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||

nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||

nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||

mb|p|nt|vicky888:  :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||

nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||

nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||

nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||

nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
