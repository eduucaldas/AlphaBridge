mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S will not play well,  and 3 nt is a bit iffy also |pg||
nt|wstuart: that was meant to be a question, "you know him?" but I forgot teh punctuation.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next question -- which is best   1@H or 2N to show 2-lowest|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1D|nt|anton72: could u explain for us this move from S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C, usually no 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: S was dummy, she didnt move|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 7@H looks good|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall will also open 2@C since they play a form of Precision|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes Hedy, i meant 3@D  ...  somebody shoot me |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Allegaert has interesting problem over 3@D      4@D made it easier to get to game|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|kdr_fm: @SA and another versus @s contract probably best but looks like 8 solid tricks|pg||

mb|1S|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how good Allegaert needs to be to open in 1st seat|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interestingly, he now lives in my home town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.|pg||
nt|sybarra: PSZCZOLA   those are not the letters we usually see in that order|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: suction bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they play suction over 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right, I think 2@H is supposed to be Suction  a) @S  b) @C & @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some mixed raise?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S LR+ I would say.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Suction is a favorite treatment in New Zealand over strong 1@C/2@C and some use it over 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any option that doesn't need @S finesse?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @CQ coming down and endplay in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ruff out @ss and same hand has Kx in @D and Q@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: or Qx in @c and K@D on side.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hadn't thought about guessing @DKx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my sliderule tells me -- just take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier when we see the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: it means the bee in polish (his name)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now offering choice of games between 3NT and 4@H.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: peeking at the hands confirms that :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|wstuart: Weird 4@D bid by Caputo.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt was easier?|pg||
nt|wstuart: If Middelem was willing to play 3NT, why is south bidding 4@D?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|nt|kdr_fm: 3NT lucky with the 4/4 @C split makes 9 tricks - 4@h looks like a make with the @DQ dropping|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wstuart: From one of our specs:  "PSZCZOLA pronounceed [pshchowah] means bee"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kdr_fm: 4@d looked like a cue which seems alot on the S hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: still now sure I could say it even with pronounciaton |pg||
pc|s2|nt|wstuart: Someone suggested that 3NT was a non-serious 3NT, i.e., a mild slam try.  I don't think this is the case for two reasons:|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @DT gives him a @d finesse option|pg||
nt|wstuart: 1) South was willling to play in 3@H.  He can't possibly have even a mild try after that. and |pg||
