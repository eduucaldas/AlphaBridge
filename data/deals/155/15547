nt|mdgraham: You need to set partnership rules about when they apply - one practical rule of thumb is that if you have bid a game which you clearly expect to make on power, pass is forcing  |pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1N|nt|garnetts: depends on what happens next as they say |pg||

nt|stoffers: if he had bid somewhat hard earlier in the bidding, he would lie on his number of aces..like 4NT-5@d one ace. Now his partner could bid the relay suit to ask: do you REALLY have ...|pg||
nt|stoffers: only one ace?|pg||

nt|stoffers: Now, here the spade play was for the overtrick..|pg||
nt|garnetts: That spade finesse has endangered the contract |pg||
nt|stoffers: he needs clubs to be 3-3 or the K@s right now|pg||
