nt|layzi: think they will bid slam here!|pg||
nt|djneill: so the pushy 1NT may have lost|pg||
nt|djneill: assuming playing 15-17, would you have opened 1NT lasse? 3rd seat fav|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|djneill: (nonvul vs vul = fav)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|layzi: also here NS make game! but EW have a good save in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill: I think I might have|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|djneill: West has game interest|pg||
nt|djneill: 23 and partner opened!|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|djneill: East's 2@d may be a waiting bid or a relay response, but it looks good|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|layzi: 6@h makes but impossible to bid|pg||
nt|djneill: West can't take the joke|pg||
nt|djneill: West's 2@h set up a game force (perhaps 2@c was not game forcing)|pg||
nt|djneill: 4th suit forcing to game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|layzi: Sandum explained 3@d as both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|layzi: great lead from karlsen|pg||
nt|djneill: East shows the complete shape - now West may be looking for grand in 7@d on the 4-4 fit (can ruff a club if clubs 4-1)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|layzi: even just said i will get 10 triks an claim|pg||
nt|layzi: now they will bid slam, but 6 or 7?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|djneill: East has 2 keycards whatever the trump suit is|pg||
nt|djneill: West can ask for extra Kings now with 5NT?|pg||
nt|layzi: 7NT makes aloso so no problem.. |pg||
nt|djneill: as clubs and diamonds break, 7 of anything will make, but lasse will they do it?|pg||
nt|layzi: yes i think they will|pg||
mb|5N|nt|layzi: pass showing even better cards..|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|layzi: now 6@d|pg||
nt|layzi: and 7NT|pg||
nt|layzi: i guess|pg||
nt|djneill: hmm, 6@c may be tricky - if they are not sure what trumps are - if 6@c is "the @cK" when @d trumps, they get to 7|pg||
nt|djneill: I believe West is going to try 7@d since it is better than 7NT when East has @cKx|pg||
nt|layzi: Dad thinks now!|pg||
mb|7D|nt|layzi: need a @c ruff for 500|pg||
nt|layzi: nice discard from ruud|pg||
nt|layzi: 3 @h non forcing and blackwood.:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: father knows best|pg||
nt|layzi: yes he do|pg||
nt|djneill: expect 7@c or 7NT in the other room|pg||
nt|djneill: East's nice 2@d I believe was the cause of this, but it is very attractive choice for various reasons|pg||

nt|djneill:  North's @c duck was not totally wrong, only if West has a singleton is it wrong, and even then it might not matter sometimes since the @cK would be able to pitch a loser, but I can't see that ever needing to pitch a loser there|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  should North have tried 4@s over 3NT (surely 3NT was a long @c suit)|pg||

pc|d5|nt|layzi: as i said the 5@c save was relay good:) getting 11 imps for "syntax error"|pg||

nt|layzi: think that will cost some imps|pg||
nt|djneill:  we can guess E-W will get to 4@h in the other room, and it has problems too - ruffing @s with those @h sets up a trump for N-S|pg||
nt|djneill:  N-S did not get to slam on the earlier 5@d either in the other room|pg||
nt|djneill:  East might be able to bid 2@s naturally over North's 1@s response|pg||
nt|djneill:  a rare natural cue-bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|layzi: shold be possible to find! but they will not bid alone...|pg||
nt|djneill:  bravo to West's 3NT previous board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|djneill:  West has 4-4 majors but vulnerable, with no singleton, dangerous|pg||
nt|djneill:  to overcall |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: tough rebid for N here|pg||
nt|layzi: last result: http://www.rondanecupen.no/resultat/2010lag.htm|pg||
nt|layzi: that wold cost|pg||
mb|d!|nt|djneill:  South has 7 tricks in the form of 3@h, 2@d, 2@c, while E-W can only get 4@s, 2@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  but South may play for 75% - hook @c then later hope @s is onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: big club wd fare better i guess-1c-1d-2d-2s-4s|pg||
nt|layzi: 3NT the best contract on W hand:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|layzi: not god news for the leders, they will go on a big lose here!|pg||
nt|djneill:  I can't see the @d play being anything but clear though|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think 4@c could have been more damaging theoretically but in practice 3NT introduced the ambiguity in N-S agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks like 3d showed spd supp as well, wd|pg||
nt|layzi: shold be easy to bid slam here...|pg||
nt|djneill:  not sure what East's double here followed by 2@s is supposed to mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|layzi: not al|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  normally I would think the double would show 4441 or similar, unable to double the first time|pg||
nt|djneill:  worked out|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  now comes the @s (South cashed the @cA to reveal that) - West's @d6 may have been discouraging for @h|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has the god-given AK to lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|layzi: dont understand the rush..|pg||
nt|djneill:  well done|pg||
pc|h4|nt|layzi: some more imp to Gutta på tur "the guys on tour"|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|layzi: but he have to find the @D Q|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @sJ dropping, @dKx onside (and possible minor squeeze) should make short work of this|pg||
nt|djneill:  but their teammates went down 200 as East chose not to show the @s|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|djneill:  now is South squeezed on the 4th spade?|pg||

nt|layzi: wd|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|djneill:  ok East is planning to score 8 tricks via the ping-pong method|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|djneill:  South did not expect this from the @cA cash|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have picked up the @d suit with a duck at trick 2 but I think it may run into a @d ruff in some lines anyways|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can ruff a spade low without giving up a natural trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: Burrrows doesnt know h ak are behind his queen, so will hope to guess dia|pg||

nt|layzi: last bord before the break, start over at 1430:) |pg||
nt|layzi: now the last bord of this match...|pg||
nt|djneill:  nice defense for E-W|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok a rule of 11 1@d opening by father West?|pg||
nt|djneill:  this is the last hand of the set, thanks lasse|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  in other room earlier, the 3NT was also attempted over the natural 2@s opening (West with 4522 chose 2NT rather than 3@h)|pg||
nt|djneill:  it appears syntax has been in the running for the lead in the event but this knocked them out of that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|layzi: last game in this match.. looks like a win for Gutta på tur....|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|djneill:  thanks to some slam bidding by Utkantnorge|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|layzi: Sandum ask Ruud why the rush?|pg||
nt|djneill:  normal-looking @s lead gave nothing away and later North ducked the @dK when West hooked the @dQ, killing the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|layzi: 3NT also the best contract here!|pg||
nt|layzi: ty all |pg||
nt|djneill:  east's 2@c I do not agree with, vulnerable, flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok so N-S here play multi for the bad weak two's and 2@h/@s for the good weak twos|pg||
pc|dK|nt|layzi: sandum is not happy now|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has the @hK which looks like a sure trick given East's takeout double|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|djneill:  but on normal defense this is down - 2@d, 1@h, 1@s (can pitch @h on @c)|pg||
nt|djneill:  East on lead, the @dA looks normal, is he thinking of doubling?|pg||
nt|djneill:  surely partner is broke, unless South is psyching|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|djneill:  East does not like having the AK in a 4 card suit, much better 3 card suit (less likely to be ruffed)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
