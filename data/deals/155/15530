nt|vugraphzsk: good morning|pg||
nt|lml: hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi linda|pg||
nt|bobh1: april|pg||
nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|henryb:  A Roland 20-20|pg||
nt|yuval10: Meckwell is having their rest at first session, as usual|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|an|2 hearts 8+|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I cannot add: 21-19|pg||
nt|stc: What do we know about NS methoids ? Acol ? Weak NT ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: a dull 3N to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Marshall!!!  welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think I would bid 2@H now with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: an exciting deal to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi April:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: NS-- strong NT, dia, hearts, and spades promise 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: club could be 1 if 4X1|pg||
nt|henryb:  East should be grateful that he was not left in 1@hXX|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|mamos: all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: welcome to this round of 64 match|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: hi April|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||
nt|lml: no but I think North should be|pg||
nt|lml: the points are very soft and he has shown about this much|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a lot of cards altho they may not be useful ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: quick note, I can only see one side of the table when screens are down so bids will be delayed until the board comes back.|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N will bid again because its imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hargreaves sementa|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby play a weak NT except 3rd seat VUL   but rarely open 1N with this shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: @H@H@H@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I dont have that yet. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|mcphee: as often happens in these cases when partner is broke, the 2 level is way too high|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mamos: a fairly quiet start while we all get settled down|pg||
nt|stc: now @c|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lml: this contract is very tight.  |pg||
nt|lml: it might make if east can be enplayed somehow|pg||
nt|lml: cash the @HQ and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: ducking was better|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oliverc: now ok|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: 9 cl droping makes the contract safe|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|bobh1: seems to be a trick short|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  now one trump and a @d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|roswolf: brian is not a slow player - isuspect a technical problem|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: only BBO is at the Marriott, the rest of the games are in the convention center|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: e/w play 4 card majors --grrrrrr|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Ouch|pg||

nt|delberto:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm even though i am english i consider acol a poor system for this level of play|pg||

pc|s4|nt|roswolf: they play a strong nt|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||

pc|h4|nt|dburn: you would need to guess well, but you might make it|pg||
nt|jtr: Meckwell would be in it if they were in the other room|pg||
nt|delberto:  3NT has definite chances and probably depends on how the hhearts are played|pg||
nt|jtr: Upgrade to 14 no doubt|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 2@C has no upside|pg||

nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: these guys are fast players.. <i will try to keep up|pg||
nt|yuval10: he prably cashed 8@s as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: west in the oR responded 2@C and went onto 3@C which looks over optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC for EW from 2010 European Championship online at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
nt|lml: good morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: good morning|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N or 2N by East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
nt|riccho: hi everybody|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: hi April.  Good to work with you again|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive opening here from Martel|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what methods East-West use, but these are likely to get them to a hopeless game fairly quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can see   2@C neither promises a 4-card major  nor  points :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in days of yore when one picked up a hand like N has one could expect to open the bidding. nowadays one is lucky to be able to open if one holds it in second seat. 4th chair? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fuhgedaboutit|pg||
nt|mamos: ndo???|pg||
nt|mamos: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas ... Roland :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello Karen|pg||
nt|henryb:  I approve|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|tlc: may i join the fun?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jim -- you want to psyche or DBL???|pg||
nt|stc: conservative bid by katz, but well judged|pg||
nt|yuval10: no spots and very soft points, so E downgraded|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner could not open 1N, and will bid again with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: unfortunately for him it looks as if 3NT has a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sry, got distracted on last handò dec led a second heart, which Katz ducked....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: the K @s is suspect but you never know|pg||
nt|riccho: I´m not able to imagine an american pair playing sth different from WK2 opening|pg||
nt|dburn: however, hopeless is as hopeless does - if declarer plays a secodn trump, South needs to cash out|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: Is this the real auction?|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction is out of sync but I think we can see what is happening  1@h from South f 1NT from North|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT I guess coming|pg||
nt|kareno: I get it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And it's an easy 3nt.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when I played 10-12 NT  i would try 2N as West -- but that was natural invite back then|pg||
nt|stc: now 3NT has a lot of play !|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|dburn: and not do anything heroic like underleading @hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tlc: seems on this auction that stansby might try 3nt w/ many more HCP than he might have|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|riccho: but with the red aces this shouldnt be a big problem|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s tricks and 2 in each other|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: everyone is asking me about the running scores... go to www.bridgeblogging.com and click on the link|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think this will work out well for Auken though|pg||
nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: If clubs can be only 3 long, that is a quirky bid.  I don't know their system, however.|pg||
nt|mamos: so for ayone confused by the auction we think South opened 1@H North responded 1NT and South bid 2@C  Im not sure why North thought 5@C was right|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some specs are already asking for the link to the running standings.  please publish if you have it.  thanks!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: 98 is a huge score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that....however, he might transfer and bid 3N, though action is doubtful, since that would at least give him two ways to win|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: I dont know. a spade back and a club|pg||
nt|lml: ruff ruff and a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: You can go to either www.bridgeblogging.com and push the button at the top or go to www.bridgwinners.com|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Apteker-Wolfson match, both tables landed in 3NT here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@c in OR looks like ab accident|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tlc: agreed..aassuming they have that agreement on this auction(probably yes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stansby understandably went low because they probably intervene aggressively against these EW methods|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|lml: they both point to the same place|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Luckily for declarer, clubs and hearts are friendly and it will fetch.  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno: Wonder if eas |pg||
pc|s8|nt|stc: we have the first medium swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: or a very weird decision by W to leave 2@c|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: no surprise  Bathurst-Zagorin had a free run to get to 4@H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if my opponents wanted to play 4H with Jxxxx facing AK, i would not want to disrupt their auction either:):)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the kindest thing that could be said is that 5@C was lucky|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Drury not remembered, probably|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: that would have worked linda but W didnt try for it|pg||
nt|kareno: Wonder if east will block the clubs and beat this.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: no it might be too hard to work out|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: very likely :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|lml: about now Lauria is wondering why he didn't double!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|9|nt|yuval10: EW here will be quite revived to win 6 instead of a possible -6 had EW in the other room find the game|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1ST4HAT93D54CAKT82,SKJ98532HKDKJ7CQ3,SHJ654DQ9632CJ754,SAQ76HQ872DAT8C96|sv|e|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: this was a flyer by west  since i am told 2@C is usually forcing to 2nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: Maybe a save here  But it wont be easy to find|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: well, not by a passed hand it isn't - 2@c was just the wrong bid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: well this will be played in a minimum of 4@S|pg||
nt|delberto:  interesting deal..possibly reaching the 5-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Zia decided not|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but North-South will probably go quietly|pg||
pc|c4|nt|delberto:  they did|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Kendrick says it is idiot proof and shows his hand|pg||
nt|delberto:  A then K to indicate the heart ace ?|pg||
nt|dburn: more chance to find a save playing a method in which a 1@c opening shows clubs, but no one does that nowadays|pg||
mc|10|nt|delberto:  quite right hehe|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1ST4HAT93D54CAKT82,SKJ98532HKDKJ7CQ3,SHJ654DQ9632CJ754,SAQ76HQ872DAT8C96|sv|e|nt|lml: one more time www.bridgeblogging.com or www.bridgewinners.com for the link to the running scores|pg||
nt|mamos: it seemed that North had little idea what South's shape was so East was a little unlikely to know either|pg||
nt|dburn: duly accomplished in jig time - having spent this afternoon watching Weichsel, Feldman, Sadek and El-Almahdy, I must say that it is refershing to see bridge being played at normal ...|pg||
nt|dburn: tempo|pg||
nt|riccho: rofl|pg||
nt|stc: to beat 3NT S must lead a @cH and switch to a @h when ducked, not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c seem like a good sacrifice for NS, but other room didn't find it, though they bided and supported the suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|riccho: the only advantage is than, that you get the results from the other table|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one way or another board 2 will be a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S, usually not 10 HCP & 5332|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, strong no trump, nothing much else special for North-South|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: very good sac in 5@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's some X by North with very minimal values|pg||
nt|stc: 9 or even 10 tricks in @c contract|pg||
mb|5H|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Nystrom-Bertheau  almost all hands with 16+ HCP start with 1@C [some 16 have options]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned double from N...some would bid 2H as that is the most likely place for game. but here Martel is not willing to bid 2H then back in with douyble, so he preferes to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: show the polyvalent nature of the hand immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if any other vugraph session has seen/heard the use of 'polyvalent'|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|tlc: sounds very chemical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vocabulary quiz at end of set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S torn between H and NT, H will win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Martel's action was a Forcing Pass situation -- where 2@H weaker than PASS then bid|pg||
nt|kareno: That double announces a penalty pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if S bids he is more likely to bid 5@h, which will be very costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think|pg||
nt|stc: why not 4NT and 5@h on 5@d ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
nt|mamos: that 1@S overcall was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|kareno: No but if you don't get your suits into the auction, you can be run over on the partscore hands.|pg||
nt|mamos: the danger on this hand seems to be of settling in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: X|pg||
nt|stc: and very happy on 5@c !|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to guess since 1N was artificial|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because I think 4N and then 5@h should be a slam try|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll be ok with careful play, i believe|pg||
nt|stc: when a vul op bids 4@s ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, even then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: screen down; Robson asking questions|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, torn between raising hearts and trying for NT via 2S|pg||
nt|tlc: this time the conservative view will not pay off..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and who can blame him?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|riccho: I have to admit I would have doubled this|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps 5@c was the solution, N looks to have no points, good hope for a 3 suiter|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And you've exactly identified what was about to happen.  @h Q to beat it.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has a reasonable X, for sure|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|stc: In OR NS knew about the @c fit but decided not to preempt, strange ?!|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the OR North knew his partner had at least three clubs. He did not know about five|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has every reason to think that the black suit strengths of the defense are massed behind those of the offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin opened Stansby's hand so they had relatively free run to 4@H  again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and it is a NV game|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|nt|mcphee: here I think the 2@D call is too much from W|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: The Cayne team have started strongly |pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  And S did not know his partner was that short in @s|pg||
nt|stc: If Zia x 3@c N will know better about the fit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: South needs Kx of diamonds in the pocket and it isn't happening.  He may play diamond to the ace (expecting spade ace in west) just in case of singleton in east.|pg||
nt|stc: oops|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an important guess. He might well go down four now|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@h now|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yuval10: appearently it is for W|pg||

pc|sK|nt|dburn: even so, when the opponents have an "impossible" auction - they were prepared to play 2@s a round of bidding ago - you might double them in four|pg||

nt|lml: yes something lingering with oil is the usual punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where our NS in partscore and other table game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he thinks it will be an 8 card fit. having said all that, LKosing Trick Count still says "stop thinking and bid a game already"|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a good score for Cayne in the OR  - not so easy to avoid this outcome I think|pg||
nt|dburn: not that Janet de Botton was expecting to be in game - she was catering for a better part score if partner happened to have three spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|stc: K@s was not good :(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: K@s wasn't the problem, it was still -4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: W has only 3 card support opposite a poor hand and what could be a 4 card suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: 4@S down 4 deservedly lost a bunch of imps.|pg||
nt|lml: So far it seems like the Auken team is trying too hard|pg||

nt|riccho: yes careful bidding but partner ....|pg||
nt|yuval10: had E just discard a @s over the @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it turns out that the first two recorded scores are played in 6|pg||
nt|mamos: Polish Club|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with 3 prime cards, north's optimism had a solid basis|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzsv: 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: This match is between the leaders of this group.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd time in a row  their NS went down|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @d ruff and 2 last tricks is for E with his trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kareno: 1@d negative |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: another potential gain for Zaleski here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: would you have overcalled 1@S with the north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: up to 14 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: I think I might have|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: only if they bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6d are very gd spot|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|panosk: even beter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzsv: Just FYI < I can only see one side of the screen.  So bids by N & E are delayed until the board comes back.  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i suspect we'll finally see same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, alerts are only from the W S discussions|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
nt|panosk: they ll stop at 6 i think lets see if he makes 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got too much to never do anything|pg||
nt|lml: After making a grand he was just worn out|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: maybe coffee or drink of choice time|pg||
nt|kareno: NP Jan :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: he probably heard what you said about two pairs out of two missing it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the knockout phase (starting tomorrow), the brackets will be formed taking into account both the WBF master points and the ranking in the round robin|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oliverc: much better|pg||
nt|panosk: he cant make 7 here though|pg||
nt|lml: Suit showed five spades and four hearts nicely|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz took a minute to play Dace, now says I had not problem on the first trick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: I think this will work out okay though.  north south dont have all that much|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: intersting April -- normally operator can see all  [know all, etc]|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: North should make this.  He is going to guess spades on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: and East has no entries|pg||
nt|lml: he really can't make it without spades, he may as well go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after heart ace (if W wins it, he should lead back D 5|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: well now we have only 1 other pair bidding the grand and four missing it|pg||
nt|lml: maybe an endplay though|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|bobh1: yes sometimes passing all the time works well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: so on this line lead @CQ likely ducked,  Heart to hand club|pg||
nt|lml: but it seems a bit messy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be over fast|pg||
nt|bobh1: its just not as much fun|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: NS upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lml: well the OR missed the grand|pg||
nt|lml: he cant really travel back and forth|pg||
nt|lml: well lets see if it works|pg||
nt|kareno: (_)?   Tea for me - I'm pouring - and cookies for all except Roland :)  OOOOO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: If anyone has any idea of how to get caps lock off on a tiny little laptop; let me know!|pg||
nt|kareno: Have you tried hitting the caps key again?  Shift?|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: Senior points down|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jtr: wow 4@s!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: both pairs play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|dburn: I am not sure about that - Hamman and Zia play five-card majors, I think|pg||
nt|delberto:  3C is quite aggressive...or am I gettng old :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@C bid highlighted the likely values and helped the decision|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c is standard operating procedure for West, who doesn't quite have enough for 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: perhaps they play 5 card majors, that might be true, sorry for the misinformation|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is a typical punt in east's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: Zia is in the tank|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he has potentially a great hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jtr: @hK not Q in North would make 6 playable|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not great enough!|pg||
nt|jtr: Just about|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|panosk: slight 1 :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsu: Zia reads the daily bulletin while the rest of the players sit motionless|pg||

nt|lml: so many reasons for no|pg||
nt|stc: For the specs, 7NT makes on a sqz @S/@H on N, dd of course|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming he gets a club lead, he has a double squeeze|pg||
nt|yuval10: right|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it seem as if @h lead from S will defeat 7NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  and that is not double dummy|pg||
nt|stc: If E play, the @H lead beats|pg||
nt|henryb:  how on earth would East become the declarer?|pg||
nt|yuval10: many kibitzers argue that 1@s is better to open from E's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d sry|pg||
nt|stc: of course all this is hypothetical, they will play in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
nt|dburn: would not mind it if playing a method where 2@d was a bad weak two, and 2@s constructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: LTC says N does not have a raise to the 3 level, but it is hard to resist with those trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will bid Diamonds|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
nt|lml: excdept for the four card heart suit... it always burns me|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you play that way, you can often show 6-4 in the majors in response to an inquiry|pg||
nt|lml: headed for 3NT I suppose|pg||
nt|stc: OR opened 1@d which, on this hand at least, is much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's quite tough now for Nickell|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course he'll never pass, but it's not easy for them to understand they need to agree over @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be interesting to find out if Martel was going to invite over 1@S-P|pg||
nt|mamos: ther eshould not be a danger of overbidding here with two Black Aces missing  but you never know ..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @d better|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@c is a very aggressive intervention. But as u c N advancing, he is expecting that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c might very well be interpret as agreeing @s, as many kibz suggested|pg||
nt|henryb:  Two suiters are often easier when you open one of the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
mb|6D|nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Ax is not such a great stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  I tink West will raise to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps 7NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
mb|7D|nt|lml: yes it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: helpful lead as it happens|pg||
nt|panosk: it seems we have a clear winner here|pg||
nt|panosk: gd performance by |pg||
nt|marlowepi: al;most surely he would bid 2S over pass, especially NV|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..and i think almost everyone would bid 3S in the actual auction...too dangerous to withhold support and values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: Zaleski team and congratulations|pg||
nt|yuval10: no, appearently he got it right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So a struggle here, but a quick play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz:  "thats all"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: Well done in both rooms!|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
mc|13|nt|marlowepi: W loved the opening lead|pg||

nt|riccho: this hand is an example for that|pg||
nt|riccho: last hand... |pg||
nt|lml: they should get to slam on this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: director again warning about time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this week i've seen most variations of Ghestem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good minor shapes for D here but stiff heart is worrisome|pg||
nt|lml: anybody in this field who misses it will be embarrassed|pg||
nt|riccho: 6@s is a must for a serious partnership here, or?|pg||
mb|2H|an|3 cd limit raise|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@h pass or correct as before.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: what should West do now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: this is another hadn where all participants will get their money's worth in the auction...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those variations about the same....yyour Ghestem's as good as mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I do not promise I get all the spots right every hand, but he did not play KH|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he's gone for Pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass is expected by west.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good lead by Balicki.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: haven't noticed that bridge players "do" embarassment|pg||
nt|dburn: 7 IMPs to Fleischer came on board 5, where delcarer in this room took a seriously wrong (but entirely reasonable) view of the club suit in 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: thx April...normally in that situation after a finesse one plays the card one is known to hold|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT strong spade raise, 3@h natural, 3@s waiting - no shortage - 4@d short diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: this one should be a quick one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
nt|mamos: Club position is crucial to the number of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a minimum -3 for 800.  Another good pickup for Cayne.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you haven't worked as vugraph operator you should know that the ABSOLUTE toughest part of the job is play of the hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||

nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h improvisation - "last train" not actually part of the methods|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club shift needed so club doesn't go away.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
nt|dburn: Blackwood, one key card...|pg||
nt|riccho: looks like you know NS very well... :)|pg||
nt|lml: so far one pair has missed the slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ...stumbling towards Blackwood|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many players never let you see their cards, most just give you a glimpse|pg||

pc|s7|nt|dburn: which was once too often for Malinowski - we missed a game, and he vowed never to play with me again|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: 2@H is weak and 2NT is asking|pg||

nt|henryb:  I think you have a pointed suit squeeze|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panosk: most probably |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually had a bid to describe exactly 5@D & 4@C  but  those @C .... yuk|pg||

nt|tejjyid: OK, a who's who of Flannery players is being delivered to me|pg||

nt|mamos: North had a good hand for 2@C so is now probably worrying about going on|pg||
nt|riccho: the best with flannery is, that you cannot play another stupid 2level opening obstruction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether they have a clear agreement on 2NT here|pg||
nt|lml: well it probably made the north south auction tougher here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 3@d showed 2 top hearts|pg||

nt|riccho: aggressive|pg||
nt|henryb:  you lose a spade, win the club, cross ruff majors and cash the @cQ which squeezes West|pg||
nt|yuval10: only now Nickell "woke up" , a tad too late|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: I don't like it either but it was effective here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West passed in first seat and East may be light in third - double is normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S just too much with those red slowballs|pg||

nt|lml: that should cheer up north-south|pg||
nt|lml: staring at it will not help Versace|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Versace is thinking hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact S might bid 4S over 3S with his actual hand, so even 3S seems ambitious, especially NV. curious that N would be so ambitious here in a set where NS have heretofore shown ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consistent prudence in regard to NV games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room where Zagorin overcalled 1@S and Bathurst bid 2@S in comp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it certainly is!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question from spec:  was @D8 signal for @H?         very possible - or reverse count with 5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pg||

nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|hedyg: "how could he underlead the ace????"|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since South could be pretty strong - that's the thing about Flannery: a hand that would bid 1NT over 1@h cannot so easily bid 2NT over 2@d|pg||

nt|lml: VanCleef took advantage of the auction.  West showed good hearts but not a MAX|pg||
nt|lml: so East (or South) is quite likely to hold the @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff You make me 10 years older that you didnt play the 9 first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Nystrom-Bertheau have been on a World Champ team -- but they've certainly represented their country a number of times in international competition|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bobh1: a slam is available on this one|pg||
nt|lml: Qxxx of trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: keycard tells you that the trump queen is not there |pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it's about 54%...plus whatever edge declarer can find by card-reading|pg||
nt|lml: apparently it was alerted as a MAX.  I am just reading the card|pg||
nt|lml: which is in teeny print even at 125%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in 3rd seat -- Martel-Stansby don't cheat on the Weak NT openers|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose chip will venture a light passed hand t/o X?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprised Lew did not open in 3rd seat at these colours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his only choice was 1N --- or 1@D then pass all responses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the latter is what i had in mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly Marshall -- i didn't think about 1@D until i started typing :)|pg||
nt|riccho: david 1NT = 12-14?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: It looks over 50% to me played by north.  Shrug.|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 1NT is strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: anyway a great lead|pg||
nt|kareno: That redouble could show the high honor in hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer to use it with ace or king only however.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D asks about RDBL - Z says 9-10-11 then says something about 3 @hs, but I donàt know if it was shows or denies|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: Now heàs said some more about how many @hs he expects, but I still canàt tell whether less than 3 or 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: D asks about ten - interior sequence or shortness|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|bobh1: if they knew the score they would want to have bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slightly surprising E sold to 2S|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|bobh1: they probably are not aware of how far behind they are|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the 2H cue by S, the chance of driving NS a level higher are not bad, despite them being 2 passed hands|pg||
nt|chessmaste: For any spectators still awake at this table this has no chance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tlc: this hand illustrates the down side to a nebulous 1D...it's hard for partner to compete when he would otherwise|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: we should see some imps coming in for Auken soon|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzsk: rewoke|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it would be altogether ridiculous to open the South hand a strong no trump, but South is not the sort of player who goes in for that sort of thing|pg||
nt|lml: needed the club through|pg||
nt|lml: she can now either play a spade or play the top diamond and then a spade|pg||
nt|lml: int the latter case Marteil will be endplayed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile both minors may be viable at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like if the redouble does show a high honor, then heart lead would be good with that west hand - you give up a trick but get four quickly after that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z smiling, joking with D - guess he liked the result of his club switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I donàt think the RDBL showed a heart honor, just values|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can understand them putting much thinking in the boards, it's a world championship after all, but that's really way too much|pg||

nt|marlowepi: true, but there is almost surely a three level fit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: but i think all of the hand types for 4th seat 1@D mean there is either a minor fit OR partner has BAL 15-16|pg||

nt|kareno: So far Cayne pitching a shutout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: okay off the schneider... thanks guys|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: today's matches are 56 boards in four stanzas|pg||
nt|dburn: weak 2@d available if South elects to use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: strong club with symmetric relay system here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS but i doubt anybody can get there...|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs looks a likely partscore for n/s.  |pg||
nt|mamos: for me 2@C would be Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, only 56.  In our US events we start (and end) with 64 board matches.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would be bidding 3@c to play.  2@c would be stayman for me too.|pg||
nt|mamos: roland told me 56  so ...... I believe him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: really do not like that call|pg||
nt|dburn: but now it gets a bit ugly, because North's 2@h is (as I recall) not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: It doesnt help Martel to split on the previous round.  South wins and playes a spade and Martel is endplayed in the blacks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzsv: 2D does not promise diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: W gambles that E has a few|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: tesla has interesting hand pattern so i believe he'll ask several relays and settle in game when he finds out nothing awesome at west's hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am told it is 18-19 BAL with no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx you all know more than I do :)  not a lot of talking going on here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H now by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: We must believe Roland (or die) :)|pg||
nt|riccho: Here u can see the advantage of a flannery opening... :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: presumably this is transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s transfer I imagine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow he bid it!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that on this sequence by W, E will know that W has diamond length|pg||
nt|lml: North is very strong for 2@H if it is not forcing ... I know he has a diamond void but|pg||
nt|riccho: S agrees with your statement here david|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he must have seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If this is the route to 5@D I like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a lucky make next door|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have bid anyway, since she has an above-average hand for hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice 9 count with Hx in @H - worth a try|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if Nystrom didn't like @D - he could bid 3-card major with zero points|pg||
nt|tlc: nystrom's dbl indicates he has passed a likely 6-7 pt hand and wants to let his partner in on the secret..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has passed 1D but now shown some values, so he was willing to play diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: Makes 3 or 4 depending heart guess.  More tea anyone?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 56 is a long day for the WBF - Bermuda Bowl & Olympiad are 48 board days (3 16s). I think that here the later rounds (donàt know what that means though 'R8 or semi) will be 60.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: Zia in S didn't open his hand next door|pg||
nt|dburn: East might have reopened this, but he is probably too tired|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that à I canàt find the apostrophe|pg||
nt|lml: she might but I think a pass can be forgiven|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think she was (rightly) ashamed of it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: yes commentating is a tough job........|pg||
nt|hedyg: what they dont wont do to prove us wrong..|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Natural lead. Not sure what the doubled asked for in the other room|pg||
nt|tlc: with some good guessing this may come home...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzsv: i understand both tables got there.|pg||
nt|dburn: but of the 150 conventions in the world worse than Flannery, non-forcing responses to weak two bids are a very long way up the list|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri: east knows west's hand pattern but i believe he's restricted to 8-11 from 1@s initial response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be a heart as we see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these guesses should be indicated|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: agreed |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: N has shown a good hand|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|ahri: figured out he does not have slam unless west has absolutely perfect hand (AAK) which might be restricted anyway.|pg||
nt|ahri: restricted as in "bid differently" :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Cayne has now taken the lead in his group|pg||
nt|riccho: I think its worth a post mortem discussion if u get in 2@h with 25 combined points here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is often a good holding for notrump. It's a "certain" stopper with LHO on lead if he has the ace and if his partner has it, South must still find the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not here because he had an attractive alternative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS  have no effective options that i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and we get to see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|tlc: ducking the heart was their best chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, nf bids are good|pg||

nt|riccho: at least here 3NT is a fine contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ho hum   another 1570 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you have a weird little computer there!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's true, but if you ant to move toward game you can start with 2NT |pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: they may have to rethink this 2@d convention|pg||
nt|lml: www.bridgeblogging.com .. spelling error|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: This is GROUP C|pg||
nt|lml: so Shenking is showing hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: exactly 5H and 4 or more in a minor|pg||
nt|lml: there was one other pair in 2@H so far and one in 6|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: sure you can, but then no one knows whether you are bidding suits or stoppers or anything|pg||
mb|d|an|0-1 controls|nt|marlowepi: aggressive 2N bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no kidding!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not too hard to design a method that handles that|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his black suits in|pg||
nt|yuval10: another 2@c with 2-suiter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bobh1: if u lose the preemptive effect of the way other pairs use 2@d and things like this can also happen...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this is one of the exceptional hands with which S should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boring after his recent 5206 |pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I'm sure that on balance there isn't much between the approaches|pg||
nt|lml: with 5-5 that does seem like the right approach although his suits are a bit ratty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: well this is what you get for X with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what the double is about but it may help to get to the slam|pg||
nt|lml: which of course fails|pg||
nt|lml: I am still trying to understand the double.  Maybe he though he was too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a couple of other suits to consider besides spades...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: announced as halftime... noted that these guys are quite ahead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I didnàt see an alert, but often people donàt alert forcing NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so pick one that suits your ... temperament|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had a choice of cuebids -- 2@h is probably natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Another strong result for Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahri: very.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s not enough, 4@s too final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW may never get in here|pg||
nt|ahri: 4@s should fail too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|tlc: spade cards arent going to excite lew much, altho 11-12 hcp (using the new math) is|pg||
nt|lml: will south sell?|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now if will likely prevent EW of playing their excellent 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yep|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahri: i like how bidding is completely different from other room. minors in action here, majors there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a cheap save vs 4@H (if they find it, but 5@D is also on|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that might happen|pg||
nt|tlc: 4s here should do the trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess it isn't forcing.  Good contract.  More tea :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahri: 4@h can be set by two diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find 4H dubious. even if pd has 3 hearts, 5D could easily prove a much better game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby just completing his shape with 4@H  -- well 5@H 6+@D|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Stanicic should have bid 3@H instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not overcall 1@H, so 3@H shows a diamond fit too|pg||
nt|ahri: and almost surely 4 cards.|pg||
nt|ahri: or 5 very bad ones|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria should have considered that Versace thought he had clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: not that the road to 6@h is so easy after 1@s opening by W....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahri: quite gentle auction here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 5@C?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: Z: it doesn't look nice, D not going down|pg||
nt|lml: I think Fleischer likely has a pickup on board 10 too|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|lml: it is possible that the @CJ would be onside short|pg||

nt|lml: throwing the last club is probably best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: but     seems strange to ask KC holding void in suit where partner probably has values  and then not to do something other than 5@D over DBL|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|tlc: mb lew should have passed..if chip had the club ace he could XX...then lew would know to sign off..otherwise,,bid the slam|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: there it goes|pg||
nt|lml: we are slowly ... going 2 down|pg||

nt|riccho: chagas - levy "avoided" the 6@s slam in Bd7|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West might barely just have bashed something - 1@c (3@c) pass (4@c) would have left Polish bidders in the same boat as natural bidders|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzsv: remarks along the lines of interesting hand at the table...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very possible 2 different interpretations of 4@H -- hope April gets the lowdown|pg||
nt|tlc: if lew thot it was a cue bid, then the spade ace was missing..very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Not allowed to ask.  the heart bid was not alerted|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: does martel squeak|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahri: another chance for a swing to slovakia, 4@h should make|pg||
nt|ahri: for non-europeans, 17:15 is in 25 minutes :)|pg||
nt|ahri: 1@d not promising diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: as warned earlier the running scores site is very slow right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: be patient and you will get in eventually|pg||
nt|lml: try either www.bridgeblogging.com or www.bridgewinners.com|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, finals start at 15:00|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a European and it is 16:15 for me :)|pg||
nt|ahri: sorry to english people.|pg||
nt|ahri: and other timezone people! 17:15 CET is in 25 minutes :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think passing 2@S on the previous board is a mistake for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: could and probably should have been more interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: but East-West at the other table had a free run, given which missing slam was on the criminal side|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: B asks C if his pass denied 3 @hs and he shakes his head|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@s is forcing then i wonder what 3@h would be over 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: it would have been [a] forcing and [b] a better idea than 4@h, which should be the same hand without @dA|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so Martel's tactical 1@H bought the hand for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well I dont wish either team to do poorly.  I am a big fan of Lavazza but go Canucks|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians seem to lack their customary energy in this match|pg||
nt|lml: no matter they will be in this event for a long time|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess they're just relaxing at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: they will turn up the heat in a day or two|pg||
nt|bobh1: a lot of bidding in this room|pg||
nt|bobh1: once again the Canadians are exhibiting a much better approach|pg||
nt|lml: it might play well though|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think its a make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no discussion of result -- the orginal Blue Team taught us that is good for partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2NT by N would have been stronger then 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I had a good time once trying to type something serious on a French keyboard.  Yikes!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Another one-suited takeout double :)  I imagine north will support hearts.|pg||
nt|lml: they may make a few on the good splits|pg||
nt|dburn: well, so would pass have done, but he has improved the contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahri: chance for down three and an imp for slovakia|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem as if NS has 5 losers in 2@h|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, who jumped to 4@h after his partner's overcall, described that as "doing a Meckstroth"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahri: so it will be 27 or 28 lead on halftime|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Handsome lead going into the last 12 boards|pg||
nt|ahri: ops, two imps :)|pg||
nt|lml: the hearts can set up|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: tactical, or systemic?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobh1: the auction in the other room was very weak imo|pg||
nt|lml: the momentum has really swung around in this match, amazing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: With diamonds friendly and the spade guess pretty clear, this can make 4.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobh1: the S hand is too good for a weak jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: McAvoy sorry if this is wrong I have no HCPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but you have distro out the kazoo|pg||
nt|lml: its always good to apologize when you think you are making it|pg||
nt|lml: I never apologize when I think we are going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: much better than being confident and going down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it might be very close now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin, wow, nice hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: and Senior asked whether Meckstroth had ever done a Zia|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: he's max HCP -- wonder how much stronger the hand can get  [just kidding  @SQx dubious value]|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: North might have thought about doubling 1@H I suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 2@c bid by E since the double by W is usually mainly for majors and could have a doubleton @C|pg||
nt|lml: but his hearts are a bit ragged|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores are back|pg||
nt|kareno: But not a game to bid even vul, I would say.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: Belgians on a role +1 on successive boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you don't think S would have balanced over 1@D-P-P?|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|mc|8|nt|ahri: a push, so this is the halftime score|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Zia always tells me that you should respond on bad hands if you think the opponents might make 3NT, but not if you don't|pg||
nt|lml: Martel had every reason to believe they could make it|pg||
nt|lml: so he was following the ZIa rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you should follow Zia's advice when it is correct too David, but not otherwise|pg||

nt|marlowepi: am wondering what the balance sheet is on playing superaccept & weak NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should get to slkam here|pg||
nt|kareno: Misguessing spades.  Why?  I think he hopes the spade ace is with east in case they bid the game in the OR.|pg||
nt|mamos: that really didt make much sense |pg||
nt|riccho: yes its so easy to make the mistakes which partner advised to|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, on that hand he'd probably have shouted at me anyway for not raising spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, Zia is a coach? I had no idea|pg||
nt|riccho: no rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not all rubber players give lessons|pg||
nt|riccho: at rubber bridge it pays to punish partner for his mistakes|pg||
nt|riccho: you get him twice back as an opponent|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, de Botton picked up eight IMPs in bits and pieces - six for a fearless balance by Sandqvist on 9 and (remarkably) 2 when the combined 25 count was played in 2@d and not ...|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good buy|pg||
nt|lml: since four of a minor is available north south|pg||
nt|lml: bye now heading for dinner|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Auken has taken over the lead group lead|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR on the earlier hand East just bid 4@d over the heart preempt and will be surprised perhaps ito win imps|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|bobh1: this slam can be defeated|pg||
nt|lml: Rayner has moved into a tie for first in the division|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: W led the @c A|pg||
nt|lml: they cashed the @ca at trick one and it was all over|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe at mps that lead is normal|pg||
nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps?|pg||
nt|lml: so we are near a tie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S, 4@S [if Kickback],  what other options?     nope never thought about 4@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy contender for "filthy  overcall of the year" honors|pg||
nt|mamos: just lost an imp|pg||
nt|kareno: I would bid 1nt (if it is in range) with four hearts and diamonds, but not with spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether Katz could double for penalty and chose not to, or whether his double would be conventional|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussion between Katz and Allfrey|pg||
nt|dburn: but North rather than West is forced to bid 2@d on this auction|pg||
mb|2D|an|forced|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why that got alerted - just a limit raise, as far as I know|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@H surely|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a limit raise has become artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: S alerted. however N did not|pg||
nt|riccho: unusual convention |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might, but 3@h may have the feel of a pre-balance, so I guess he could pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||
nt|tlc: it has my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute treatment  ---   i was going to guess a version of Swiss with bad trump|pg||
nt|riccho: well done martel|pg||
nt|dburn: he did pass|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well done|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: leading unsupported aces is not a growth industry at imps|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: i meant|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z's DBL showed a 5 card Major and another suit at least 4 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Stoppers in both majors and hopes for the club suit.  |pg||
nt|kareno: North needed the eight of clubs this time.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'm about to designate Z as the best player to be a VG operator for - he explains things very clearly with gestures so I can figure out what he's said :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, gestures and he isn't even Italian :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: trust your opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|tlc: "last train" for any specs that might wonder means "I want to make a final slam try, but have nothing specific to say without getting past game"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be quick claim too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: typically it is an artificial use of the call just below the game level|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they were kind enough to write that one down for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you are the best Operator - you bring the room to life for us as well as following the play and explanations.  I'm always happy to see you in my room :)  Thanks again!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: he thought maybe Sementa had the stiff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: certainly is possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: The cards just won't stretch for nine tricks.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzsv: Tough hand to defend though - Z must be worried that another spade will be declarer's 9th trick, not knowing about those minor suit spots in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He can be patient about the spade.  Meanwhile, north is playing on diamonds - if clubs were solid I think he'd be going after his ninth trick in hearts.  |pg||
nt|kareno: South, that is,|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Although, if the @d6 is upside down count, either partner has those higher spots or declarer only has 3 spades (with 6 @ds)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|kareno: Great slam missed by Belgium in the OR.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z chatting - Z says "I told you at least 5 and at least 4 - had 55" All very friendly by both of them|pg||
nt|kareno: West certainly could have bid 4@c over 3@c by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rob: I made the minimum,  Katz:  min would have been if youhooked the spade nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: would be very inspired to say the least to lead a @d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: the score is now 25 VP for Rayner and only 3 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this Flannery?|pg||
nt|lml: do you like the weak 2 with four cards in the other major|pg||
nt|lml: and in second chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Zagorin-Bathurst struggled with  11     they also stalled at 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Nystrom remarked.. thinks it was their first constructive auction lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = RELAY, FG  [says nothing about @C]|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not when the other major is this good|pg||
nt|lml: no it was a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: pretty sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: well way too strong for a multi imo|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: now some people dont like bidding 1NT in that position as natural but I think it is just fine myself|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT as 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: splinter for clubs thoughg 2C was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i assume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the answers to the relays :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am told i am wrong|pg||
nt|tlc: for partnerships that play Kickback ( a version of RKC where the key card ask is the step above the trump suit) frequently have issues when one partner has both D-H and the other ...|pg||
nt|tlc: believes 4H is Kickback in  Diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am used to it:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Just as it should be - bridge at the highest levels is still a game of gentlemen.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone know the WBF site to follow all the matches?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and ladies :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: so finally the last board of this quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: swangames has running scores|pg||
nt|mamos: hang on I'll find addy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from 1@H-2@C   i think 3@D says  5-7 zz points [A3 K2 Q1] with short @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not HCP   zz points [aka AKQ points]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: he did write down 3 - 2 - 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Bertheau has 8   A[3] A[3] K[2]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok thanks.  someone will explain zz points to me at the bar later.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: story i've been told about "zz"    the author didn't know what to call the treatment so used filler of "zz" -- too many people had read draft before official name could be given, ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so zz stuck|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: Van Cleeff was one of the authors of a book called the Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|lml: apparently someone says they shows both majors 6-11.  He doesnt have that either really|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as multi.  |pg||
nt|lml: now if it show 6/4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty April!|pg||
nt|lml: yes I thought it was that... he loves multi and Mudienberg 2's which came up earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: your welcome. |pg||
nt|lml: April is the best|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose when the smoke clears they will land in the reasoanable 6Cs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next session in 55 minutes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: i prefer sandwich but most good players agree with you|pg||
nt|kareno: Try http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|riccho: last bd here for this session|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is natural but unlimited - difficult call for North here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is the auction GF yet?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s was in theory forcing to game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: presumably it is, so 3@C looks OK|pg||
nt|riccho: sandqvist followed the zia rules and bid not only 1@h but raised to 2@s (Bd12) -1 |pg||
nt|riccho: -1 after partner bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia is allowed to pass 1@s if partner will be declarer in four, but partner is not allowed to pass if Zia will be declarer in four|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||
nt|bobh1: when both of the opps have bid, if feel like a sitting duck bidding 1N with this hand|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, probably 6C. E will lay down club ace. then NS can both get style points for playing the jack and queen :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only thing known about West hand [without peeking] is that he is Game Force, but not @S fit with shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think this system is designed for E to need to know anything about W hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "pragmatic" 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner needs very right cards for 6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: An accurate route to the excellent slam is found by B/K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z, laughing, "invitation"|pg||
nt|mamos: It's difficult to see much future in this match for the Belgians  --  really great  start for Cayne|pg||
nt|kareno: Last board of the set.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of great bridge to come.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now, Z has asked B to show him his hand, so he can claim. Then says something about smoking :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||
nt|lml: I never though of that before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 5@C encouraging|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry, I am not familiar with the system. We are doing the best we can.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice contract -- whatever the auction meant|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: I have an auction with explanations from a spec:  the explanations are wrong: 1@C polish, 1@S 7+ 4+@S, 2@D 3+@S GF 2@H 7-9(10) exactly 4@S 4@D splinter etc|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: they need to take their club trick .. yep|pg||
nt|tlc: another "black box" auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: April -- the only thing to apologize for is   apologizing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably natural bidders would get there also|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: I saw a match yesterday where one side was preempted out of the auction when they had 26 HCP|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: ty to Jan for enhancing our enjoyment  ad to all specs for joining us|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: And to you Mike :)|pg||
nt|kareno: This was a great display of bridge expertise at the top level by the great Polish pair e/w|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I think there is a break before the next segment, but I don't know for sure - I wasn't supposed to be doing this, so don't have a lot of information :). The BBO Vugraph schedule ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: page should show the time for the next segment to start|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: I see 8 tricks the ninth is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: might have tried for Kx in @s in E and a @s/@d squeeze on W?|pg||
pc|hT|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: Marshall   do you think Fleisher will open 1@S or 1@C?|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye all|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx Joe our operator in Phili!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks all --  back in 52 minutes|pg||
pg||
