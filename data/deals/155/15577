nt|toral5: is it like murray-kehela natural?means natural system with ONLY 100 modifications.lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: EW traditional polish club when vulnerable, agressive strong club not vul|pg||
nt|jkotor: prec style 2@c 11-14, 5+ unbal|pg||
nt|toral5: here we go|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|swanson: 5@H is a good save for N-S here but with some defense in each hand and no shortness, E-W will probably buy it for 4@S.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = nF by 90% of Polish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like west found a gr8 @D lead to beat 3@S in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and some more thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: as u see 4 card opening in major by the norwegian pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looking at the cards now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still no sign of making a bid|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|toral5: difficult for north to resist with tht hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: correction: only 4 card in @h and 5 in @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: if only 5@c West will have a 4-card major|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Martens did the right thing|pg||
nt|jkotor: yup, with 4@d-5@c -> 1@d, unless they play different than others|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we are starting with board 16 and playing 14 boards this session|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 losers in this game.so we begin with a push|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: killing @D lead:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably wandering how not to loose a trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|toral5: in 1 way helness wd be hapy to see @H 9/10 at trick 1.|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: EW will want thirteen more like this one, please|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: lots of confused looks around the table|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond lead will set 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S playimng strong club or natiural club opening with that distribution|pg||
nt|barnets: when east ducks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: but a club lead|pg||
nt|barnets: sets up a discard|pg||

nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
mb|4D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jkotor: i think he is winning in the different boards|pg||
nt|pelu: carefull unblocing @DA|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time now|pg||
nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: Would the 9 or 10 be led for 10-9 doubleton, Jakub?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|swanson: from|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lestergold: no excitement here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n 4@h both throw against the wall|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec has a problem in 4@H on a club lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he cant see the @Ck is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the spades and dims neither breaking true|pg||
nt|barnets: He may rise and try and discard his club loser|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: surely would not risk the low percentage club finesse and lead found you must be psychic |pg||
nt|barnets: West will ruff with an honour and all will be ok|pg||
nt|barnets: dec will pitch his 2 clubs aand lose just 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice lead though|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit tho that 3N looks like the more elgant contract always cold|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: lead came instantly|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d7|pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-SÃ¦lensminde|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||

nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
pc|hK|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|swanson: And this is now down two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta:  it is too fast :(|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||

nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|pelu: for sure he will win - but if @s-finess lose then 9 red winners for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Zia says oh, it is one of those|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 28 EW are not vulnerable - so if Meckstroth-Rodwell bid game, it is only 6 imps|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: wow -that would do |pg||
nt|odysseus69: stupidly I said "all over" and immediately the roof fell in for Martens|pg||
nt|jkotor: or rather Polish/Czech team gave it away|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzta: cards are being tossed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: salad should be tossed. Cards should be played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia says what are you doing to me guys?|pg||
nt|swanson: It is amazing how often this type of situation happens - you have to play hard until they director refuses to give you any more hands to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: according to north and south, Zia has taken all of the tricks, but Zia just asks if he has 5 tricks andamman confirms :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get this right - low from doubleton on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked about the lead and was told that his opponents lead low from doubletons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2nd/4th against suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I think it is low from a singleton, but I might be wrong on that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is playing a diamond through Jassem|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@h other room, may be very important guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem ruffs with the king of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently they are in 2@H next door|pg||
nt|toral5: zimmerman did bid and make 6c for an 11 imp pik up|pg||
nt|pelu: new keyboard, pl, :):)|pg||
nt|kittyc: I really dislike the 1NT opener with such a suit oriented hand but almost all the players did it so what do I know|pg||
nt|toral5: and he got a @Slead in to AJ:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: He got a spadelead, and had no loosing option in play either|pg||
nt|kittyc: playing BART it is less necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking what card to play|pg||
nt|pelu: NS told him that @SQ was in S - S X a 3@S-bid - so easy win|pg||
