nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ala should get a lot of practice hitting the Alert key|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-16 HCP, 2+@D, usually not 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: Sabine and Danny play four card majors so 1@D denies 4|pg||
nt|lml: they will canape with a longer minor|pg||
nt|dinos1: plus strong club|pg||
nt|lml: which is more or less what you said to Al|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

nt|lml: hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi linda|pg||
nt|bobh1: april|pg||
nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|henryb:  A Roland 20-20|pg||
nt|yuval10: Meckwell is having their rest at first session, as usual|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I cannot add: 21-19|pg||
nt|stc: What do we know about NS methoids ? Acol ? Weak NT ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a dull 3N to start with|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Marshall!!!  welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think I would bid 2@H now with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: an exciting deal to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi April:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: NS-- strong NT, dia, hearts, and spades promise 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: club could be 1 if 4X1|pg||
nt|henryb:  East should be grateful that he was not left in 1@hXX|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: E/W play a baltic @C system, it's similar to a polish @C system|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|mamos: all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: welcome to this round of 64 match|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: hi April|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||
nt|lml: no but I think North should be|pg||
nt|lml: the points are very soft and he has shown about this much|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a lot of cards altho they may not be useful ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: quick note, I can only see one side of the table when screens are down so bids will be delayed until the board comes back.|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N will bid again because its imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hargreaves sementa|pg||
nt|milton_se: Eight tricks seem easy -- and there is the ninth|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby play a weak NT except 3rd seat VUL   but rarely open 1N with this shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: @H@H@H@H|pg||
nt|400 volt: First Board an interesting 3 NT, a major lead by north would make it difficult|pg||
nt|400 volt: but after @D A at least 9 tricks are there. I expect now 4@S, 2@H, 3@D, 1@C for +1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3NT played by east would be chanceless with a @C lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I dont have that yet. |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: as often happens in these cases when partner is broke, the 2 level is way too high|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|mamos: a fairly quiet start while we all get settled down|pg||
nt|stc: now @c|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: this contract is very tight.  |pg||
nt|lml: it might make if east can be enplayed somehow|pg||
nt|lml: cash the @HQ and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|nt|stc: ducking was better|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|oliverc: now ok|pg||
nt|400 volt: Alexander Smirnov is very young for his skill level. He is 28 years old as far as I know. So I expect you will often hear his name in the future, too. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panosk: 9 cl droping makes the contract safe|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|400 volt: I was just told that the North player is even younger with 23 years and has won several national championships, too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: seems to be a trick short|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  now one trump and a @d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stc: now @d and big trouble|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: yes I dont see a way to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: still a decent gain for Zaleski|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|10|pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SAJT97HA96DA986CQ,S82HQJ53DKJT74C74,SK63HKT82D53C8632,SQ54H74DQ2CAKJT95|sv|n|nt|lml: In fact I see two have already so it is a possible swing either way|pg||
nt|lml: 6 have now all making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might DBL instead of overcall 1@H  -- that discussion has been ongoing since takeout doubles were invented|pg||
mb|2C|an|5+ club w-ith M or 6+ clubs|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: so Vito starts out with a "soft" result|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3N is makeable if guess N's shape - cash top majors and play @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other partnerships  Karaivanov has played something that looks like Polish Club|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C opening certainly fits that possibility with Rusev|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Polish Club uses the original Precision 2@C  of 6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a limited opening hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: 4@S is a bit aggressive on these cards|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: ahhh    lead SMALL from worthless doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@s is more aggressive :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I meant the contract :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think both N and S took pushy bids|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is touch and go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but that's their style|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dinos1: now has to rufff high|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think this will end up one down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it won't go down quickly|pg||
nt|dinos1: then make on @d endplay - d/dummy though|pg||
nt|lml: there might be a squeeze here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too likely to play for split @H honors|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d - @sK, @s fin, @h to J and K, @s fin ...|pg||
nt|lml: yes maybe an endplay if Arnin does guess the heart position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Rusev can open 1N with 6@C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's really dbl dummy|pg||
nt|dinos1: or - play @h to fin @h - same|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even if she take that line, when W returns a @H honour she has to guess the ending|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems she'll do it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: powerful options holding @H1098|pg||
nt|lml: she really has to guess the heart position I agree.  West is not likely to split.|pg||
nt|lml: and the diamond position too|pg||
nt|dinos1: so - @h to J and K, fin @s, @d ruff high, @s fin, @s A - @d endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Dani is a very good and very thoughtfuyl declarer, however|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I've seen her make hands like this in the past|pg||
nt|lml: she is awesome |pg||
nt|lml: I agree.|pg||
nt|lml: I would put money on her but I want some odds|pg||
nt|dinos1: so after all - not d/dummy :)|pg||
nt|lml: so far all of the pairs in 4@s have gone down.  So this is a real test|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: dbl dummy in the sense you have to ;place every card exactly right|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: playing for 3-3 diamonds bascially|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: her problem was that the other lines required a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or East to hold singleton @HQ or J|pg||
nt|lml: this one required less|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or the long spade hand to have 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that would mean @D 33 or  East @SQx instead of @SQxx|pg||
nt|lml: that isn't good enough without some more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry ray -- you typed faster|pg||
nt|lml: the long spade hand thing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lml: what she did is very reasonable.  |pg||
nt|lml: sensible line just wrong|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I was going to give you 2-1|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dinos1: now endplay|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|dinos1: for -1|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: she lost count there|pg||
nt|dinos1: no|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: she knows east has a club|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAJT97HA96DA986CQ,S82HQJ53DKJT74C74,SK63HKT82D53C8632,SQ54H74DQ2CAKJT95|sv|n|nt|panosk: N-S make 3nt here but lets see|pg||
nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: these guys are fast players.. <i will try to keep up|pg||
nt|yuval10: he prably cashed 8@s as well|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: west in the oR responded 2@C and went onto 3@C which looks over optimistic|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC for EW from 2010 European Championship online at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
nt|lml: good morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: good morning|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N or 2N by East?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
nt|riccho: hi everybody|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: hi April.  Good to work with you again|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karen Allison|pg||
nt|400 volt: the 1@C opening is either natural 12+, balanced 12-14 or an 18+ count|pg||
mb|3S|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive opening here from Martel|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what methods East-West use, but these are likely to get them to a hopeless game fairly quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can see   2@C neither promises a 4-card major  nor  points :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in days of yore when one picked up a hand like N has one could expect to open the bidding. nowadays one is lucky to be able to open if one holds it in second seat. 4th chair? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fuhgedaboutit|pg||
nt|mamos: ndo???|pg||
nt|mamos: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas ... Roland :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello Karen|pg||
nt|henryb:  I approve|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|tlc: may i join the fun?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jim -- you want to psyche or DBL???|pg||
nt|stc: conservative bid by katz, but well judged|pg||
nt|yuval10: no spots and very soft points, so E downgraded|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner could not open 1N, and will bid again with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: unfortunately for him it looks as if 3NT has a play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sry, got distracted on last handò dec led a second heart, which Katz ducked....|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: the K @s is suspect but you never know|pg||
nt|riccho: I´m not able to imagine an american pair playing sth different from WK2 opening|pg||
nt|dburn: however, hopeless is as hopeless does - if declarer plays a secodn trump, South needs to cash out|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: Is this the real auction?|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction is out of sync but I think we can see what is happening  1@h from South f 1NT from North|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT I guess coming|pg||
nt|kareno: I get it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And it's an easy 3nt.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: when I played 10-12 NT  i would try 2N as West -- but that was natural invite back then|pg||
nt|stc: now 3NT has a lot of play !|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: and not do anything heroic like underleading @hA|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3@S is a good contract. After the dbl of Alexander Smirnov south should be able to make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tlc: seems on this auction that stansby might try 3nt w/ many more HCP than he might have|pg||
pc|c7|nt|riccho: but with the red aces this shouldnt be a big problem|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s tricks and 2 in each other|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: everyone is asking me about the running scores... go to www.bridgeblogging.com and click on the link|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think this will work out well for Auken though|pg||
nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: If clubs can be only 3 long, that is a quirky bid.  I don't know their system, however.|pg||
nt|mamos: so for ayone confused by the auction we think South opened 1@H North responded 1NT and South bid 2@C  Im not sure why North thought 5@C was right|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some specs are already asking for the link to the running standings.  please publish if you have it.  thanks!|pg||
nt|milton_se: the question is: does West have both H honours or just one?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|lml: 98 is a huge score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that....however, he might transfer and bid 3N, though action is doubtful, since that would at least give him two ways to win|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know. a spade back and a club|pg||
nt|lml: ruff ruff and a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: You can go to either www.bridgeblogging.com and push the button at the top or go to www.bridgwinners.com|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Apteker-Wolfson match, both tables landed in 3NT here|pg||
nt|stc: 2@c in OR looks like ab accident|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tlc: agreed..aassuming they have that agreement on this auction(probably yes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stansby understandably went low because they probably intervene aggressively against these EW methods|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|milton_se: now obvious|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: they both point to the same place|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: Luckily for declarer, clubs and hearts are friendly and it will fetch.  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Wonder if eas |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: we have the first medium swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: or a very weird decision by W to leave 2@c|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: no surprise  Bathurst-Zagorin had a free run to get to 4@H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if my opponents wanted to play 4H with Jxxxx facing AK, i would not want to disrupt their auction either:):)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the kindest thing that could be said is that 5@C was lucky|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  Drury not remembered, probably|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: that would have worked linda but W didnt try for it|pg||
nt|kareno: Wonder if east will block the clubs and beat this.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|sK|nt|lml: no it might be too hard to work out|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|stc: very likely :)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: so dbl or 2@S as North now?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: I do|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a house divided :)|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I would on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: its the high card points not the shape|pg||
nt|dinos1: depends on style of your overclling|pg||
nt|lml: she does have a great hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I know partner doesn't have much, and I want to keep hearts in the picture|pg||
nt|lml: is this worth another bid?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: I think 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that will get them to 3@S|pg||

nt|mamos: it seemed that North had little idea what South's shape was so East was a little unlikely to know either|pg||
nt|dburn: duly accomplished in jig time - having spent this afternoon watching Weichsel, Feldman, Sadek and El-Almahdy, I must say that it is refershing to see bridge being played at normal ...|pg||
nt|dburn: tempo|pg||
nt|riccho: rofl|pg||
nt|stc: to beat 3NT S must lead a @cH and switch to a @h when ducked, not easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c seem like a good sacrifice for NS, but other room didn't find it, though they bided and supported the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: the only advantage is than, that you get the results from the other table|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one way or another board 2 will be a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S, usually not 10 HCP & 5332|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, strong no trump, nothing much else special for North-South|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
nt|400 volt: the first board gave 7 IMPs to JOSEF and CARDS|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table ended in 1 NT|pg||
nt|400 volt: making one trick less|pg||
mb|1H|nt|stc: very good sac in 5@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's some X by North with very minimal values|pg||
nt|stc: 9 or even 10 tricks in @c contract|pg||
nt|400 volt: sry, 1NT+1, so 2 tricks less than this table :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Nystrom-Bertheau  almost all hands with 16+ HCP start with 1@C [some 16 have options]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned double from N...some would bid 2H as that is the most likely place for game. but here Martel is not willing to bid 2H then back in with douyble, so he preferes to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: show the polyvalent nature of the hand immediately|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if any other vugraph session has seen/heard the use of 'polyvalent'|pg||
nt|400 volt: Sabine Auken lead a much more successfull spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|400 volt: again 3@S by N/S is the best contract|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tlc: sounds very chemical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vocabulary quiz at end of set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S torn between H and NT, H will win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Martel's action was a Forcing Pass situation -- where 2@H weaker than PASS then bid|pg||
nt|kareno: That double announces a penalty pass over 1@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  But if S bids he is more likely to bid 5@h, which will be very costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think|pg||
nt|stc: why not 4NT and 5@h on 5@d ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: I expect them to end there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
nt|mamos: that 1@S overcall was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|kareno: No but if you don't get your suits into the auction, you can be run over on the partscore hands.|pg||
nt|mamos: the danger on this hand seems to be of settling in 3NT|pg||
nt|milton_se: needing Hs 3-3 or the Q with East|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: X|pg||
nt|stc: and very happy on 5@c !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to guess since 1N was artificial|pg||
nt|henryb:  Because I think 4N and then 5@h should be a slam try|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll be ok with careful play, i believe|pg||
nt|stc: when a vul op bids 4@s ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes, even then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: screen down; Robson asking questions|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, torn between raising hearts and trying for NT via 2S|pg||
nt|tlc: this time the conservative view will not pay off..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and who can blame him?|pg||
nt|400 volt: you may ruff a @H in dummy|pg||
nt|400 volt: so even with @H 4-2 and the queen with west would make 3@S laydown|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all. Sorry, computer problem. Had to restart|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, missed the 4th trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n looking at conv card|pg||
nt|400 volt: 8 IMPs for the VITO team: Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim ended in 4@S last board, down 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
pc|dA|nt|riccho: I have to admit I would have doubled this|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps 5@c was the solution, N looks to have no points, good hope for a 3 suiter|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And you've exactly identified what was about to happen.  @h Q to beat it.|pg||
nt|400 volt: E/W leading 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|400 volt: (6th)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has a reasonable X, for sure|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: In OR NS knew about the @c fit but decided not to preempt, strange ?!|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the OR North knew his partner had at least three clubs. He did not know about five|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has every reason to think that the black suit strengths of the defense are massed behind those of the offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin opened Stansby's hand so they had relatively free run to 4@H  again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and it is a NV game|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: here I think the 2@D call is too much from W|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: The Cayne team have started strongly |pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb:  And S did not know his partner was that short in @s|pg||
nt|stc: If Zia x 3@c N will know better about the fit|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: another 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|lml: she was probably happy that wasnt there ... just in case they were in game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lml: I dont think you want to get too high here|pg||
nt|dinos1: now relay 2N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: IFF same card as Karaivanov-Trendafilov   2@D=weak with @H or INV but not 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lml: they are high enough now for comfort|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: diamond blockage helps declarer here, but probably not enough|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c - 6cd?|pg||
nt|caitlin: greetings|pg||
nt|lml: I think this might make actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: 3@C is 6-4 weak|pg||
nt|buffytvs: needs to guess clubs I suspect|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: there will be a club guess eventually|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: all depends on the right club view I think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so far so good, but he still doesn't really know where the ace is|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: so now it comes|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because of @S position probably hopes @CA onside|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|lml: well done|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dinos1: now S is endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: it really is a straight guess|pg||
nt|caitlin: nice swing|pg||
nt|lml: unless you are very tall|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dinos1: 5@c+2@h+1@d is only 8  -cdnt cash 9th trick, @dQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: disadvantage of not playing upside down attitude|pg||
nt|lml: South has to give him a trick|pg||
nt|lml: luckily has no more hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: screen down; Rusev asking ?s|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: East isn't relying on south to have no hearts.  South could have the @HQ or the @SA may be onside etc.|pg||
nt|lml: this isn't such a terrific game but it will come home|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pc|dT|nt|buffytvs: it will be a popular spot on this deal I think|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: bidding and making 3NT on these cards is a plus position.|pg||
nt|lml: you have a reasonable chance of making imps since even if they bid they may not make it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: 23 high and a 6-card suit -- pretty much auto 3NT in the modern game|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: about 4 or 5 pairs so far are in partscore|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: but a lot of the field is -500 (down 5)|pg||
mc|9|nt|buffytvs: that surprises me|pg||
pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2SA765H5D98643CA82,ST8HAJ42D2CKQ9543,SQJ9HQT976DKJTCJ6,SK432HK83DAQ75CT7|sv|b|nt|lml: so do you think anybody will miss the grand in this group?|pg||
nt|lml: yes something lingering with oil is the usual punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where our NS in partscore and other table game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he thinks it will be an 8 card fit. having said all that, LKosing Trick Count still says "stop thinking and bid a game already"|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a good score for Cayne in the OR  - not so easy to avoid this outcome I think|pg||
nt|dburn: not that Janet de Botton was expecting to be in game - she was catering for a better part score if partner happened to have three spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|stc: K@s was not good :(|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yuval10: K@s wasn't the problem, it was still -4|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: W has only 3 card support opposite a poor hand and what could be a 4 card suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: 4@S down 4 deservedly lost a bunch of imps.|pg||
nt|lml: So far it seems like the Auken team is trying too hard|pg||
nt|lml: guys just sit back and bid your cards... you are good enough|pg||
nt|riccho: yes careful bidding but partner ....|pg||
nt|yuval10: had E just discard a @s over the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it turns out that the first two recorded scores are played in 6|pg||
nt|mamos: Polish Club|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with 3 prime cards, north's optimism had a solid basis|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzsv: 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: This match is between the leaders of this group.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd time in a row  their NS went down|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @d ruff and 2 last tricks is for E with his trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@C=(a) 12-14 bal (b) 11-18, natural (c) 18/19+ any shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3rn of 4 se3ssion|pg||
nt|400 volt: 3 NT will only make if you guess right in @C|pg||
nt|400 volt: and I expect him to make it wrong after north bid 1@H and south passed, especially if @S A is known|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kareno: 1@d negative |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: another potential gain for Zaleski here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: would you have overcalled 1@S with the north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: up to 14 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: I think I might have|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: only if they bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6d are very gd spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: not easy to avoid it, IMHO|pg||
nt|mathat: 7 @d |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: Rehi all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that - I was trying to get caps lock off and got disconnected|pg||
nt|riccho: obv. no nonforcing stayman here available, so stansby had to trf in his longest suit and hope for the best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the third and fianl club....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: even beter|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzsv: Just FYI < I can only see one side of the screen.  So bids by N & E are delayed until the board comes back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect we'll finally see same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, alerts are only from the W S discussions|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
nt|panosk: they ll stop at 6 i think lets see if he makes 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got too much to never do anything|pg||
nt|lml: After making a grand he was just worn out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: maybe coffee or drink of choice time|pg||
nt|kareno: NP Jan :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably heard what you said about two pairs out of two missing it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the knockout phase (starting tomorrow), the brackets will be formed taking into account both the WBF master points and the ranking in the round robin|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oliverc: much better|pg||
nt|panosk: he cant make 7 here though|pg||
nt|lml: Suit showed five spades and four hearts nicely|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz took a minute to play Dace, now says I had not problem on the first trick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: I think this will work out okay though.  north south dont have all that much|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intersting April -- normally operator can see all  [know all, etc]|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: North should make this.  He is going to guess spades on the auction|pg||
nt|lml: and East has no entries|pg||
nt|lml: he really can't make it without spades, he may as well go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after heart ace (if W wins it, he should lead back D 5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: well now we have only 1 other pair bidding the grand and four missing it|pg||
nt|lml: maybe an endplay though|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes sometimes passing all the time works well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: despite East's double, @SQ looks a moderately attractive lead  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: here it works ok|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: so on this line lead @CQ likely ducked,  Heart to hand club|pg||
nt|lml: but it seems a bit messy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: this will be over fast|pg||
nt|bobh1: its just not as much fun|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: NS upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|lml: well the OR missed the grand|pg||
nt|lml: he cant really travel back and forth|pg||
nt|lml: well lets see if it works|pg||
nt|kareno: (_)?   Tea for me - I'm pouring - and cookies for all except Roland :)  OOOOO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: If anyone has any idea of how to get caps lock off on a tiny little laptop; let me know!|pg||
nt|kareno: Have you tried hitting the caps key again?  Shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Yes - doesnt work - I have to hold it down to talk. I"ll bring my own computer next segment - wasnt supposed to be here - B is still thinking|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: I think he does have to play spades but maybe I am missing something|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcphee: gin|pg||
nt|oliverc: now|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens almost anything East tries is ok|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|lml: he is missing something he can go down now|pg||
nt|kareno: Trump leads would have been more effective for the defense.|pg||
nt|400 volt: did he really play @H K?|pg||
mc|9|nt|400 volt: obviously not|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table is in 3 NT this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they were claiming  at same time so no|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SA7HT5DK83CAKJ965,SJ543HAK732DA74CT,SK9862H8D9652CQ42,SQTHQJ964DQJTC873|sv|n|nt|lml: or -400 or -200|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you misguess clubs i guess you go down a lot|pg||
nt|lml: they were in 3@C in the CR so +10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so this is a plus position EW -- they got there and made it to boot|pg||
nt|dinos1: after 1@c opening and 1@h overcall has to guess the play|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|lml: it didn't show clubs|pg||
nt|lml: double here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I think dbl is a better hand for them after the 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken PASS=0-7|pg||
mb|4S|nt|caitlin: that is an ugly 4@H!|pg||
nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h - "law" bid? :)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't think Larry would approve|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: double would also imply more spades|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S is not a happy spot red or white|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the problem is the E hand is all defensive values and no shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: but who'll X 4@s after this bidding?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: bad choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who's DBL?   after strong 1@C  West DBL may not have any relation to West hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: W cant know pd has so much soft values|pg||
nt|lml: so the ladies manufacturered a winning position|pg||
nt|caitlin: I have noticed that many WC players are not automatically making the 4H 4S 'law bid' with all due respect to my friends Cohen & Bergen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in his 2007/2008 World Championship partnerships  Wests DBL would be 1-suit @C or @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: souths double, whichshe didnot make|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh ---  of 4@H    |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: a gutsy call by Auken leads to a pickup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the words of emily latilla:   never mind|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@h was a sort of trf to 4@s|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Sabine's 4@s bid was the winner in this auction -- again an agressive action, and this time it paid off|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|caitlin: does 4@S make.....I missed S's hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: its not close|pg||
nt|buffytvs: down 2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@h3@d1@s to lose|pg||
nt|lml: down 3 likely|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h3|mc|10|nt|ahollan1: force opponents to make the last guess --- huge winning tactic|pg||

nt|lml: so passing throughout was worth 5 imp|pg||
nt|lml: North is really on a roll here|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think he will do that on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: so he was hoping to endplay Versace but he did not have the communictions to do it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I can see the hands on BBO, but the screens block my view of NN &E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 4 from each group advance to KO    our match is from Group F  where current standings   1) Fleisher 187  2) Italian Stallions 181  3) Fredin 152  4) Chile 150   5th is distant ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C not 100% game force|pg||
nt|dburn: how many victory points is that?|pg||
nt|lml: I love watching Martel and Stansby, one of my favorite pairs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|riccho: I know that nobody is interested in that, but its an exciting game ... :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Anyone for X from East?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT is an interesting call, i thought we'll see the 1@c opening with 4-4-4-1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|oliverc: might get too high?|pg||
nt|mcphee: an upgrade?|pg||
nt|tlc: now..do you bid 3nt or game in spades now?|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d Multi.  4@h pass or correct.|pg||
nt|mamos: South has a big hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: He has an easy lead...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT a puppet to 3@C?|pg||
nt|400 volt: the other table guessed right in Board 4|pg||
nt|400 volt: so many imps for VITO|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H on for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: and after 3@H of josef piekarek i expect alexander smirnov to bid it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panosk: slight 1 :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be costly if N searchs for the slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: cannot pass 1@d with a stiff so i also agree with 2@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@d|pg||
nt|lml: 3@d now you think?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N  but with little conviction|pg||
nt|tlc: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho: me! maybe E X cards vanished? |pg||
nt|dburn: so he does, but why would anyone double?|pg||
nt|riccho: no no double here really :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Another cup of tea for this hand :)|pg||
nt|mamos: lol you drink faster than me  :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, my X says I have a good hand for my rprevious bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are hands where everything is right for declarer    then there is this hand|pg||
nt|tlc: it has the added advntage that 4S is likely to fail..and apparently does|pg||
nt|400 volt: as mike expectet, 2NT forces a 3@C bid, either weak with @C or a strong hand with a Major|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: W might pass this|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mathat: 6 now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 12 on a @C lead, though|pg||
nt|mcphee: Naturally now he should have with this lead|pg||
nt|lml: you have all noticed that Lauria discarded in a way that Van Cleeff could have recovered by throwing him in|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: why does it fail?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a make to me|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: I am with David .. pass and lead diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: director was here epressing concern about the slow play|pg||
nt|yuval10: considering the fact that other table already finished 8 boards, i guess he's right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a fairly common manoeuvre over a natural 2@C opening|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: remarkable restraint by Sementa but as a passed hand he refrained from hanging partner|pg||
nt|lml: it was the right lead to hold this hand tight I think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not... he doesnt really need the ruff does he|pg||
nt|stc: and this with Robson as declarer :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: I suppose he could bid 2@d and claim 100 honours even if he didn't make it, but...|pg||
nt|riccho: very reasonable not to double here|pg||
pg||

mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||

nt|vugraphztf: This is the last board I will keep the table open until ofiicial results published|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: tommorow we start at 10:00|pg||
nt|lml: he played spades at trick two|pg||
nt|lml: or three or whatever|pg||
nt|yuval10: things are getting more interesting here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not likely to be strong here, as North is a passed hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|itsgrim: another possible swing in for croatia here.  4 spades looks biddable and like it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, next round 15:45|pg||
nt|lml: you see if you were playing this at your club everybody would have been that 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N bid quickly when Bathhurst opened Martel hand 1N|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@s WK2 anyone? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: no|pg||
nt|stc: A grand is always a good result, let's|pg||
nt|stc: EW may even win IMP in 7NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many times you'll have a hand like W's when your P opens strong 2@c ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 2@c opening here - EW play 2@C as 5-11, 5@h+5any|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: played by North not best, but still shouldn't be any problem|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT might be making from W on a @s/@h squeeze, because he has only 12 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west passed?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h This and Last board to the end of the Teams Event and All the Greek Islands Fantoni Festival@h@h We thank BBO and Roland especially for giving us the chance to ...|pg||
nt|tlc: with probable uptrick on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right again Jim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because West never got chance to bid|pg||
nt|tlc: actually on the right=meter that's only 1 of 2 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: some form of two suited opening|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d best contract for n/s but 3nt could beckon again.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: C writing explanation for B; D just said it quietly for Z|pg||
nt|lml: so many reasons for no|pg||
nt|stc: For the specs, 7NT makes on a sqz @S/@H on N, dd of course|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming he gets a club lead, he has a double squeeze|pg||
nt|yuval10: right|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it seem as if @h lead from S will defeat 7NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  and that is not double dummy|pg||
nt|stc: If E play, the @H lead beats|pg||
nt|henryb:  how on earth would East become the declarer?|pg||
nt|yuval10: many kibitzers argue that 1@s is better to open from E's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d sry|pg||
nt|stc: of course all this is hypothetical, they will play in @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if the "any" can be spades|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1NT 15-17, he obviously didn't like to treat his hand as a 1@C opening|pg||
mb|2S|nt|400 volt: 2@D showing a 6card major|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@S pass/correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has worked out which major South has....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e talking|pg||
nt|400 volt: I expect south to raise to 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and is prepared to go on in hearts if that is South's suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
nt|dburn: would not mind it if playing a method where 2@d was a bad weak two, and 2@s constructive|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: LTC says N does not have a raise to the 3 level, but it is hard to resist with those trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will bid Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
nt|lml: excdept for the four card heart suit... it always burns me|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you play that way, you can often show 6-4 in the majors in response to an inquiry|pg||
nt|lml: headed for 3NT I suppose|pg||
nt|stc: OR opened 1@d which, on this hand at least, is much better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very popular in Europe, this 2@D overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's quite tough now for Nickell|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course he'll never pass, but it's not easy for them to understand they need to agree over @d|pg||
nt|400 volt: @S lead will make it difficult|pg||
nt|milton_se: trump lead probably sets it|pg||
nt|400 volt: but with the east hand I do not see a good option to @S lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can use it over other things as well - strong club, prepared club, loose diamond openings  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump seems a good lead here, as South is marked with excellent spades  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: s went to wash room w has both hands waitinhg for lead said he was changing cards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
nt|400 volt: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: obviously he doesn't like the ones he's got |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be interesting to find out if Martel was going to invite over 1@S-P|pg||
nt|mamos: ther eshould not be a danger of overbidding here with two Black Aces missing  but you never know ..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @d better|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@c is a very aggressive intervention. But as u c N advancing, he is expecting that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c might very well be interpret as agreeing @s, as many kibz suggested|pg||
nt|henryb:  Two suiters are often easier when you open one of the suits|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Ax is not such a great stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  I tink West will raise to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps 7NT |pg||
pc|h7|nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: yes it is|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: helpful lead as it happens|pg||
nt|panosk: it seems we have a clear winner here|pg||
nt|panosk: gd performance by |pg||
nt|marlowepi: al;most surely he would bid 2S over pass, especially NV|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..and i think almost everyone would bid 3S in the actual auction...too dangerous to withhold support and values|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panosk: Zaleski team and congratulations|pg||
nt|yuval10: no, appearently he got it right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So a struggle here, but a quick play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Katz:  "thats all"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the diamond suit here is "frozen" - whoever plays a diamond first will have to give a trick away|pg||
nt|400 volt: I think double dummy you can now hold it to -1 as declarer|pg||
nt|400 volt: you have to exit with @C 10, east has to play a @H, you ruff and draw all @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: Well done in both rooms!|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: W loved the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: count cards lead from 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally it would mean H king likely to be onside|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: ace and another would have worked better as it turns out|pg||
nt|400 volt: so east has to keep @C AQ and @D A10, then you can exit with a @C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|nt|lml: it will be good enough today|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: South is a bit worried about the heart break|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but 3NT is not such a bad contract - still, I guess North was considering 3@d, and might have bid it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: 3Nt will make for the same reason 6@D makes|pg||
nt|milton_se: was enough to play C from dummy :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: he needs a club ruff but he also wants to cash the @SK|pg||
nt|lml: hard to handle all the entries|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @d situation will save him|pg||
nt|riccho: indeed|pg||

nt|buffytvs: E has a tough bid over North's expected dbl|pg||
nt|lml: they need a way to find diamonds|pg||
mb|2C|an|not forcing|mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: very hard -- all the diamond bids will sound like spade support|pg||
nt|lml: maybe in the next round|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3@c is @s supp|pg||
nt|dinos1: so 3@d - nat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was going to say DBL unlikely since vonArnim won't hold 4@H    i thought choice was 1N or 2@C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: intersting choice by North -- did not dbl|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ah yes -- forgot they play 4-cd majors and canape style|pg||
nt|lml: how many clubs by south|pg||
nt|dinos1: didnt X coz S doesnt have 4@h|pg||
mb|2S|an|good hand|mb|d|nt|vugraphzsu: also neg free bids, so double followed by suit is forcing, i think|pg||
nt|dinos1: strictly it's not canape style - just always open in major if have it (mb 5M4m)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen quite a few 10-card fits this set|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what west's double means|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Sergey    1@H/@S is either 5+ suit  OR  4-card and maybe 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|dinos1: "unbid" suit? :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so maybe dbl says 'i did have 5 of them'?|pg||
nt|lml: does it show the fourth suit?  I am not so sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: a feat to have made 1NT with 5@D 1@C and 1@S for E-W|pg||
nt|lml: I think he means it to show diamonds though|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: one of the rare times there is potential gain for nebulous [2+] 1@D |pg||
nt|lml: I think enough fooling around 3@C... yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: chance for E to back in with 3@D|pg||
nt|dinos1: interesting what wd be X of 2@c?|pg||
nt|lml: I think East will bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: okay then|pg||
nt|lml: wrong again|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: so the 1@D bid apparnetly prevented EW from finding their 10-card fir|pg||

nt|eleni: The 2 leading teams, with 1p difference:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last round today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, most europeans favor specific 2-suited overcalls as opposed to Michaels|pg||
nt|riccho: this hand is an example for that|pg||
nt|riccho: last hand... |pg||
nt|lml: they should get to slam on this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: director again warning about time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the first ltr of card is name of other team mates|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this week i've seen most variations of Ghestem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good minor shapes for D here but stiff heart is worrisome|pg||
nt|lml: anybody in this field who misses it will be embarrassed|pg||
nt|riccho: 6@s is a must for a serious partnership here, or?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@h pass or correct as before.|pg||
nt|400 volt: Agressive bidding by Sabine Auken in Board 5 paid out well: instead of dbling 4@S they ended in 5@H, dbled down 1 for 11 IMPs for JOSEF and CARDS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: what should West do now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: this is another hadn where all participants will get their money's worth in the auction...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those variations about the same....yyour Ghestem's as good as mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I do not promise I get all the spots right every hand, but he did not play KH|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 4@H on  6 was worth 11 imps - one down in 5@Hx at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: he's gone for Pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass is expected by west.|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D is at least 2 cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry,  5|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good lead by Balicki.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: haven't noticed that bridge players "do" embarassment|pg||
nt|dburn: 7 IMPs to Fleischer came on board 5, where delcarer in this room took a seriously wrong (but entirely reasonable) view of the club suit in 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
nt|400 volt: its funny, both partnerships at the table have a 10 card fit and didnt find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's done EW out of quite a nice diamond fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: seldom to play 1 NT when there are 2 huge fits|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: thx April...normally in that situation after a finesse one plays the card one is known to hold|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT strong spade raise, 3@h natural, 3@s waiting - no shortage - 4@d short diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: this one should be a quick one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
nt|mamos: Club position is crucial to the number of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a minimum -3 for 800.  Another good pickup for Cayne.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you haven't worked as vugraph operator you should know that the ABSOLUTE toughest part of the job is play of the hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry me too|pg||
nt|panosk: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h improvisation - "last train" not actually part of the methods|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club shift needed so club doesn't go away.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
nt|dburn: Blackwood, one key card...|pg||
nt|riccho: looks like you know NS very well... :)|pg||
nt|lml: so far one pair has missed the slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ...stumbling towards Blackwood|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many players never let you see their cards, most just give you a glimpse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thanks Al! I agree.|pg||
nt|riccho: and their mothods|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: I do have the WBF convention card open now|pg||

nt|lml: this is actually a decent slam|pg||
nt|lml: all you need to do is bring home the hearts missing five to the jack|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: it is my dylexia|pg||
nt|bobh1: needed a @d lead here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East probably expecting 5/5 opposite - he's right if he does - just not the 5/5 he would expect |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria will try|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are not on the same page then. 6D was written|pg||
nt|dburn: I have played with them both once or twice|pg||
nt|lml: the team is Belgium Cooreman so we can all know which team needs to be embarrased|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: which was once too often for Malinowski - we missed a game, and he vowed never to play with me again|pg||
nt|400 volt: board 6 Daniela von Arnim is playing 4@S, but it's looking pretty well for her|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: yes defence is very strong  both E and W have very clear idea of what they are doing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|400 volt: 9 tricks already there and the 10th is probably coming|pg||

nt|ahollan1: earlier today i thought it interesting that Fantunes missed 2 8-card fits in @S   that is much more bizarre then our EW missing 10-card @D|pg||
nt|lml: East no doubt has a way to show the majors|pg||
nt|dinos1: X = both M's?|pg||
nt|dinos1: over strong @c|pg||
nt|lml: people play all sorts of things I am not sure about east-west|pg||
mb|1N|an|majors or minors|nt|dinos1: or they have conv to show 5-5?|pg||
mb|2N|an|one suit|nt|dinos1: 5@h from E is makeable w/o @d lead|pg||
nt|lml: I doubt that has to be 5-5|pg||
mb|4D|an|pass or correct|nt|dinos1: now 3@d?|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh - 4 :)|pg||
nt|lml: North cant really tell what suit south has|pg||
nt|lml: she is pretty sure its a minor though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably thinks its diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it certainly could be|pg||
nt|buffytvs: do you like 4NT here by North?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be thinking more than 52 cards in the deck|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dinos1: what wd be 2M over 1N?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is like a 30 card deck with these fits|pg||
nt|lml: Sharyn Reus suggested pass and bid over 4@H but this will work too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I ,ike this -- let them sturggle to find their save suit at the 5-level|pg||
nt|dinos1: pass - and all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i only know meaning of bids over 1N always showing minors :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 5-level guess coming up|pg||
nt|lml: we are committed to it |pg||
nt|lml: so should east pass and possibly bid later or bid now|pg||
nt|dinos1: now S will certainly lead @d ag 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bring back  Ed Manfield  to explain who owns the 5-level|pg||
nt|buffytvs: always the opponents :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it is very hard for each side to judge how high to go|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that long tank by E could create a problem for West now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|buffytvs: but this looks ok|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: just waiting developments|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last year in the USBF Women's Trials, some of the ladies from knocked out teams worked as operator and commented on how they'd never realized problems that players give operator -- ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that was great epiphany for most|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 16 board sessions|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lets do the time warp again|pg||
nt|tlc: using their time machine i'd guess to gho back?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe   maybe not 2001    more likely 2011   [fat finger syndrome?]|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: thanks... I was awaiting for a bit|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was -1|pg||
nt|lml: away|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oliverc: I suspect that'll be a poor result for NS, as there is no game on the other way|pg||
nt|400 volt: At least I expect N/S to find their huge fit now :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: and E/W, too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: defense was good...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) BAL  1/2/3 NV v V 13-15 else 11-13  4th 11-14  b) (10)11-15(16) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  c) (10)11-15(16) any 4441    NEG DBL => 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@h makes (better by north but the diamond is onside so it doesn't matter).|pg||
nt|dburn: hide your eyes, Roland|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is this the last pair using Flannery in the world?|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Flanery - limited opening bid, five hearts, four spades|pg||
nt|riccho: flannery??|pg||
nt|lml: no there are at least 3 others]|pg||
nt|riccho: stone age convention resurrected|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose it might just fit into your methods|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @c slam is not good, but certainly acceptable|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C showing both majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for an explanation|pg||
nt|tlc: mind numbing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: less clear than MUD|pg||
nt|stc: you need to guess the @d position I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: 2@H is weak and 2NT is asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asking|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think you have a pointed suit squeeze|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C=both majors, at least 4/4 (!)|pg||
nt|400 volt: i'd bet ending the auction at least at the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: most probably |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually had a bid to describe exactly 5@D & 4@C  but  those @C .... yuk|pg||
nt|kareno: Normal heart play works (for the drop).|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, a who's who of Flannery players is being delivered to me|pg||
nt|riccho: I´m told that hamman-zia and weinstein-levin still play flannery|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT or 3NT or pass|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing wrong with Flannery at all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sufficiently high level to constitute a STRONG recommendation|pg||
nt|lml: which one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I didn't think Roland allowed the F-word|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? Nickell passed?|pg||
nt|stc: how do you play on a @c lead ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he did|pg||
nt|stc: and @c again when you give the @s ?|pg||
nt|400 volt: south should bid 5@C now|pg||
nt|400 volt: and I expect west to go on|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: ty April :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he doesnt have four clubs. he has 2 low doubletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that like  @SA  @HA  @DA  @CA  is just 2-pair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N jand not enhanced by S bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I saw that McAvoy underled the diamond honors and declarer went wrong.. well done|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z discussing something - I think that 2@c promised 4|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand for 2@C so is now probably worrying about going on|pg||
nt|riccho: the best with flannery is, that you cannot play another stupid 2level opening obstruction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether they have a clear agreement on 2NT here|pg||
nt|lml: well it probably made the north south auction tougher here|pg||
nt|400 volt: but I was wrong :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 3@d showed 2 top hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe, but I get lots of weak hands and not many 5/4 openers|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mcphee: hope I am not too late|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi bob|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Bob, not at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: only K@H is off side, rest all good|pg||
nt|lml: but denied a maximum or 6-4|pg||
nt|riccho: X from N is what every intervention by NS is... |pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive|pg||
nt|henryb:  you lose a spade, win the club, cross ruff majors and cash the @cQ which squeezes West|pg||
nt|yuval10: only now Nickell "woke up" , a tad too late|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I don't like it either but it was effective here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, West passed in first seat and East may be light in third - double is normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North has to X - as a passed hand it's not a big issue|pg||
nt|400 volt: now i expect north to bid 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S just too much with those red slowballs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4??   whoa baby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S at most. if S can make 4S facing this tripe he will bid it over 3S 97% of the time|pg||
nt|tlc: hope springs eternal|pg||
nt|400 volt: with no @C trick coming, and the @S Qxx onside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: possible swing in the last board, thats all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been reminded Martel-Stansby actually were on Rose Meltzer's winning team of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: this is the Worlds and IMPs!!!|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it seem as if NS can always find their @c fit|pg||
nt|400 volt: but the right decision here, 5@H one down after @D lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lml: cute lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: most of the field is in 3NT which will do well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|riccho: long time studies with 2l-openings showed, that WK2 openings have a minus expected value|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: now that is a problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: Shenkin wide awake ruffing high|pg||
nt|lml: well done VanCLeeff|pg||
nt|lml: the opening lead set declarer up and now the trump promotion takes him down|pg||
nt|lml: that should cheer up north-south|pg||
nt|lml: staring at it will not help Versace|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Versace is thinking hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact S might bid 4S over 3S with his actual hand, so even 3S seems ambitious, especially NV. curious that N would be so ambitious here in a set where NS have heretofore shown ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consistent prudence in regard to NV games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room where Zagorin overcalled 1@S and Bathurst bid 2@S in comp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it certainly is!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question from spec:  was @D8 signal for @H?         very possible - or reverse count with 5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: he has too many trump to endplay north|pg||
nt|stc: I was expecting the set to finish at about this time, have to go, by all, c u later |pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: "how could he underlead the ace????"|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since South could be pretty strong - that's the thing about Flannery: a hand that would bid 1NT over 1@h cannot so easily bid 2NT over 2@d|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: of this score were to hold up at the end of the set Rayner would overtake Lavazza who would drop to third place|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: the Canadians will pick up an imp on this board due to a better lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|milton_se: best possible result for NS|pg||

pc|c3|nt|400 volt: b6 no swing, daniela von arnim guessed the situation wrong at the end and played @D to the king|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lml: keycard tells you that the trump queen is not there |pg||
nt|bobh1: i think it's about 54%...plus whatever edge declarer can find by card-reading|pg||
nt|lml: apparently it was alerted as a MAX.  I am just reading the card|pg||
nt|lml: which is in teeny print even at 125%|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in 3rd seat -- Martel-Stansby don't cheat on the Weak NT openers|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose chip will venture a light passed hand t/o X?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bit surprised Lew did not open in 3rd seat at these colours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his only choice was 1N --- or 1@D then pass all responses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the latter is what i had in mind|pg||

nt|kareno: That redouble could show the high honor in hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually prefer to use it with ace or king only however.|pg||

nt|lml: int the latter case Marteil will be endplayed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile both minors may be viable at the 3 level|pg||

nt|marlowepi: true, but there is almost surely a three level fit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: but i think all of the hand types for 4th seat 1@D mean there is either a minor fit OR partner has BAL 15-16|pg||

nt|kareno: So far Cayne pitching a shutout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: okay off the schneider... thanks guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: today's matches are 56 boards in four stanzas|pg||
nt|dburn: weak 2@d available if South elects to use it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahri: strong club with symmetric relay system here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS but i doubt anybody can get there...|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs looks a likely partscore for n/s.  |pg||
nt|mamos: for me 2@C would be Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, only 56.  In our US events we start (and end) with 64 board matches.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would be bidding 3@c to play.  2@c would be stayman for me too.|pg||
nt|mamos: roland told me 56  so ...... I believe him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: really do not like that call|pg||
nt|dburn: but now it gets a bit ugly, because North's 2@h is (as I recall) not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: It doesnt help Martel to split on the previous round.  South wins and playes a spade and Martel is endplayed in the blacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 2D does not promise diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: W gambles that E has a few|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: tesla has interesting hand pattern so i believe he'll ask several relays and settle in game when he finds out nothing awesome at west's hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am told it is 18-19 BAL with no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx you all know more than I do :)  not a lot of talking going on here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H now by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: We must believe Roland (or die) :)|pg||
nt|riccho: Here u can see the advantage of a flannery opening... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: presumably this is transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s transfer I imagine.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit I would think twice about bidding 1@S|pg||
nt|400 volt: this is a "boring" 1NT in imps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: wow he bid it!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that on this sequence by W, E will know that W has diamond length|pg||
nt|lml: North is very strong for 2@H if it is not forcing ... I know he has a diamond void but|pg||
nt|riccho: S agrees with your statement here david|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he must have seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
nt|400 volt: (i must admit i would not even think about bidding 1@S :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: If this is the route to 5@D I like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a lucky make next door|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have bid anyway, since she has an above-average hand for hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice 9 count with Hx in @H - worth a try|pg||
nt|400 volt: you will come home with 7-9 tricks anyhow, but not important in IMPs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if Nystrom didn't like @D - he could bid 3-card major with zero points|pg||
nt|tlc: nystrom's dbl indicates he has passed a likely 6-7 pt hand and wants to let his partner in on the secret..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has passed 1D but now shown some values, so he was willing to play diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: Makes 3 or 4 depending heart guess.  More tea anyone?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 56 is a long day for the WBF - Bermuda Bowl & Olympiad are 48 board days (3 16s). I think that here the later rounds (donàt know what that means though 'R8 or semi) will be 60.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: Zia in S didn't open his hand next door|pg||
nt|dburn: East might have reopened this, but he is probably too tired|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that à I canàt find the apostrophe|pg||
nt|lml: she might but I think a pass can be forgiven|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think she was (rightly) ashamed of it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: yes commentating is a tough job........|pg||
nt|hedyg: what they dont wont do to prove us wrong..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I might think it, but I;m pretty sure I wouldn't do it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural lead. Not sure what the doubled asked for in the other room|pg||
nt|tlc: with some good guessing this may come home...|pg||
nt|milton_se: would pass after one thought :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzsv: i understand both tables got there.|pg||
nt|dburn: but of the 150 conventions in the world worse than Flannery, non-forcing responses to weak two bids are a very long way up the list|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahri: east knows west's hand pattern but i believe he's restricted to 8-11 from 1@s initial response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be a heart as we see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these guesses should be indicated|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: agreed |pg||
nt|400 volt: (ok, there have been more than one championship lost by one imp, but....)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: N has shown a good hand|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahri: figured out he does not have slam unless west has absolutely perfect hand (AAK) which might be restricted anyway.|pg||
nt|ahri: restricted as in "bid differently" :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Cayne has now taken the lead in his group|pg||
nt|riccho: I think its worth a post mortem discussion if u get in 2@h with 25 combined points here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is often a good holding for notrump. It's a "certain" stopper with LHO on lead if he has the ace and if his partner has it, South must still find the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not here because he had an attractive alternative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS  have no effective options that i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and we get to see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|tlc: ducking the heart was their best chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no, nf bids are good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in one of the other vugraph matches  China Open 18  vs  Lavazza 9     Lavazza entered the round tied for 3/4   it would be huge upset if they didn't make the KO|pg||
nt|riccho: at least here 3NT is a fine contract|pg||
nt|dburn: they cater for a very wide range of hands where you ought to play in a part score - they make it very difficult to play in normal game contracts|pg||
nt|henryb:  why doesn't he claim|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: ho hum   another 1570 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you have a weird little computer there!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's true, but if you ant to move toward game you can start with 2NT |pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: they may have to rethink this 2@d convention|pg||
nt|lml: www.bridgeblogging.com .. spelling error|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: This is GROUP C|pg||
nt|lml: so Shenking is showing hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: exactly 5H and 4 or more in a minor|pg||
nt|lml: there was one other pair in 2@H so far and one in 6|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: sure you can, but then no one knows whether you are bidding suits or stoppers or anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: aggressive 2N bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no kidding!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not too hard to design a method that handles that|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his black suits in|pg||
nt|yuval10: another 2@c with 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trick here is to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobh1: if u lose the preemptive effect of the way other pairs use 2@d and things like this can also happen...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this is one of the exceptional hands with which S should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boring after his recent 5206 |pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I'm sure that on balance there isn't much between the approaches|pg||
nt|lml: with 5-5 that does seem like the right approach although his suits are a bit ratty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well this is what you get for X with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what the double is about but it may help to get to the slam|pg||
nt|lml: which of course fails|pg||
nt|lml: I am still trying to understand the double.  Maybe he though he was too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a couple of other suits to consider besides spades...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: announced as halftime... noted that these guys are quite ahead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I didnàt see an alert, but often people donàt alert forcing NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so pick one that suits your ... temperament|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had a choice of cuebids -- 2@h is probably natural|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Another strong result for Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahri: very.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s not enough, 4@s too final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW may never get in here|pg||
nt|ahri: 4@s should fail too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|tlc: spade cards arent going to excite lew much, altho 11-12 hcp (using the new math) is|pg||
nt|lml: will south sell?|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now if will likely prevent EW of playing their excellent 6@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c looks odd |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: i like how bidding is completely different from other room. minors in action here, majors there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a cheap save vs 4@H (if they find it, but 5@D is also on|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that might happen|pg||
nt|tlc: 4s here should do the trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess it isn't forcing.  Good contract.  More tea :)|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@D is natural, forcing I was told|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahri: 4@h can be set by two diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find 4H dubious. even if pd has 3 hearts, 5D could easily prove a much better game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby just completing his shape with 4@H  -- well 5@H 6+@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can all see 9, but the 10th looks a bit elusive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3 c low pt count|pg||
nt|400 volt: this will be a fast 1 down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobh1: he had a double game swing available...as it is he will do quite well on the board|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|lml: on the auction this is a lousy slam|pg||
nt|mamos: well this is comfortable --  the teapot is empty|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: I think Stanicic should have bid 3@H instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not overcall 1@H, so 3@H shows a diamond fit too|pg||
nt|ahri: and almost surely 4 cards.|pg||
nt|ahri: or 5 very bad ones|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria should have considered that Versace thought he had clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: not that the road to 6@h is so easy after 1@s opening by W....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Joe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahri: quite gentle auction here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 5@C?|pg||
nt|tlc: i believe 4h may have been kickback (rkc for diam)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H was KC io think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh could be|pg||
nt|tlc: chip showed 2 w/o in that case|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: otherwise 5C makes no sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is only way 5@C makes sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Marshall typed faster|pg||
nt|dburn: the much-maligned Flannery picked up 6 IMPs for Fleischer, who reached 3NT on board 8|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: If Tesla had got 3@H from partner he would not have sold out to 3@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: well, he did, sort of|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: this hand looks perfect for polish @c bidders|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobh1: in the other room, Bocchi never bid with the N hand which I find amazing|pg||
nt|lml: very sort of|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzsv: Z: it doesn't look nice, D not going down|pg||
nt|lml: I think Fleischer likely has a pickup on board 10 too|pg||
nt|tejjyid: curiously though, it gained them by working as a pre-empt|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: it is possible that the @CJ would be onside short|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: even so 5@c was rather ambitious imo|pg||
nt|lml: yes the two cooperated to get to high|pg||
pc|hK|nt|milton_se: trying to establish an endplay, but suits are to evenly divided|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: it has happened so many times to me that a bad bid by me or my pd has brought a bad bid by the other pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thinking about discarding 7C|pg||
nt|lml: North does know what to keep though|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: now thinking about 8@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only real chance was @DKQJ trebleton|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: throwing the last club is probably best|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but     seems strange to ask KC holding void in suit where partner probably has values  and then not to do something other than 5@D over DBL|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|tlc: mb lew should have passed..if chip had the club ace he could XX...then lew would know to sign off..otherwise,,bid the slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  colour me confused|pg||
nt|milton_se: even KQ in Cs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: there it goes|pg||
nt|lml: we are slowly ... going 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect the fact that N did not bid 3S over 3H made S think that S ace was not among N assets|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|milton_se: or KJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so that two ruffs would set up the @D10 |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is a competition for European nations with less than 500 members of their respective federations|pg||
nt|lml: well my boys are running away with this match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now to find the quote key, and I'll have this keyboard all figured out!|pg||
nt|riccho: chagas - levy "avoided" the 6@s slam in Bd7|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West might barely just have bashed something - 1@c (3@c) pass (4@c) would have left Polish bidders in the same boat as natural bidders|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: remarks along the lines of interesting hand at the table...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very possible 2 different interpretations of 4@H -- hope April gets the lowdown|pg||
nt|tlc: if lew thot it was a cue bid, then the spade ace was missing..very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Not allowed to ask.  the heart bid was not alerted|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: does martel squeak|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahri: another chance for a swing to slovakia, 4@h should make|pg||
nt|ahri: for non-europeans, 17:15 is in 25 minutes :)|pg||
nt|ahri: 1@d not promising diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: as warned earlier the running scores site is very slow right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: be patient and you will get in eventually|pg||
nt|lml: try either www.bridgeblogging.com or www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so much for the NS heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, finals start at 15:00|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a European and it is 16:15 for me :)|pg||
nt|ahri: sorry to english people.|pg||
nt|ahri: and other timezone people! 17:15 CET is in 25 minutes :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think passing 2@S on the previous board is a mistake for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: could and probably should have been more interesting|pg||
nt|dburn: but East-West at the other table had a free run, given which missing slam was on the criminal side|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: B asks C if his pass denied 3 @hs and he shakes his head|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@s is forcing then i wonder what 3@h would be over 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: it would have been [a] forcing and [b] a better idea than 4@h, which should be the same hand without @dA|pg||
nt|400 volt: will n/s stop early enough?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|buffytvs: so Martel's tactical 1@H bought the hand for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well I dont wish either team to do poorly.  I am a big fan of Lavazza but go Canucks|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians seem to lack their customary energy in this match|pg||
nt|lml: no matter they will be in this event for a long time|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess they're just relaxing at this stage|pg||
nt|bobh1: they will turn up the heat in a day or two|pg||
nt|bobh1: a lot of bidding in this room|pg||
nt|bobh1: once again the Canadians are exhibiting a much better approach|pg||
nt|lml: it might play well though|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think its a make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no discussion of result -- the orginal Blue Team taught us that is good for partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2NT by N would have been stronger then 3@H|pg||
nt|kareno: I had a good time once trying to type something serious on a French keyboard.  Yikes!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Another one-suited takeout double :)  I imagine north will support hearts.|pg||
nt|lml: they may make a few on the good splits|pg||
nt|dburn: well, so would pass have done, but he has improved the contract|pg||
nt|400 volt: but east has no good lead available|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahri: chance for down three and an imp for slovakia|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem as if NS has 5 losers in 2@h|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, who jumped to 4@h after his partner's overcall, described that as "doing a Meckstroth"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: so it will be 27 or 28 lead on halftime|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Handsome lead going into the last 12 boards|pg||
nt|ahri: ops, two imps :)|pg||
nt|lml: the hearts can set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: tactical, or systemic?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the auction in the other room was very weak imo|pg||
nt|lml: the momentum has really swung around in this match, amazing|pg||
nt|milton_se: he'll probably not find KS|pg||
nt|400 volt: i expect east to lead a @H and north to misguess @D, for at least 1 down|pg||
nt|400 volt: B8, E/W are playing 5@H undoubled, too... South lead a @D, so 1 down, too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n e talking|pg||
nt|400 volt: if north finds @D Q doubleton, east will be squeezed later. But i would bet much that he will not find|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: holding k s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: put it back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: stil thinking|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: With diamonds friendly and the spade guess pretty clear, this can make 4.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: the S hand is too good for a weak jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: McAvoy sorry if this is wrong I have no HCPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but you have distro out the kazoo|pg||
nt|lml: its always good to apologize when you think you are making it|pg||
nt|lml: I never apologize when I think we are going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: much better than being confident and going down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it might be very close now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: jack..|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin, wow, nice hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: and Senior asked whether Meckstroth had ever done a Zia|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: he's max HCP -- wonder how much stronger the hand can get  [just kidding  @SQx dubious value]|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: North might have thought about doubling 1@H I suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 2@c bid by E since the double by W is usually mainly for majors and could have a doubleton @C|pg||
nt|lml: but his hearts are a bit ragged|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores are back|pg||
nt|kareno: But not a game to bid even vul, I would say.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: Belgians on a role +1 on successive boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you don't think S would have balanced over 1@D-P-P?|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt it|pg||
nt|lml: can make as much as four now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahri: some people ask what's the halftime score for 3rd place, roland, do you have any info?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thinking about trick 1 - maybe the ten is a better card |pg||
nt|400 volt: west showed he liked @H lead, but would like it with J109, too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: with the 22 @s's this is home free|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: most roads lead to 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: interesting bidding|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|milton_se: on the other hand, no setting trick unless Hs are good enough|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|s4|nt|lml: all aproaches work here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: The Cayne team will happily give away an IMP here and there :)  So this is the antepenultimate board of the set.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: now a @H?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|ahri: a push, so this is the halftime score|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Zia always tells me that you should respond on bad hands if you think the opponents might make 3NT, but not if you don't|pg||
nt|lml: Martel had every reason to believe they could make it|pg||
nt|lml: so he was following the ZIa rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you should follow Zia's advice when it is correct too David, but not otherwise|pg||
nt|riccho: as with every rule... |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I always follow it anyway - I get shouted at less|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pg||

nt|lml: the Italians are being taken minus.  The Canadians already had 25 VP before the last board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am wondering what the balance sheet is on playing superaccept & weak NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should get to slkam here|pg||
nt|kareno: Misguessing spades.  Why?  I think he hopes the spade ace is with east in case they bid the game in the OR.|pg||
nt|mamos: that really didt make much sense |pg||
nt|riccho: yes its so easy to make the mistakes which partner advised to|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, on that hand he'd probably have shouted at me anyway for not raising spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, Zia is a coach? I had no idea|pg||
nt|riccho: no rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not all rubber players give lessons|pg||
nt|riccho: at rubber bridge it pays to punish partner for his mistakes|pg||
nt|riccho: you get him twice back as an opponent|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, de Botton picked up eight IMPs in bits and pieces - six for a fearless balance by Sandqvist on 9 and (remarkably) 2 when the combined 25 count was played in 2@d and not ...|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good buy|pg||
nt|lml: since four of a minor is available north south|pg||
nt|lml: bye now heading for dinner|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|hedyg: Auken has taken over the lead group lead|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR on the earlier hand East just bid 4@d over the heart preempt and will be surprised perhaps ito win imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this slam can be defeated|pg||
nt|lml: Rayner has moved into a tie for first in the division|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: W led the @c A|pg||
nt|lml: they cashed the @ca at trick one and it was all over|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe at mps that lead is normal|pg||
nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps?|pg||
nt|lml: so we are near a tie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S, 4@S [if Kickback],  what other options?     nope never thought about 4@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy contender for "filthy  overcall of the year" honors|pg||
nt|mamos: just lost an imp|pg||
nt|kareno: I would bid 1nt (if it is in range) with four hearts and diamonds, but not with spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether Katz could double for penalty and chose not to, or whether his double would be conventional|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussion between Katz and Allfrey|pg||
nt|dburn: but North rather than West is forced to bid 2@d on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why that got alerted - just a limit raise, as far as I know|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@H surely|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a limit raise has become artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: S alerted. however N did not|pg||
nt|riccho: unusual convention |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might, but 3@h may have the feel of a pre-balance, so I guess he could pass|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||
nt|tlc: it has my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute treatment  ---   i was going to guess a version of Swiss with bad trump|pg||
nt|riccho: well done martel|pg||
nt|dburn: he did pass|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bobh1: leading unsupported aces is not a growth industry at imps|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: i meant|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z's DBL showed a 5 card Major and another suit at least 4 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Stoppers in both majors and hopes for the club suit.  |pg||
nt|kareno: North needed the eight of clubs this time.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'm about to designate Z as the best player to be a VG operator for - he explains things very clearly with gestures so I can figure out what he's said :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, gestures and he isn't even Italian :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: trust your opponents|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
nt|milton_se: passed the "making point" now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=0-6, and this is definitely the lower range of 0 |pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|tlc: "last train" for any specs that might wonder means "I want to make a final slam try, but have nothing specific to say without getting past game"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be quick claim too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: typically it is an artificial use of the call just below the game level|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they were kind enough to write that one down for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you are the best Operator - you bring the room to life for us as well as following the play and explanations.  I'm always happy to see you in my room :)  Thanks again!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
nt|400 volt: 2@C is a nonforcing-stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e said small w said nothing else|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: he thought maybe Sementa had the stiff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobh1: certainly is possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: The cards just won't stretch for nine tricks.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzsv: Tough hand to defend though - Z must be worried that another spade will be declarer's 9th trick, not knowing about those minor suit spots in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He can be patient about the spade.  Meanwhile, north is playing on diamonds - if clubs were solid I think he'd be going after his ninth trick in hearts.  |pg||
nt|kareno: South, that is,|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Although, if the @d6 is upside down count, either partner has those higher spots or declarer only has 3 spades (with 6 @ds)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: pretty well everything works except two rounds of trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: he can claim now so this is about an overtrick...he should just take his 10|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson can pick up spades for an overtrick, but is likely just to lead to the ace|pg||
nt|400 volt: this will be 1 down|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|tokay1975: does anyone know the link for running scores|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ty|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he had better not do anything weird like putting in the nine - but he may believe that West has four spades|pg||

nt|tlc: this is an amazingly low IMP total given the number of wild and crazy hands we've seen|pg||
nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: these hands fit well|pg||
nt|kareno: Great slam missed by Belgium in the OR.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z chatting - Z says "I told you at least 5 and at least 4 - had 55" All very friendly by both of them|pg||
nt|kareno: West certainly could have bid 4@c over 3@c by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rob: I made the minimum,  Katz:  min would have been if youhooked the spade nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: would be very inspired to say the least to lead a @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. Well done Joe, excellent job|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the score is now 25 VP for Rayner and only 3 for Lavazza|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this Flannery?|pg||
nt|lml: do you like the weak 2 with four cards in the other major|pg||
nt|lml: and in second chair|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Zagorin-Bathurst struggled with  11     they also stalled at 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Nystrom remarked.. thinks it was their first constructive auction lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = RELAY, FG  [says nothing about @C]|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: not when the other major is this good|pg||
nt|lml: no it was a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: pretty sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: well way too strong for a multi imo|pg||
nt|400 volt: 1@D makes it easier to describe the hand later|pg||
nt|400 volt: even if he has 18 and could open 1@C, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now some people dont like bidding 1NT in that position as natural but I think it is just fine myself|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT as 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: splinter for clubs thoughg 2C was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i assume|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the answers to the relays :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: i am told i am wrong|pg||
nt|tlc: for partnerships that play Kickback ( a version of RKC where the key card ask is the step above the trump suit) frequently have issues when one partner has both D-H and the other ...|pg||
nt|tlc: believes 4H is Kickback in  Diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am used to it:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Just as it should be - bridge at the highest levels is still a game of gentlemen.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone know the WBF site to follow all the matches?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, and ladies :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: so finally the last board of this quarter|pg||
nt|400 volt: but everytime difficult to bid hands with @D in a baltic/polish @C system|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: swangames has running scores|pg||
nt|mamos: hang on I'll find addy|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from 1@H-2@C   i think 3@D says  5-7 zz points [A3 K2 Q1] with short @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not HCP   zz points [aka AKQ points]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: he did write down 3 - 2 - 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Bertheau has 8   A[3] A[3] K[2]|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ok thanks.  someone will explain zz points to me at the bar later.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: story i've been told about "zz"    the author didn't know what to call the treatment so used filler of "zz" -- too many people had read draft before official name could be given, ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so zz stuck|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Van Cleeff was one of the authors of a book called the Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|lml: apparently someone says they shows both majors 6-11.  He doesnt have that either really|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as multi.  |pg||
nt|lml: now if it show 6/4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty April!|pg||
nt|lml: yes I thought it was that... he loves multi and Mudienberg 2's which came up earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: your welcome. |pg||
nt|lml: April is the best|pg||
nt|tlc: suppose when the smoke clears they will land in the reasoanable 6Cs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: next session in 55 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i prefer sandwich but most good players agree with you|pg||
nt|kareno: Try http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|riccho: last bd here for this session|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is natural but unlimited - difficult call for North here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is the auction GF yet?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s was in theory forcing to game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: presumably it is, so 3@C looks OK|pg||
nt|riccho: sandqvist followed the zia rules and bid not only 1@h but raised to 2@s (Bd12) -1 |pg||
nt|riccho: -1 after partner bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia is allowed to pass 1@s if partner will be declarer in four, but partner is not allowed to pass if Zia will be declarer in four|pg||
nt|400 volt: the 4@D bid came from piekarek|pg||
nt|400 volt: we obviously shouldn't compliment our operator so early :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks comfortable - may make five|pg||
nt|400 volt: :) :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||
nt|bobh1: when both of the opps have bid, if feel like a sitting duck bidding 1N with this hand|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, probably 6C. E will lay down club ace. then NS can both get style points for playing the jack and queen :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only thing known about West hand [without peeking] is that he is Game Force, but not @S fit with shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think this system is designed for E to need to know anything about W hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "pragmatic" 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner needs very right cards for 6|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kareno: An accurate route to the excellent slam is found by B/K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z, laughing, "invitation"|pg||
nt|mamos: It's difficult to see much future in this match for the Belgians  --  really great  start for Cayne|pg||
nt|kareno: Last board of the set.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of great bridge to come.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now, Z has asked B to show him his hand, so he can claim. Then says something about smoking :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||
nt|lml: I never though of that before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 5@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|milton_se: may even make 6 if going for the Cs instead of D finesse ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: Thanks all|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... but he'll be content w two S ruffs|pg||
nt|400 volt: Other running scores are available at: http://tinyurl.com/2fuo3ng|pg||
nt|milton_se: thanks joe, mike, felix and all|pg||
