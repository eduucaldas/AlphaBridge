nt|sunsamvar: hi Jan and Cornelia|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi sunil|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: east west play polish club- 1 club with a 3-way meaning|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so we will see a lot of 1@C openings i presume|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: any one knows the NorthSouth system?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: any spectator?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=NF, 11-15 HCP, 4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|newmoon: wlc all, feel free to voice your opinions of system bids to me plse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play a homegrown Big Club with Canape|pg||
nt|bobholl: part score probably 1nt ew|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: id N doubles 1nt it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt making 8 tricks i predict :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x now is take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: good evening and welcome back to the World Bridge series, round robin, round 3 of 9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Bob|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levy not happy with his @H holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: willkommen Hedy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: in polish system 1 dia mostly promisses 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: what else as 2@H dangerous contract|pg||
nt|toral5: a dull 3nt to begin with|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/WomensTeams/germany/auken-vonarnim.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: running totals for all events   http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT was good/bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and you can spy on other tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess same result here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: north has 2 chances to lead his singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: somewhat aggressive 3NT by West, no invite|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: possibly 2 down if trump promotion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dec can ruff high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: on the 3rd @D ie|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that needs to play exactly 2 rounds of heart before|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not trump with 7 :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: but East has a maximum, and 3NT looks fairly certain to make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry running a bit late here |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: 9 tricks are easy, with the @s position can make more|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 3 @s tricks possible|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Hedy,   I think 2N=5+@D and 4+@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: why not 7 of @D (they reverse perhaps)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: ok.. i will check|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 3@C would have been longer @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :(|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: well over X they play transfers but over 2@H as well?|pg||
nt|hedyg: also seems like an overbid if not good/bad|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: sry this is normal|pg||
nt|newmoon: from time to time, I will also tell you what the PAR (best result) is on boards, assuming best declarer play and best defense.  But this is a double-dummy analysis|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: but these ladies are agressive bidders|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: defence right on the ball|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 10@s can be a trick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so is declarer|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: well good would be in context of big club -- but as you say  they are agressive -- especially with distribution|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sharkey: EW can make 3@S|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm- let NS play the hand in 4@H |pg||
mb|1H!|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe 4@H & 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 2 with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: in 4@H|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2S|nt|vicky888: 2d showing good raise|pg||
nt|milton_se: transfer raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: lots of trumps at least :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: the german women bid 'em up -- especially with shape|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: when Kushari played 2007 Bermuda Bowl with other partners  he used upside-down count & attitude  i don't have CC for Laitu|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: East opened 2@S CR (assuming some Tartan type) - must admit 1st hand opening rather paltry|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i'm told incorrect spelling of East's name   should be   Laltu   [ell not eye]|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonder what that bodes for set |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back to Paul Orth|pg||
nt|pauleger: hi all :)|pg||
nt|toral5: hi|pg||
nt|newmoon: PAR is 3@S= by e/w, and n/s can make 3@H here|pg||
mb|2S|an|!|nt|hedyg: EW play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many @D from west??|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: looks like easy game here|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: not as easy as with a 1NT opening :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S will not play well,  and 3 nt is a bit iffy also |pg||
nt|wstuart: that was meant to be a question, "you know him?" but I forgot teh punctuation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: seems weak 2's by e/w = 5xM and 4xm combination|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: next question -- which is best   1@H or 2N to show 2-lowest|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 11-13 if balanced|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|toral5: south has to cash out at the earliest|pg||
nt|newmoon: this treatment is getting more popular all the time|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: everything lays perfect for declarer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt open 1 no with 5 solid hearts and 3 small spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 17 with a good 5 carder is too strong for 1 nt in my book. what say u ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: depends on your agreements on what your 2suiter bids show, weak, medium or strong?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit strong that's for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: this sequence is better|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you miss a heart contract to often i thk, i woudnt mind the strenth, since the jack of dia is not a great card|pg||
nt|chick: rebid is the problem ... 1@H, P 1@S, then what?   2!N showing 18+?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes i wd upgrade to 18|pg||
nt|bobholl: would bid 2@C if opening 1@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and sat as many of us would |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is natural..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Vic :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Paul  :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|frankaus: this could have got ugly for EW |pg||
nt|toral5: is 2@S muiderberg?|pg||
nt|pauleger: i am already looking for their cc|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: whatever you bid, it's a lie ... that's why 1N is better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: also i like to bid my 6card major|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: g'day vic|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria produces many fine players and is now a major challenger in Europe|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, and these 2 are among their finest|pg||
nt|chick: if you had 4 clubs, then I would agree with you|pg||
nt|toral5: south should cash out now..else....|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the Open Room, we have Sabine Auken and Daniela von Armin  n/s resp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i also factor in @S length -- then randomly pick overcall vs 2-suited bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: partner as passed hand also confuses my decision making|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Wayne |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|odysseus69: Chagas has been a champion for ever. I Dont know whether this is a regular partnership|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now comm problems solved|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: i think they make 1 less in this room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: at the other table Piekarek is in 8@S  [4@SX]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which brings up our auction    East DBL probably 4+@S   West DBL probably 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov in West bid 3@S over Hemant Lall's 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Auken really thinking here?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: this is a very new partnership created just for this |pg||
nt|hedyg: Michel and Thomas Bessis their teammates at the other table|pg||
nt|pauleger: yes, its 5+@s, 4+min|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|9|nt|vicky888:  if he starts a club now will take all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: kaplan rubens tell us that hand is worth 18,10 points|pg||
nt|pauleger: E/W playing baltic club|pg||
nt|newmoon: The 2 girls recently played in the Buffet Cup (bridge's equivalent of the Ryder Cup)|pg||
nt|toral5: tnk u paul|pg||

mb|1S|an|4+|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 10-15 HCP, 4+@S, maybe longer @C/@D, not 4@H & 4@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: N will show a 3 card invitational raise later by Neg X first|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vicky888: at least two down on dia lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: and this is why the bid 'em up     so often defense helps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: but is @C lead enough??|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: 4-1 @S break is trouble though|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: right|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if she reads west to hold exactly !Qxx and @SA/K singleton ....|pg||
nt|sharkey: with @DA lead and ruff E wud give up natural trump trick - I think @C lead best for defence|pg||
nt|milton_se: ruff C now|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: oohhh big board|pg||
nt|hedyg: Danailov did well not to disc @d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|anton72: could u explain for us this move from S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C, usually no 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: S was dummy, she didnt move|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kdr_fm: 7@H looks good|pg||
nt|newmoon: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades here.   But they me tempted to try for game|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall will also open 2@C since they play a form of Precision|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be on their way with a raise of @H's |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will u bid the 6 carder @S suit as 1 @S 2@S or pass ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead 3NT no chance but will he find it|pg||
nt|newmoon: But they may be...|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: how ever they do it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: singleton spade is big - if N can get a spade cue from south at some point ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door Townsend and Gold who were Englands leading pair in Bejing are now a dissolved partnership but fulfilling all engagements|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now X i would have passed a reopening ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spade?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: with a @D king wastage he still accepted|pg||
nt|newmoon: e/w must ensure 2 @Ds and at least 2 trumps|pg||
nt|toral5: wt if he escapes a @D lead and guesses trump correctly?|pg||
nt|pauleger: difficult lead for W|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: 5@C has chances|pg||
nt|newmoon: the small from doubleton is popular in Norway, and Leif-Erik Stabell lives in Zimbabwe now and has popularised it here|pg||
nt|pauleger: declearer might try a @c to the K @h to the table and throw a @d on @cA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: yes 5@C is the best contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: if she can ruff out the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in heated auction Lalls get to 6@C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@c bidding out the shape - so a sing Spade is indicated|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow unlike Chagas|pg||
nt|bobholl: i stop @S and you ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they will try 3 no and go 4 off|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toral5: looks like making|pg||
nt|pauleger: with trumps breaking 4-1 i think he will get forced out of trumps on that line of play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kdr_fm: possible 3@C is a cue ... we'll see|pg||
nt|sybarra: but question is is the @D bid viewed as cue |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 off|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he does, West ruffs 3rd @H with ace, and with no entry to dummy left, South has to play trumps from hand, losing a further 2 trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: 2 off i guess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kdr_fm: there is the 3@s cue now N is off|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N will ask,  then ask for extra, such as K |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Norths pass meant as more encouraging than immediate 3 hearts. I expect Townsend-Gold to reach game|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levy bid his hand strongly even though he knew that KJ@S not worth much..|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the @D K isn't rigth in a doubleton|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: oh well,  just bid it!|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think Levy can bid more than 2@s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: South hand will be no surprise I think |pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|kdr_fm: @s + ruff.  @SJ will be worrying ..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Townsend just bashed 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s-2@H-p-4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would go 2 off but if he tries to make 4 off|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: counting points now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  he will try to make by giving dia|pg||
nt|vicky888:  and down4|pg||
nt|newmoon: East does not have to take a chance of being overruffed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|toral5: wt if he had ruffed 3rd @C and than low @H?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess is the bets play in imp|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes you do worry  |pg||
nt|bobholl: best|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well west need the @Sa for his vul overcall and east needs it for his 2@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: Being non-vulnerable is the cause of many missed games - the 250 bonus is not enough to sway on marginals|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pauleger: I think he couldn´t have made it anyway. Just with a clublead, on which he has one more entry to dummy to lead @s towards his hand|pg||
nt|toral5: say west ruffs 3rd @H,cashes @D ace and EXITS with @D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: thought he would ruff with 10  to be safe |pg||

nt|odysseus69: 5D ok |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 di or 3 no?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if they use rkc properly|pg||

mb|d|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how good Allegaert needs to be to open in 1st seat|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interestingly, he now lives in my home town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.|pg||
nt|sybarra: PSZCZOLA   those are not the letters we usually see in that order|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is 2@S muderberg style ?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: suction bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they play suction over 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right, I think 2@H is supposed to be Suction  a) @S  b) @C & @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some mixed raise?|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh |pg||
nt|bobholl: polish is at least 55|pg||
nt|newmoon: in either minor, it takes a @S-lead to hold n/s to 11, else +1|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bg: Deutsch have qualified for round robin Pinot noir are in 2nd place only need a reasonable result to qualify|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will survive as @S is 3-3|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt is making|pg||
nt|toral5: but do u agree with 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S LR+ I would say.|pg||
nt|toral5: even though partner is a balancer,2c seems highly conservative to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: 2S Michaels- some now play as hearts and specific minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Suction is a favorite treatment in New Zealand over strong 1@C/2@C and some use it over 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any option that doesn't need @S finesse?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @CQ coming down and endplay in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ruff out @ss and same hand has Kx in @D and Q@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: or Qx in @c and K@D on side.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hadn't thought about guessing @DKx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my sliderule tells me -- just take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier when we see the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: it means the bee in polish (his name)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now offering choice of games between 3NT and 4@H.|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be they will survive and gain an imp :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: yes a little lucky 4 spade here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: peeking at the hands confirms that :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: most as hearts and minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: they have 13 VPs more than the 5th team|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pauleger: I think I would have bid 3@c directly|pg||
nt|toral5: this surely should be a gain for josef and cards|pg||
nt|toral5: even direct 3c on 1@S is ok.but 2@C is something to much on dbl|pg||
nt|newmoon: a bit conservative by South here.   3@C first time would certainly help|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, P|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: Weird 4@D bid by Caputo.|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding in other room much better but lose 1 imp (they found @D and checked on keycards)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: smart switch|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt was easier?|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|kdr_fm: 3NT lucky with the 4/4 @C split makes 9 tricks - 4@h looks like a make with the @DQ dropping|pg||

pc|d6|nt|wstuart: From one of our specs:  "PSZCZOLA pronounceed [pshchowah] means bee"|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: pray and play @S i guess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|newmoon: a jump bid in response to partner's t/o double = good 7 - bad 11.  2@C is thus a gross underbid, notwithstanding partner is in balancing seat|pg||

nt|hedyg: ahhhhh that is a great explanation|pg||
nt|pauleger: Josef and Cards closing the gap|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  1N-2@C//2@D  says not 4@H, maybe 4@S    [2@H=4@H and maybe 4@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am still looking for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe an Ace was hidden|pg||
nt|hedyg: sticky cards?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: what is a packet sunil?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: E/W philosopy is no invites it seems.  Vul in teams probably fair enough, otherside rates to bid em|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they play the hands well,  so add a point or 2 |pg||
nt|pauleger: trailing only by 8 imps now|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib suggests that 3@C is some form of Jacoby raise and they use 2NT for something else|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky to find a @H picture or even xx @H with partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 3c=14 plus w 4 s|pg||
nt|newmoon: missing game on previous board resulted in 6-IMP swing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: now 4@D|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx operator|pg||
nt|pauleger: I think Auken - von Arnim´s auction will take much longer :)|pg||
nt|toral5: thts wt i thought;a strong raise to @S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: 9 HCP, 2 4 card suits which might come in, 5:3 IMP odds and one of teh finest declarers on the planet playing the hand.  I'd give it a shot.  ;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kdr_fm: he has alot of work here|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: he cant even get to dummy to lead the @hQ to tempt a cover :<|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suppose he didnt want to duck the club with @D coming back?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is tough on N going up the ace could be so wrong if declarer has say KJxx|pg||
nt|wstuart: His best shot:  tangling the @H entries|pg||
nt|wstuart: North knows south started with about 8HCP - so, one entry out of the KQ@D he is knokwn to hold.  Where is that card is what he is wondering.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: so over 2@H which does not deny 4@s she decided to play 3 NT?|pg||

nt|toral5: @D ace gone|pg||

nt|odysseus69: tiger lead - but not the set up Chagas hoped for|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wstuart: Interesting here, is that east's 4@D bid isn't a slam try in this situation.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If west had a singleton C he'd have a tough bid with all cards working - probably make up a 4@H bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right -- i missed if @S 3-1 then always down|pg||
nt|pauleger: and I can make a move|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  the advantage of 2@S is that it's forcing and p might bid 3@c or you can pattern out your hand nicely if he bids 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: contents|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 of dia asking for a high color- cant be spade..|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec ak10 on the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not quite impossible :) but indeed improbable|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops.   Now he will play a trump to dummy, instead of dble-finessing off table|pg||
nt|pauleger: yes, if 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, agree|pg||
nt|mrdct:  might go for a bit of a cross-ruff here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: leading pds "suit"|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

pc|sK|nt|newmoon: or establish @Ss|pg||
nt|pauleger: GIB says it´s down now|pg||
nt|newmoon: y|pg||
nt|mrdct:  he couldn't afford to be tapped a second time before he's established a @S trick|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he ducks @SA, makes.   Ruffs and all trumps make separately|pg||
nt|newmoon: after 3@Cs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as the cards lie (and as was evident from the auction) there is sort of trump coup position against east as you can pitch a @S on third round of @C and lead a top spade through east's trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: Remember, at this stage East is unsure if declarer started with 6 or 5 trumps only|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it has to be right to keep going with @D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: and gawrys will think that too|pg||
nt|mrdct:  undo that comment|pg||
nt|newmoon: a @D now, and he makes.  @D, @S, 3@Cs, and trumps make separately|pg||
nt|mrdct:  trump is best|pg||

nt|mrdct:  might see this auction push to the 5-level with NS' double fit in the red suits|pg||

nt|odysseus69: still conservative by Chagas -|pg||

nt|newmoon: probably solidish minor|pg||

nt|newmoon: 4@C pass or correct?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: 1N=7-10 and as you see can have 4 card major since 1@D usually DENIES 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: what would you bid?|pg||
nt|bg: nothing like a flat hand to stir things up|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks like a 2NT bid from here|pg||

mb|4D|nt|wstuart: Obviously, none of us are what they ARE playing, but we are sure that it is not Polish @C.  |pg||
nt|mrdct:  north may have been better bidding 4@d pass/correct as he wouldn't be too unhappy playing in 5@C if south has @C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes.  4@Cx is too revealing|pg||
nt|newmoon: and yes, 5@C also makes, Paul|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@Dx is only -2... |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: landen is wondering if he needs to underlead his spades|pg||

nt|sharkey: Kibs may wonderhow EW cud play in 2@Hx CR - it's sooo much easier looking at all 4 hands...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H with 4@H & 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: systemically 1@H could also be 4@H with 5+@C/@D  or 5+@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not many pairs left, except in UK, who open with 4 card Majors|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=RELAY  game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4@H 4@S (41)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Both 4@S and 3 NT playable I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = RELAY|pg||
nt|milton_se: y shouldn't be any problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then Auken will know full shape   probably settling for 3N|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sharkey: May just bid 4@S to show minimum?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: must ask   no reason partner couldn't be  4441@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|alert|mb|p|nt|sharkey: fair point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes only go as far as 3N :(|pg||
nt|sharkey: no alerts beyond 3 NT Al..|pg||
nt|sharkey: appreciate your insight|pg||
nt|sharkey: as far as I know they're playing with screens and all bids are alertable - compared to playing without screens|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sharkey: OK 6@S CR - where do we end up here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have a number of auctions where a bid is "optional KC"  or  "scan"  with a lower bid a signal to bid next suit so i can signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C actually does fit   Optional Keycard for @S  saying  max with 0/3 keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but that is a pure guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken should DBL Kushari's 4@S :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sharkey: undo pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S even more so|pg||
nt|milton_se: hard to beleive that Sabine made a slam-try w those trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and opposite the singleton @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|milton_se: so 4H was prolly meant KC|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: 36-0 last four boards for Josef & Co if they can make this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: but response would be Optional Keycard  -- in pure RKC you must answer  in optional you can reject the ask OR respond with good hand for the auction|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S in the other room so which swing will we see?|pg||
nt|milton_se: sorry, meaning to say "not meant"|pg||
nt|sharkey: Look forward to an exiting final segment - the break probably very timely for Dhampur as they need to regroup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- score already posted |pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminder   last set begins in 30 minutes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: at the end of the next 14 boards -- winners advance  losers find another event|pg||

nt|newmoon: was a costly 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: x was to|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Some badly needed IMPs for Mahaffey.  We have a tight race now.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c now for EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: slamtime!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pauleger: but that´s a thing, which is discussed here plenty of times. What the X specifically shows (does it promise some extra defence against 2@h or not)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: oh oh they will surely bid it now |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i might have bid 3 dia with north|pg||
nt|bobholl: then he would have an easy 4@D bid what now i don't know |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be 5 dia:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the polish @C is dificult now :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be asking aces?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: afraid to lose an ace and a @H|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2NT is the normal takeout in that situation|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: pollack not liking this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose you double and pray|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: costly misunderstanding for team Dhampur|pg||
mb|3H|nt|odysseus69: back to back slams|pg||
nt|bg: interesting started 1 spade not 1 club maybe systemic problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 @c is 16+|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play precision|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strong club|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Bulgaria/karakolev-danailov.pdf|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far so good |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or just 6, which i dont like- but never argue against sucess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: here he seems to be hoping landen has seven clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or hearts double stopped|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we hear all the tme - "good hand for stronfg club" - I find myself saying "bad hand for strong club"|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: fast claim|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and the long hand getting the tap |pg||
nt|bg: I think E has to keep bidding  otherwise a systemic weakness|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: P has enough if he has a 12-14 NT so ?!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: He'll be short a trick..  He could try blocking hearts but that still gets him only 8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East has done well or got lucky -|pg||
nt|bobholl: his @H posession is bad |pg||
nt|bobholl: if w has @D points they are wasted|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with ace of dia instead of the king of hearts a nice, but difficult to bid grand|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than in need of a singleton @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: yes a 4144|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play @S iso @C :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it looks as if we are waiting for the boards to come from the other table, is that correct?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i mean the results, sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: were they playing 14 or 16 boards ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 14 he said! so all over, 3 more sessions to come|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thx all for watching!|pg||
nt|bobholl: if i rember rigth it was 14 so tya :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT scrambling|pg||
nt|wstuart: Why didn't west bid 1@D 0-6?|pg||
nt|newmoon: perhaps an immediate 2@C by South (not forcing to game in competition) would have solved everything|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wstuart: So it is official, they are playing a stdish system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: if the @S were 3/3 onside he'd make at this point - pitch a @h on this and the @Ck|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bg: both|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have bid 2@c with the W hand and that would have gotten us there fast|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: if he believes the lead blocking hearts is a serious option|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: 6@S makes double-dummy.   Tougher when playing|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for those who don't now West -- if memory serves  Jaggy's first time playing in the United States led to a rousing victory in the 1987 Reisinger Teams  on a team that included 4 ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players from 4 different countries  [Jaggy India, Zia Pakistan, Billy Cohen Canada, Ron Smith USA ]|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: but i digress|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: easier to make 6@S if first trump played is the 9 off table|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: no|pg||
nt|pauleger: east would play low |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: now he may go down three|pg||
nt|newmoon: that's ok... pins the 7.   1 trump loser only|pg||
nt|pauleger: but would you really play low from hand?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room South in 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: if she plays A@H and @H there is a possible trump promotion|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have thought so.  The lead AND the auction suggest a heart honor in north.|pg||
nt|newmoon: lol   that's why I said double-dummy.    Tough hand, I admit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: would "time out" for declarer |pg||
nt|bg: I agree Hedy 2 clubs is a good call firstly it is a game force and secondly it allows par to make a normal rebid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that the right Queen?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if she plays Q@H she wins for sure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|nt|newmoon: kib reports: "Sementa played @s to 8 for 12 tricks"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: It's a gutsy play to block the suit...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: welcome Karen :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: very well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: Thanks, Martin :)|pg||

nt|pauleger: thx bye all!|pg||
nt|newmoon: hope you enjoyed, all   @H|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 14:  OR stopped in sensible 5@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: in a contract of FIVE, run @S9 better?|pg||
