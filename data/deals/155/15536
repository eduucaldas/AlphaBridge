nt|kdr_fm: anyone have a link for the running scores ? I tried the website earlier nothing up bar the mixed ... ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well fantun has eliminated the the losing diamond hook but down 3 another way|pg||
nt|kareno: It was the Miami endplay.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i want to know what he has, ot describe my hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not|pg||
nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi all nice close match|pg||
nt|mamos: and an exciting hand to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: russino first lead and suit of partner and suit on table. EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Hi all and welcome.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|?|nt|ahollan1: at this vul  1N would be 14-16    why 1@H instead of 1@D like earlier hand??   i wish i knew|pg||
nt|kareno: Famous play - you put them in and they take the rest of the tricks :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|wstuart: 5@D is a nice contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why Miami|pg||
nt|bobholl: will he bid 5 @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Artificial Game Force|pg||
mb|p|an|shows 3|nt|wstuart: but the 4-1 @D will give it probelms.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ok specs sending me swanbridge site & bridgewinners.com thx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bg: board 11 did not bid 6 dia either|pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|mgchat: ah ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: anything can be good in these situations|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: what do we think about 4 spade bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, I suspect it has to do with the number of retirees who live there and it is a bit prejudiced on the strength of their game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: typical fredin :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: South should clearly RDBL here, not 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: questionalbe pass by landen|pg||
nt|kareno: Let me quickly add that it was not so named by me.  I first heard of it in about 1969!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lack of any fast tricks suggests 4@H to me|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: for those just joining us.  Alerts are not always described during the auction.  I will do my best to record any explaination provided at the end of the bidding.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I believe EW may be playing a Polish Club system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: do we have to reply?|pg||
nt|toral5: terrible trump break here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: up to you Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: I would XX |pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead and the entry is burned at once.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|wstuart: RDBL will show the A, pard will be in a position to judge if the single stopper is right for his intentions in any contract at any level.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT might keep them out of a slam or misjudge whether 3NT or 5@D is a better strain.|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs a few good guesses here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|reisig: one "guess" goes away fast|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Rich|pg||
nt|sybarra: RR  @H|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya :) :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that didnt paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|reisig: Shirl @H|pg||
nt|reisig: When the 4@d show up ..the @s becomes easy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bg: questionable if 4 spades is a good bid then 4 hearts will not be a good bid result wise with 4 trumps and two aces I would probably let them play 4 hearts|pg||

nt|hedyg: not home yet|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: we know from the GREAT showing in a couple of events this year, that Bessis pretty close to French Standard|pg||
nt|afulton: Looks like some sort of strong @c system by NS ... |pg||
nt|spooky: 6@S needed a @D lead to beat it.. this will be over soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: all matches playing same boards|pg||
nt|spooky: Looks like a strong club indeed, otherwise 2@S would be an underbid :)|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: you have to lead something.  heart did not sound right from the auction :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: this is very interesting     I think the @H shift and continuation will defeat 2 tricks|pg||

nt|mamos: and a close hand|pg||

nt|spooky: A brave 4@H bid by South here, but I don't see another bid for south now |pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty common for big clubber to use "Michaels" rebid in the given auction -- so @H & @C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: no problm at all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: I think you need about 29-30 HCP to make 3N in a total misfit|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I suppose there is a missing pass from W|pg||
nt|passell: interesting hand slam without a dia lead game could go down with k of dia lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D asking for 3 card spade support, 4@C splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|passell: hi ralf|pg||
nt|chick: Operator, should this be 4@H in the North?|pg||
nt|passell: in slam percentage to pick up hearts  with the king of dia lead declarer will have to guess hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If decclarer takes a @c ruff in dummy, @hQ will be found easily|pg||
nt|chick: no, but if he takes a club ruff, then can pitch all diamonds on spades|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will lead dia king|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS convention card from 2008 European Championships    http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Austria/fischer-saurer.pdf|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: the occasional hand that makes 3N on fortunate lie of cards does make 3N a good bet :)|pg||
nt|chick: does NOT* make 3N a good bt|pg||
nt|afulton: 5@c was going -1, this is at least -2 |pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|chick: yes, most hands like these should be passed as cheaply as possible, as soon as the massive misfit is known|pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense needed to stop the timely entries to dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: very difficult|pg||

mb|d|nt|sybarra: welcome to Daniel Gulyas |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: are NS playing a weak 1N?|pg||

nt|toral5: 3nt coming up for ns|pg||
mb|2N|an|?|nt|chick: I'm sure the operator will enter the correct result when s/he gets time :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S - intermediate 10-13|pg||
nt|toral5: but a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: seems they must be|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: 2@D is most likely a @H raise|pg||
nt|passell: yes  now the club fit will ensure the good save|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H michaels like, showing @D+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: no one knows who can make what now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 in 5@c as well as in 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: board 17 was 4 H e w down 1|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@S is any4441 8+|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they did lead the dia king and misguessed hearts|pg||
nt|riccho:  lebensohl standard I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like 1-under reply to show 1@S|pg||
nt|afulton: cute... if @s split 3-3, this would make 6 (losing just 1@h trick) |pg||
nt|spooky: south might set for 4@S now..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may just try 4@S now unless they can determine total honors/extra high card points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with that arsenal, Saurer MAY make one more ASK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was going to say -- i hadn't considered 3N --- but Arline's  "oops"  probably more accurate|pg||
nt|spooky: even an overtrick if he cashes @D first|pg||

nt|bobholl: unlucky result for sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|riccho:  might be|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other room Levy [playing with Chagas]  opened Saurer's hand 2@C!!|pg||

nt|toral5: i meant opening:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: thats stander french Al, any semi-forcing|pg||

nt|toral5: @C suit might get eaten away|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: 2 @H p 2 @S end?|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H depends on @H finesse (which works here)|pg||
nt|bobh1: a 2-way guess|pg||
nt|chick: true, you could go wrong :)|pg||
nt|afulton: NT?? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  so French  2@C covers  old Acol 2@D/@H/@S  and 2@D is the Game Force|pg||
nt|spooky: indeed Al :)|pg||
nt|spooky: Levy had 8 tricks didn't he? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've written that down, so it's official|pg||
nt|afulton: Does bidding NT imply there is stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: cos west can bid @s many times|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: N likes his hand but.... |pg||
nt|spooky: south knows his partner it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: where will this end?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S as half-stopper good bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: will b pass ?|pg||
nt|toral5: 2 trumps and @C for the defense.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|spooky: if South bids 4@C now it might be the end of the auction, |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: not sure East should pull that|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: I wonder if that 2@H bid should be 2@D (new minor forcing) or if they have some variation of it going|pg||
nt|spooky: I dont think North is a GF opposite a 10-15|pg||
nt|afulton: hmmmm... what will they do when Thomas puts his hand on spade?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree with comments that North hand doesn't look like GF -- just quoting their 2008 Convention Card|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand the auction.  Did East bid 3@H as a game try?|pg||
nt|stewball: 3@h is non sensical|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am not sure what 3@H showed either|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no alert|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: E is now hoping the @hs are foul|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably better for declarer not taking a tap right of way |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|warrens:  I'm guessing he meant it as a last train try for 4@S|pg||
nt|stewball: then he should be playing with himself:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spooky: -3 and next board|pg||
nt|warrens:  He can't have 2@S's and 4-5@H's, since he bid 2@S the first time|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|chick: ummm,  operator, are we sure this is right? :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: is that why he played the suit the "wrong way"|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c9|nt|sybarra: not that is watching the spot cards!!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: brackets were defined magically using WBF points and Round Robin results|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I cant promise to get all the discards right, especially in 4th seat.  Sometimes they get turned over too quickly.  Disclaimer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: declarer let a suit in which he had a 2-way guess and roth's partner fiddled, inducing the declarer to misguess|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: but when he did misguess roth ducked his Q|pg||

nt|bobh1: when the client asked later why he had ducked, roth said "I thought you had it"|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: should get no higher than 2NT here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chick: X is probably SOS since they are playing weak NTs|pg||
nt|chick: fit showing jump,  clubs+spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about 4@d from W?|pg||
nt|chick: that would make E happy :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all KO matches  4 segments of 14 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: not sure why S wants to run|pg||
nt|sharynr: but may make more anyway|pg||
nt|mamos: the actio at this table so far has been fast furious and perhaps a little less than accurate|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: Q's say "notrump" to me|pg||
nt|chick: I would, vul :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: u could easily be hopping out of the frying pan into the fire|pg||
nt|spooky: this misfit will end in 3NT I guess|pg||
nt|afulton: As I understand it, seating was also predetermined by WBF points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C instead of 2@D  -- can someone explain that to me?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|?|nt|sybarra: I am told that N is by far the youngest on the team |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also defeat 5@s|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@D =4+ @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I must say I know very little about either pair |pg||
nt|spooky: @C suit is better, and you can probably relay|pg||
mb|3N|nt|toral5: say north responds 1@S.wt is souths rebid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: Perhaps, but often the opps will be more likely to defend 1NX than to double 2 of a minor for penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: after a @h support from E, I think that 4@d is a superior bid|pg||
nt|chick: Certainly if you are going to bid again, but apparently W didn't want to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Some specs will lead @hK! agree, a nice lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: e pulled K of H then put it back|pg||
nt|chick: if he had led it, would clearly switch to diamond at trick 2, but still doesn't beat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: w thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but after that EW has taken their 3 red tricks, there can be a guess in  trumph|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT alerted on 1 side, but not the other..  |pg||
nt|toral5: eisenberg will pick up another 10 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: unfortunately, I can not see the writing on the far side.  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: 16 17 gave the Swedes 18 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they open ligth they 'll know to stop in 3@C or 2@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@C probably forces 2@d so East can show an invitational hand with 5 @h's|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: so not systemic|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: but the @H are terribly positioned|pg||
nt|toral5: @S 9 is a gold card|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|chick: sure, and when one of the QJ falls, he may take the restricted choice finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now n thinking|pg||
nt|chick: Running scores here:  http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|chick: The danger of course is that a diamond switch is obvious if the spade finesse fails, so maybe he will just go for the drop|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: this 2@C was NOT automatic game force|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot to do for declarer and both black suits breaking badly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chagas-Levy stopped in 3@C on 19 [our 3N down 3]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kasimir-Jokish bidding this hand now   wonder if they'll stop in 3N|pg||
nt|afulton: frankly, Al, I've been looking at East hand... don't see any reason for 2@c v 2@d ... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw - Jokish also responded 2@C   but that was game force relay|pg||
nt|afulton: other than 2@d will make auction easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can imagine -- only like @D if partner bids them first and @C soo much better|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Oosman Bashir|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: and of course what you really want at that point is for the opps to rescue you :)|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|toral5: hello osmanji:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bell & Byrne are a young and very promising pair from Manchester England|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: If declarer plays on @s3-1 he has to play on @c and go down|pg||
nt|afulton: (after starting with 2@d, of course) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm sure at the table i would have bid 2@D without thinking about it  -- maybe that's why Bessis' more successful  [ok, one reason they're more successful]|pg||
nt|afulton: rofla|pg||
nt|spooky: I think its a bit a matter of partnership style too...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  3N west|pg||
nt|spooky: if partner knows you might not tell a 5crd suit, or bid any 5crd suit always, might change his bidding a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that this happens ONLY with @C & @D  otherwise show shape normally|pg||
nt|afulton: but if i tell partner I have 5@d's ... and he has said, "Oh I have 5@s's and 4@h's or more" do I really want to suggest @c??  |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hands with 100 honors are always nice -- i know from paying off to opponents in rubber bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Though she might be afraid of missing 4@H|pg||

nt|riccho:  what would u bid with E hand after: 1NT - 4@c - 4@h - p - p - ?|pg||
nt|toral5: with wests hand i m chopping eveything|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: west puts her hand down and asked was that natural|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|bobh1: fluky @h position|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @H goes away now for a nice pick up|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: not sure of systems,  but unlikely I make a neg X |pg||
nt|sybarra: but landed well |pg||
nt|lml: I  know slam is a poor contract but maybe West should go slower?|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh right the @c pitches are sufficient|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice 5@H from dad --  T couldn't bid 4@S because not enough extras after 3@H bid|pg||
nt|spooky: 4@H-2 on the previous board gained EW 3 imps, 3N-3 in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: the double makes it easier for E to bid 4@H which makes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 5 level safe with doubleton @S so 5@H tells partner about extras|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|bobholl: is the W hand good enough for 1 nt ?|pg||
nt|toral5: fireman took a nice save in @D.match might get closer here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think it'll get duplicated here|pg||
mb|2S|an|diamond raise|nt|mamos: 14-16 for this pair i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: north will cue bid 2@S, east 4@S ? |pg||
nt|toral5: ya.very likely|pg||
nt|toral5: why 4@S with east>?4333|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Now up to South, who might just devalue her @H holding|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Cue bid 3@d then?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: passed hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: hello Rado :)|pg||
nt|chick: that must be an agreement as a splinter in support of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: 12 tricks here also|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D and another probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: y|pg||
nt|toral5: or a simple 3@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I guess 3@S more descriptive :)|pg||
nt|toral5: see gromova can HEAR me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but loses 100 honors   [yes always back to that :)]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've always wondered what duplicate would be like if honor bonuses applied|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rado: N might bid more with nice distribution and @S honours only|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|sybarra: depending on system |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps they will compensate for their underbidding on the previous board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: just did that|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they reach a nice 3@C|pg||
nt|toral5: is 5@D making?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if @d position is read cant this be made?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: the dbl and two suited overcall does give alot away|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: i think they lose 2S and a diamond|pg||
nt|toral5: betr is play @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: system bids could range for 3 @s, 3 @D and the 2 @S he chose |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: true they could pick up the diamond suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: whn wests ATLEAST 2@C are known,@D dbl hook will be marked|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well if she does that, she'll win another deserved 10+ imps |pg||
pc|s5|nt|spooky: 3NT serious now? or what was 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  if 2@D didn't set up game force -- why was 3@S forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 3no was alerted|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H makes n/s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: slam also bid in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: Great, thanks, we now have the result on bd 17 :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|lml: this is a terrific slam as long as there is no spade ruff|pg||
nt|bobh1: not as good a slam as the previous board|pg||
nt|lml: well assuming the SA is onside it is pretty cold.|pg||
nt|lml: except for the ruff|pg||
nt|chick: and 3-2 hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but the ruff is fairly likely|pg||
nt|passell: looks like down 1 |pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: do you have to have 3-2 hearts.  I dont think so|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sure E is sweating bullets right now|pg||
nt|spooky: because invites you bid directly or via 2@C or so|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobholl: with repeated @C leads i don't think so :)|pg||
nt|toral5: rusinow leads in high level contracts|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: isn´t easts hand better in nt?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: oh -- so only 1M-2@C is not absolute game force, but 1M-2@D and 1@S-2@H are?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobh1: I mean S did double 5@s as well as overcalling in @ss earliet|pg||
nt|bobh1: r|pg||
nt|lml: you can still make it on a bad trump break by ruffing a diamond in the East hand|pg||
nt|lml: before playing the fourth trump|pg||
nt|lml: the ruff is the worst risk I think|pg||
nt|chick: interesting play by W at trick 1, concealing the @S2|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Sapan jee declarer never got in, they cashed 2@S and exited in dummy's singleton A@H|pg||
nt|toral5: now north has a real problm;is west @C single|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: restroom break..  South asks if anyone wants to go with her :)|pg||
nt|toral5: ohhh...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well the 2 suited overcall mightve given this away, in the other room West only introduced @S, so South had to play @D to ace, on the same defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: or from the bridgewinner site.  But both are really pointing to the scoring site.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they made 4@S on the strange 3@H from this room |pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosmanb: Nothing too exciting here, unless South gets excited|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: west could have bid 3clubs instead of 4 hearts to bring 3nt into play|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, a defensive error|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: this does not seem like an excitable bunch..  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|spooky: Thomas is not afraid for @S it seems...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I agree :) |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: which is also getting a lot of direct traffic from just about everyone|pg||
nt|chick: opinions vary greatly on how much you need for a negative double, but ignoring a 4 card major to preeempt in diamonds doesn't seem the best approach|pg||
mb|2S|an|?|nt|sharynr: 5@C with a club guess or 4@S...will they reach?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the D needed to lead @D's |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i find this a rather strange 1N overcall|pg||
nt|lml: in that it lacks a diamond stopper|pg||
nt|bobh1: to me it looks like a takeout double|pg||
nt|lml: ?|pg||
nt|chick: a takeout double may promise 4 in each major|pg||
nt|lml: on this particular hand a takeout double might get you in trouble|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s an idea. agree|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But a pretty bad shape dbl against a passed pd, so they're not afraid either|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: they play gazilli ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|passell: how do you guys feel about passing 3dia dbld here?|pg||
nt|chick: think they could beat it 800 worth?|pg||
nt|passell: diamond Q lead here will make it easy for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: West will bid 1H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: what now|pg||
nt|passell: 4spades was touch and go with any of the other 12 cards lead|pg||
nt|spooky: this was not the right timing for 3N|pg||
nt|oosmanb: gets them to a nice spot though|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What happena if N switches to @h|pg||
nt|passell: strange duck here also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and he did!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: more easy now, but a @h shift.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Im jumping around - so far at other tables I've seen 2@h on the 3-3 and Sam Lev played 2@d x'd on the 4-2 :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think 1NT will work better a lot of the time but I get your point|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: very questionable dbl by east.4333 hands especially against passed partners land in huge problems|pg||
pc|h8|nt|warrens:  if he plays N to have either the spade K or the club Q, he'll make.|pg||
nt|warrens:  but getting tapped twice will make him a little uncomfortable|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he has to try :)|pg||

nt|toral5: this match has decided NOT to give us even 1 push brd:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: i prefer doubling to bidding 1N because it brings your partner into the game|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another imp disappearing |pg||

nt|toral5: no @D guess osman aftr @C ace seen|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: asking about leads.. lead middle from 3|pg||
nt|toral5: dbl announces all missing hcps here|pg||

nt|chick: he will pay for it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|bobh1: plus i don't like to overcall 1N without somewhere to run to if they double|pg||
nt|chick: Bidding 1N gives your partner a pretty good picture of your hand and let's him/her make the decisions|pg||
nt|lml: well it is marginal either way and it did avoid the 3-3 in hearts on this particular occasion|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

nt|toral5: betr i relog.its jammed up|pg||
mb|2D|an|shows 6|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|spooky: guess this will end in 2@H for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N opener is always 14-16|pg||
mb|2S|an|asks for spade stopper|mb|p|nt|sybarra: perhaps the free wheeling youthful exuberance |pg||
nt|sybarra: N to hit this?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 5 @S?|pg||
mb|2N|an|shows spade stopper|nt|oosmanb: Fireman took the low road after a similar start|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: it is West thinking not South |pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Alan Shillitoe |pg||
nt|sybarra: He is familar with the e/w players |pg||
nt|sybarra: the up and coming  jrs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or I should say young pair |pg||
nt|the saint: Byrne and I will be NPC and Coach for the England U20s next week|pg||
nt|sybarra: the relationship of M Byrne to David?|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@S looks like an overbid opposite 11-13|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|the saint: Different spelling - Byrne vs Burn|pg||
nt|lml: Canada is in Division J and they were leading their division coming into this round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: duh |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all |pg||
nt|mamos: may well be -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Someone points out that NS are playing a big club, so the 1@D opening didn't even promise diamonds on that last hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I dont know why she stopped liking her loaded responder hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This looks like a decent spot|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|passell: another strange play here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hQ what else?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h10 with @hQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: at this point if the match ended now Canada would be leading the divison with  117 VP with Deutsch second with 109 and Pinot Noir 4th with 103|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|afulton: if North had @s, wouldn't she bid them after 1@h? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolations    a)  1N did not deny 4@S   b) they don't have a checkback mechanism|pg||
nt|bobholl: -1 most probably|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: will S firgure the wild distribution? |pg||
nt|passell: on the lie of the cards declarer could have made it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: actually he doesnt need to |pg||
nt|chick: 6@S, making 7 when the @S finesse works|pg||
nt|chick: only a club lead will make it scary|pg||
nt|lml: this is a decent slam a bit better from the South side but that might be a challenge in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Arline - that's a partnership style issue      Rodwell swears by bid 1@S regardless of hand type   others say 1@S shows unbal hand [bid 1N and rely on checkback with 4@S bal]|pg||
nt|spooky: i would play @H to the jack and @CQ, maybe thats to easy?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is possible that 2@S was artificial|pg||
nt|afulton: just asking questions I get asked :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: not alerted|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: 6NT from south is very good|pg||
nt|lml: well from either hand really|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks good|pg||
nt|warrens:  if the defense plays one more round of trump (when in with the @H Ace), he'll take 4 @C's, 2@S + 2@H's for -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D @S squeeze not quite possible|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: may not feel the same at the table given the bidding |pg||
nt|chick: either way, need reasonably favorable spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toral5: now the screen is ok:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm getting questions why South didnt bid 1@H over dbl. Was there any alert Alice? I know some play all 10+ bal thru rdbl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Welcome back Sapan jee|pg||
nt|oosmanb: another big board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no alert on the XX |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|the saint: Bidding the single suiter rather than doubling worked well for NS here. Once North knew of the spade fit he was prepared to bid 5 over 5|pg||

nt|toral5: pass or dbl?|pg||

nt|sharynr: this appears t be the limit of the hand|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sybarra: is this a mix up of some sort? |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now south more at ease has this atleast -1 in her hand |pg||
nt|oosmanb: not much declarer can do here|pg||
nt|toral5: how was the idea of leading low @H frm hand at trick 2?|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr the dbl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: a pretty good one I think, South has alteast A10xx so it cant cost|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|toral5: tht play wd have changed the fate of the contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: fredin always creates excitement :)|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|oosmanb: but gains against A107xx right?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|the saint: Not really. I think Micky (Bell) wanted to show some possible interest and Byrne having bottom end just bid game in his longest suit expecting a little more in spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: I would think 3 @C says you chose |pg||
nt|bobholl: someone has to switch to @S in time|pg||
nt|warrens:  not a great start, but a spade shift will kill do the trick|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|toral5: i thing i know is LOW will NEVER cost aftr the dbl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: singleton 10 with @H, unlikely?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  will do the trick|pg||
nt|oosmanb: with N|pg||

pc|d7|nt|tez: sry.hi:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  welcome|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: assuming NS use strongish NT, N has bid this hand quite conservatively. an opening 1N has a flaw, but it seems to express the potential of the hand better than this sequence. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partner is hardly going to raise with, for example:  JT9x   xx   Axxx  KQx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: he'll delay as long as possible but it all comes down to finding @HA onside|pg||

nt|the saint: The penny drops...|pg||
nt|rado: anyway NS should avoid 5 level|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a clear 1N respoonse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, private|pg||
nt|chick: Peter, did the 1@H (showing spades) also deny 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|spooky: 2NT from North or 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 for me|pg||
nt|toral5: commonly used defense against multi is transfer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and that hand was better than East's right now :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: now their @S are lost i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: but @D outrank @C too|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@C is clubs or balanced (weak/strong)|pg||
nt|toral5: but ths dbl looks like @D|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@H on guessing the lady|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so it looks like NS play weak NT, probably invalidating my earlier comment|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, NS play strong club, weak NT|pg||
nt|chick: at least S won't be distressed at that bid|pg||
nt|spooky: as we saw this complete segment, NS bid aggresive :)|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H i mean|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yes|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But wont be bid I think|pg||
nt|toral5: ew can bid 3@H cos @D values are announced with ns|pg||
nt|toral5: also @C finesse likely to be in|pg||
nt|oosmanb: All 3 of those matches very exciting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: S opening 1@S N bidding 2@D probabvly:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps the guide book will help us on the hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: think we are missing a pass operator |pg||
nt|the saint: Specs need to rotate themselves 90 degrees|pg||
nt|sharynr: with dbl responsive, should not lose the @S fit|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Zimmerman 48 - 42 Camberos      Coldea  71- 74 Lavazza     Vito 47-55 Josef & Cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: at present|pg||
mb|3H|an|asks for major|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N very understandable - especially VUL|pg||
nt|spooky: this is abou the overtricks, @CQ won't be a problem and @DK is onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: last auction was correct|pg||
nt|sharynr: but this is a reasonable spot nonetheless|pg||
nt|toral5: strange tht two off the title favourites zimmerman and lavazza having a tough time|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: except that operator will have difficult time leading and playing this hand |pg||
nt|the saint: VG - NS and EW are mixed up|pg||
nt|sybarra: as in "impossible" |pg||
nt|chick: rkc turns out not to be very helpful here ... they will seem to be off 2 keycard|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: s writing note to w|pg||

nt|chick: Peter, you are teammates with EW at times, right?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes unlucky for them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but:  no @D filler,  probably @C length in East|pg||
nt|spooky: it's understandable, but does south never have KQJ109 of @D and a random Q?|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: I sympathise, as a VG operator it is an easything to do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: Pinot Noir got 6 imps on the last board when East-West played 2HX|pg||

nt|pitiful:  see how far they have to go...|pg||
nt|chick: W trying to decide whether to push them, double, or go quietly :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a small @S  migth beat it|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Coldea was really strong in the Qualifying, after 4 rounds they had max possible 25 25 25 18 (bye)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 24  Chagas 5@C North  [where our table 3N down 1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Great Shuffler is on Fishcher's side this hand|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: bob and the Swedes are on fire|pg||
nt|bobholl: so easy if you see 52 crds play @S T|pg||
nt|toral5: cos 100 in 4 rds is NOT many teams get at that level|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure lewis will claim 1 down soon|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But eventually were outdone by Zimmerman,, they wouldve topped easily, but in round 5, Zimmerman but the brakes on and beat them 25-4 if I recall|pg||

nt|afulton: the issue is: |pg||

nt|bobholl: bravo |pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: he managed not to push them into a makeable slam though :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: not sure about the reopening at these colours with that porous suit and defensive cards and shape....but Thomas some time ago traded his pass cards for some magic beans|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @C to J  @CA, @C  |pg||
nt|spooky: maybe Al, but she can afford to lose 1@C to East I think...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|afulton: If she gets the @c's wrong, and Michel wins... @s will come right back|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: can lose @C only because @D33|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anyways back to this boring deal here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: i think @CJ at trick 3 then 3N is cold regardless of East @D length|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toral5: and NOT claiming is making it even more boring|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: not so difficult to play W with 5440 now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|at least 4|nt|marlowepi: not surprisingly, considering the shaope and texture of that E hand, the balance converted a nice plus into a minus...and it gave the opponents a chance to turn a minus in 1NT to a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plus in 2S as well|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|danilo1: do not believe in Slam try ... simply once @S and 3NT by East|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@C is @D's INV+ i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D looks like either "multi" [1-suit @H/@S] or Transfer|pg||
