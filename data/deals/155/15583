mb|2N|mb|p|nt|glen: 2@S in 3rd seat by Nunes is not your typical Fantunes 10-13, its anything up to 12|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|glen: in the CR, NS bid to the three level on a 5-2, here their teammates are in a 4-2 three level contract|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 2nt was Lebensohl.  However, once you make the choice to double, I think you have to go with your original idea which is to bid diamonds over clubs.|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT was Lebenshol here, asking doubler to bid 3@C unless much extras, but I like 2NT as "better minor" Lebenshol|pg||
nt|kareno: That's fine until you are dealt long clubs and a terrible hand :)|pg||

nt|Zmud99: operator will not shut down this room|pg||
nt|kareno: No what, Herve?|pg||
nt|Zmud99: because you will mess up broadcast|pg||

nt|Walddk3: I am trying to make the operator shut down but no luck|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: what happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I wrote a novel|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You must shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: because the score is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Please|pg||
pc|h7|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Somehow I feel I am wasting my time|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|rado: N-S use sophisticated prec @C , EW tooo in my memory from last days|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: or the Dutch equivalent|pg||
nt|pelu: the @S-finess looks ok - dont know @Ds 4-1 so he can lose to @SK|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|pelu: as expected!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes I think this is best. ruffing second one with 10 anyway, so you'll be fine|pg||

nt|glen: the Strul team|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|glen: *his partner's|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: 3@C is a slight underbid by NS methods (they don't require much for an invite here) but S bids 3NT anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the score is incorrect as the last 2 boards in the previous set were not recorded|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: me either :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: unlucky lead |pg||

nt|rado: declarer should take @H finesse to make|pg||

nt|joest: Helgemo thinking about a game try.  That might be debateable white with a superstrong NT behind you|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|glen: 1@H is usually 13/14+, but can be 10/11-13 with both majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: same missed game at other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lml: Once you start 1NT it is probably impossible to get to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if partner super accepts transfer you may as well bid game though|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: but a superaccept really shows 4 not 5|pg||

mb|r|nt|spooky: 1@C=12-14 balanced or 15+ @C's or 18+ any|pg||
nt|spooky: 1@D=0-6|pg||
nt|rado: hard bid for S now|pg||
nt|rado: 2@h, 1NT or Drury|pg||
nt|joest: how many commentators favor double over 1@h here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would double, but 1@h is not so bad either|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|joest: easier to bring spades into focus.  A tad under strength if you're forced to bid hearts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: yes but vul game swings me to aggresion|pg||
mb|2N|nt|spooky: 1@H is 3+@H I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most remarkable board in the previous set was 6@D making when one opponent had @DAx the other one stiff king|pg||
nt|joest: bidding hearts then doubling tends to show only three spdes|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest: this would appear to the appearance of a rare animal these days|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the otherhand, 9743 looks likd a 3 card suit|pg||
nt|joest: the 'natural 2NT" in competition!|pg||
nt|larrymori: no kidding|pg||
mb|3H|nt|spooky: Drijver might double now :)|pg||
nt|rado: other room may present different bidding and contract|pg||
nt|joest: good point henry|pg||

mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: he's had enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: how does this play|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: i see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@H 2@C 1@D|pg||
nt|spooky: for NS or EW?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|joest: this doesn't look like it will fetch|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he can divine to sneak the 9@s through...|pg||
nt|joest: they are in the same contract next door though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: snap|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack is too fast|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|spooky: he doesn't have an entry to finesse @HK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 7 tricks for NS |pg||
nt|oosmanb: same thing|pg||
nt|pelu: 7½ for NS|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this defence couldve cost though if declarer had A@s |pg||
nt|oosmanb: now he has extra @D trick set up?|pg||
nt|spooky: defence has 4@S 2@D and 1@C already... |pg||
nt|oosmanb: although im playing DD, will paulissen play K@C and @c to 10 and then @H finesse??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or give an open @H trick?|pg||
nt|pelu: but I expect that NS are dorced to give an entry to dummy in @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this can get ugly|pg||
nt|pelu: first NS has to find the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: what to play now in N? @SK? only DD u can play @S5|pg||
nt|spooky: let's say north plays @SK, with this @S's in dummy declarer is almost forced to take the ace|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|spooky: @SQ, 2nd/4th through declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: done.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute defence by Brogeland in the open room (did not matter though)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spade to the jack and queen and a *low* club|pg||
nt|joest: that would beat it if south had had the queenof diamonds with his other goodies|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes, the question with 46 would he just bid 1@s?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: so this one is heading down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|spooky: looks like it's made now|pg||
nt|pelu: close to make now - Play @CK!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Squeezes dummy if he plays @D first! (but still makes)|pg||
nt|pelu: max down 1 if East play @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant take @D7 - will in a strange way squeeeze dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: this board totally shows that defending is way harder than declarer play, 1Nx= by North on the other table..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen down, more questions by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: for those just joining us the posted daily totals are incorrect.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: we believe the real state of the match is 123 (OR) to 97 (Meltzer)|pg||
nt|pelu: I have tryed to follow the play in OR - but that dont make sense - sh be down 1 with that play - but prob a mistake by operator in play|pg||
nt|spooky: if Paulissen plays @CK now it will be 8 Imps to Meltzer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he will.. doesnt lose much|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes if its ducked he'll gulp and play another one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|larrymori: with all that?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: hmmm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has to throw @S now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and can actually make an overtrick!!! @h now coming in|pg||
nt|joest: over a redouble, he might have to since jumps are weak|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|spooky: did south throw a trick now? (the @H?)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: same contract likely here|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|Walddk2: Helgemo transferring to his diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: note that the sandwich 1NT was strong|pg||
nt|joest: many paiirs used to play it takeout|pg||
nt|joest: these days, with people opening and responding on nothing you can't afford to play that way (IMHO)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|nt|oosmanb: K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: Brink like to bid 2@Hs again :)|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess they are set for game now..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: still 2@s 1@D 1@C minimum?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I dunno just saying|pg||
nt|lml: do you agree with Willard's pass of 1@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@H myself|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: They open on 9 and respond on 4|pg||
nt|joest: right!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: even against a 7 carder it has no chance, so against a 6 carder...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here they bid game either way it seems|pg||
nt|lml: now if Willard had bid 2@H it would have been a touch harder|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be a push at 110|pg||
pc|h3|nt|spooky: Is the @SA never onside at you oos?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|pelu: ok @SK = the 8. trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: interesting play by helgemo|pg||
pc|c6|nt|spooky: good double from Paulissen |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H least likely to push opponents (in my view)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|oosmanb: aggresive but will give much needed imps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||
nt|spooky: will give Meltzer 9 Imps|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: I like 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: well she is about to find out if she is happy to be in the game or not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: so really this is moving along now.  They are a fair bit ahead of the most of the field|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell down 30 and probably out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Break time:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond leading lavazza by 23|pg||
nt|lml: too bad in a way I like watching them.  But then again that keeps fred geoff and the rest in it|pg||
nt|lml: and they are terrific to watch|pg||
nt|lml: I think Nickell lost quite a bit when two team members died, Soloway and Freeman|pg||
nt|lml: Soloway and Hamman had a very good partnership and I dont think Hamman and Zia have quite found their groove|pg||
nt|lml: and Freeman was such a terrific player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very true|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the Diamond team is a fairly new construct and a force to be reckoned with|pg||
nt|lml: for a long time no doubt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Wolfson 25 up on Flesiher, the other two matches are no contests any more. Diamond and Nickell ahead by 1 zillion against Vito and Robinson respectively|pg||

mb|2S|nt|anton72: boring pass :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: hmmm|pg||
nt|pelu: almost only a 4 card  @C-suit :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: needs @d lead to beat?|pg||
nt|spooky: Drijver needs to find the @D lead|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s may well be strength ambiguous if it promises 5 (and if 2NT denies four)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: wow Jan probabaly ecstatic at that lead|pg||
nt|lml: once South bid 4@S showing at the very least good spades North was getting to slam... seven may be tricky|pg||
nt|lml: so do you want to be in a grand missing Qxxx of trump?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a 7 you really want to bid, when 6 easy to miss|pg||
nt|lml: I can say this and you can't ... especially in the women's game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in bridge world are grands common after opponents open|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: but far from over|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant not easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can throw dummy in the bin, but declarer has enough tricks in his hand unless he gets a diamond lead (unlikely)|pg||
nt|joest: feels like Helgemo is ready for hearts.  I think Weinstein will stay off a heart|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: Gier will think this one over for a while -- as would anybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead, yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: very|pg||
nt|joest: if he hops ace, he will still need to be thinking about which round suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni led a heart|pg||
nt|joest: and of course Weinstein might be trying to talk him out of the spde finesse at trick one|pg||
nt|joest: so there is a lot to think about|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: needs to play on @H not @C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|oosmanb: and he will probably go wrong|pg||

nt|oosmanb: so he'll use @d as entry himself|pg||
nt|pelu: only @H back will now give 3NT|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he takes it and pitches a @h then @cs are safer|pg||

nt|spooky: Thanks Warren :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: How come you know the system so well, Jack?|pg||
nt|joest: he could bid 3@h to show 3-1 in the majors but with the stiff king that is a suspect move|pg||
nt|larrymori: the kingleton is usually better treated as a flat hand|pg||
nt|joest: b/c I play it with both of them and write their notes for them :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see, thanks|pg||
mb|3D|an|alert|nt|oosmanb: I'm surprised that this 4@S actually made at one table|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 4@D is the max at this board, but they might sac again against the game|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H is @S's|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H=transfer to @S's here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was played by W as here, the lead was @s to the king and a @s came back..........|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
mb|4S|an|alert|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||
nt|joest: my bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: So 35 unanswered imps with one possible plus to come in for Joel|pg||
nt|larrymori: is this both minors F|pg||
nt|joest: we just changed that|pg||
nt|larrymori: lol|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d = both minors gf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a state-of-the-match 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't fetch|pg||
nt|joest: but I think 3@h is still 3-1 in the majors, so you be the judge. I had though 3@d was 5-5 but what do I know?|pg||
nt|larrymori: i think it is ambitious|pg||
nt|joest: I have no idea what 4@s is.  That one is a mystery.|pg||
nt|larrymori: rkc?|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h would be that I think|pg||

nt|oosmanb: and they make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: not to mention that Weinstein has nothing resembling a blackwood call :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: I don't see a way of letting this through now..|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|oosmanb: could brink shift to a @C after he gets @S ?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he bid diamonds twice right|pg||
nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: plus the @D bids ..|pg||
nt|spooky: the only chance for West is the @SK onside, if South ducks it once, he might end going -2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West was declarer in the other room because EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|nt|lml: they may push them to the club slam|pg||
nt|joest: Garner way more likely to lead his club and look for his ruff rather than a spade and give partner a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: which will make I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone for joining us, thanks fellow commentators and kibitzers!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D-2 only, which is par i suppose|pg||

nt|fabsayc: mind you is impossible to tell what EW make looking at NS cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Great work!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And ofcourse Roland and the BBO team!|pg||
nt|lml: they might have bought it in 5@D though ... who knows|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT almost certainly an artifial game try of some sort|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: almost no one plays it natural and NF any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for min/max and suit length|pg||
nt|larrymori: to see what kind of a raise 2@h is, 3 or 4,|pg||
nt|joest: often a way to find out if partner has raised on three (among other things|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H max with 4|pg||
nt|larrymori: with no short|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: again a round with very few unexpected results - one of them that the German team Josef and.. lost last segment 14-40 and the3 match with 4 IMP to Vito|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and with that the only Women pair left in the competition got knocked out|pg||
nt|spooky: Maybe the loss of Berg to Consus red Poland is a little surprising|pg||

nt|lml: north-south|pg||
