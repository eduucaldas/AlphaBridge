nt|layzi: strange bord. first he start at 9 triks but play him selvf down to 7 and ending on 8:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  North's @c duck was not totally wrong, only if West has a singleton is it wrong, and even then it might not matter sometimes since the @cK would be able to pitch a loser, but I can't see that ever needing to pitch a loser there|pg||

nt|psridhar: 4S is a good contract but Burrows has to handle the 4-1 trump break delicately|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has an interesting hand, but West's 1@h (on a 4 card suit) may turn off the slam switch|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof but now the @s9 sets up|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  South can go for 4 ruffs in dummy if West has just 1 diamond (so cannot bleed the last diamond)|pg||

nt|layzi: think that will cost some imps|pg||
nt|djneill:  we can guess E-W will get to 4@h in the other room, and it has problems too - ruffing @s with those @h sets up a trump for N-S|pg||
nt|djneill:  N-S did not get to slam on the earlier 5@d either in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|layzi: shold be possible to find! but they will not bid alone...|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|djneill:  West has 4-4 majors but vulnerable, with no singleton, dangerous|pg||
nt|djneill:  to overcall |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|psridhar: tough rebid for N here|pg||
nt|layzi: last result: http://www.rondanecupen.no/resultat/2010lag.htm|pg||
nt|layzi: that wold cost|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has 7 tricks in the form of 3@h, 2@d, 2@c, while E-W can only get 4@s, 2@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  but South may play for 75% - hook @c then later hope @s is onside|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|psridhar: big club wd fare better i guess-1c-1d-2d-2s-4s|pg||
nt|layzi: 3NT the best contract on W hand:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|layzi: not god news for the leders, they will go on a big lose here!|pg||
nt|djneill:  I can't see the @d play being anything but clear though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: looks like 3d showed spd supp as well, wd|pg||
nt|layzi: shold be easy to bid slam here...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|layzi: not al|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|djneill:  now comes the @s (South cashed the @cA to reveal that) - West's @d6 may have been discouraging for @h|pg||
pc|s7|nt|layzi: dont understand the rush..|pg||
nt|djneill:  well done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|layzi: some more imp to Gutta på tur "the guys on tour"|pg||

nt|layzi: last bord before the break, start over at 1430:) |pg||
nt|layzi: now the last bord of this match...|pg||
nt|djneill:  nice defense for E-W|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  in other room earlier, the 3NT was also attempted over the natural 2@s opening (West with 4522 chose 2NT rather than 3@h)|pg||
mb|2S!|an|8-11 p|nt|layzi: last game in this match.. looks like a win for Gutta på tur....|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|layzi: Sandum ask Ruud why the rush?|pg||
nt|djneill:  normal-looking @s lead gave nothing away and later North ducked the @dK when West hooked the @dQ, killing the dummy|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|layzi: 3NT also the best contract here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok so N-S here play multi for the bad weak two's and 2@h/@s for the good weak twos|pg||
mb|3N|nt|layzi: sandum is not happy now|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has the @hK which looks like a sure trick given East's takeout double|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  but on normal defense this is down - 2@d, 1@h, 1@s (can pitch @h on @c)|pg||
nt|djneill:  East on lead, the @dA looks normal, is he thinking of doubling?|pg||
nt|djneill:  surely partner is broke, unless South is psyching|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|djneill:  East does not like having the AK in a 4 card suit, much better 3 card suit (less likely to be ruffed)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|djneill:  ok East will take no chances, cash cash cash, receipt|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|layzi: but 5@d makes also! even opportunity for 12 triks here...|pg||
nt|layzi: have to fix the @d here to make|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|patricck: i guess Otago might try a thin 3NT here, hat could make on a @C guess, but in reality this is probably flat|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|djneill:  same in other room|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|djneill:  chance now for down 2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: no % in advancing over a weak 1nt there|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|psridhar: no 5 card suit, no intermediaries|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the @c was not risky, the takeout double unlikely to be 5-2 clubs|pg||
