mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: against 4@h by South, West can lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wang is studying the opponents convention crd|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, in 4@h you might get an endplay|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps Wang was considering removing to 4@h, knowing that he probably won't be able to use the long hearts in 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c doubtless asked about majors, so South ought to have five hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: East will have a problem on the 4th @c but the bidding will be the clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: explanations are primarily by hand gestures and looking at convention cards|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugraphztb: Katz writing to explain the 2NT alert|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: either someone is legitimately squeezed or they throw the wrong thing anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell explaining the 4 @D alert|pg||
nt|athene: N-S obviously play a double of stayman simply says "i would have doubled 1nt"|pg||
nt|caitlin: probably puppet?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: a reasonable way to play, especially when people bid stayman on nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: west can see that if he passes 1nt, north is sure to double, and now NS are far better-placed |pg||
nt|athene: if you start with stayman, sometimes your opponents have trouble working out they have the whole deck themselves|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks the meaning of his bid, to confirm that it is a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: last hand it was west who had @CKQJ bare|pg||
nt|athene: it helps in the play of 3nt if you know that will be the case every hand :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not this one though  :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nhas yet to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|athene: sementa is wondering if he ought to pass his - he will wonder for a while and then bid 3nt, i would imagine|pg||
nt|caitlin: N has yet to|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting what south can have for this bid, given that he didn't pass the double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think clubs can be his best suit - he would surely pass the double then|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 21 I would GO|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrt2000: surely N should at least correct to 3@H?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: sementa decides that 2nt showed his hand and hence he has to pass|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: but with a weakish hand and 5+ clubs surely south was passing the double of 2@C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrt2000: correct|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|reisig: and with weak  4-4?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: when a person bids stayman with a very weak hand he usually has short (shortish) clubs as he is going to pass any rebid by opener, so south would know his clubs were over east's|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: with weak 4-4 you just bid 2@H then pass 2nt, surely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe not|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asking for a review of the bidding before he leads|pg||
nt|athene: of course this is trivial with 2-2 trumps but declarer will be thinking about worse breaks|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v true|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you cashed two hearts and the queen didn't fall, you would be badly placed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: as you are going to lose the lead in clubs or diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: and the defender with the @HQ might cash it and leave you very short of tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so you might duck a diamond first perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: the club switch was good for the defence - now declarer can't take advantage of 3-3 diamonds to get a club away from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: which might be a very useful play if it turned out someone had an annoying @HQxx|pg||
nt|reisig: Any bets on the result?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can possibly go down with @HQx with west|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 4|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bet -50|pg||
nt|caitlin: making|pg||
nt|athene: you think the defence have been deceptive in clubs?|pg||
nt|reisig: Yup|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer will place west with three clubs|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible the small club switch from @CQx might muddy the waters|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|athene: ok, this looks slightly worrying|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|caitlin: yessssssss|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|reisig: Have I EVER been wrong?|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: in the other room they didn't get the early club shift so i assume declarer indeed got his club pitch on the diamond|pg||

nt|jtr: Vulnerable maybe?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: Quite a lot of work to do here from declarer's perspective|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: the Chinese defenders at the other table on the previous board led spades and shifted to clubs; declarer got the hearts wrong; 11 IMPs to China Open|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: 3nt easier than 4@S here - often the way with a 4333 facing a 5-card major|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Could well be jitters, playing on vugraph and knowing how formidable the opposing team is|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Katz says that the auction 1C p 1D p 1 NT he might have 4 of a major|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|athene: nine easy tricks once he knocks out the spade - will he get something going against west in the minor suits to make more?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 10 I will change it later|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|peachy: declarer has nice spot cards in all non-club suits, so again no imminent danger in any suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|peachy: Thank you operator. THat is a common style in the US, where 2/1 is rather prominent as system. Opener could even have both 4-card majors for 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Even when not playing 2/1, some play that opening 1C and next bidding a major guarantees 4+ clubs.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s might fail...if that's the contract|pg||
nt|athene: well, now he *could* make an overtrick by ducking a club then cashing the @CA and playing @SA, spade to endplay east|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why he should do any of those things|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests that it would have been better to start the spades leading the ten from hand - but that won't look so clever if west has the singleton king|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: just nine tricks will do nicely|pg||
nt|athene: in fact when you play 3nt with a 5-3 major fit you WANT to make nine tricks rather than ten|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C ghestem|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: the advantages of playing ghestem this way (where your 3@C bid never has clubs) are twofold:-|pg||
nt|athene: firstly you can bid it on very strong hands with no fear you will be left there|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: several kibitzers are asking about ghestem vs. michaels|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N was not happy with his pass|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's a Good Thing to identify both your suits explicitly rather than just showing e.g. "hearts and a minor"£|pg||
nt|athene: it means your partner is much better-placed|pg||
nt|athene: whether that is worth giving up a natural 3@C overcall is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: there are many top pairs who feel it isn't|pg||
nt|caitlin: here yes, typically not so|pg||
nt|athene: it's all very well doubling these artificial overcalls to show "cards" or even "a penalty double of one of their suits"|pg||
nt|athene: but you have to discuss follow-ups|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: S thinking|pg||
nt|athene: in particular, is pass forcing, and what does double mean?|pg||
