nt|ahollan1: for multitasker  you can try to follow bidding/play in other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: @D 8 is gud here.so 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa jiggles his leg while Greco thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: With the diamond in the pocket, it's an easy hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be jiggling his leg a lot this match I think :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: trumps now ll restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||

nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all fantunes 1-suit openings are 1-round-force|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: can be weaker if (5/4) @H & @S  but usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|jtr: Surprised Garner didnt express and opinion about 4@s|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
nt|jtr: an opinion|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Fantoni did express one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni expressed a strong opinion now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Well, the opening was stronger here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: But even so|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||

nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|pbmarstr: 3 NT will have better chances than 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes answered UNDICI FULVIO|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i'm told one south opened 1@C and actually bought it in 2@C on the auction 1@C - 1@H; 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: seems a little bit wet perhaps not to overcall 1@S with the west hand|pg||

pc|s5|nt|toral5: here comes my style 1nt:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni will think for a while about this|pg||
nt|jtr: I used to bet against Fantoni making contracts until i ran out of money|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: It is impossible not to take the spade Q I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and hope in his eyes...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||

nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|jtr: Ducking wasnt a feasible play though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been very interesting [double dummy] to duck trick 1   maybe then Brogeland gets endplayed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Easy 3nt without a diamond lead and since they are blocked, even with an unlikely diamond out |pg||
nt|athene: E-W might be Flannery-ites, judging from 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have a card for them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: @D lead as the cards lie was killing|pg||
nt|kareno: Ellen :)|pg||

nt|jtr: East may just go passive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: Neither minor looks attractive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think Brogeland should have played @S 6 to indicate no interest for @H. Count is not interesting here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the name field on BBO alowes 10 limit so i asked him to choose his name|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and this is his choice|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikesl: This auction has had the unfortunate effect of getting North on play, perhaps with the queen of diamonds lead.  If South were to play the hand, West would have a difficult choice ...|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: east 4@H bid from west, facing a sound raise, with good opening bid and six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: easy 4@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is a standard queen, but it varies at times|pg||

nt|jtr: Nobody has a sad enough life to calculate it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes would be high on that list -- maybe even higher than their WBF ranking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking nunes about nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking...he learned from fantoni|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not the fastest player|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: i had him 2 or 3 times on vg this week and did not seem slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in politically correct speak    they are     deliberate|pg||

nt|caitlin: stats show not bidding stayan with 4-3-3-3 is far superior|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: he has to loose a club and a spade... so no imps at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he can even loose some|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: then declarer has to drop the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing against sound opening bidders you could do it|pg||
nt|athene: since north would be pretty much marked with the @SQ after south produced the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but Meckwell open pretty light|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nt is 14 to 16 points by Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: still he has the same decision here, anyway, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: you can't try to endplay north as you can't strip his clubs|pg||
nt|sommer: N MUST have @DK + @SQ|pg||

nt|jtr: North would always play the 5 with 1053|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if south turned up with the @DK (which he surely couldn't) then the @SQ would just have to be dropping in north's hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|athene: well, EW missed the game in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: (4@H, previous board)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the bids are not entered until the board is passed through the screen so that the clicks are not heard :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Daniel Gulyas and Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||

nt|athene: 1@d hearts i'm told, and 1nt strong (18-19)|pg||

nt|athene: i guess EW play the style where they just complete the transfer with any weak notrump|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT looks like a 18-19NT or something|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks while Boyd writes an explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Nunes playing may be faster|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|athene: 2@H another transfer, so the strong hand gets to play it in spades|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure if 1nt denied four hearts - probably, i would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson rubs his head before going back into a reflective pose while considering his bid.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sommer: ..ya, but why prefer 3NT to 4@S from E?|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks a ? and Boyd quietly explains|pg||
nt|sommer: @Dlead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asking questions and Robinson talks quietly|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@Hlead from @S and @Dshift is good, but hard|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks if the 2 @S bid shows 5 @S and Boyd says yes|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Sementa still seems angry|pg||
nt|gulyas: also, if you are non-vul, you are not pushing games as hard - vul games are worth a lot!|pg||
nt|sommer: game was not %-well, tho|pg||
nt|sommer: but good to bid, when it makes;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: discussing the hand all 4 of them now|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmm 3NT looks beatable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C artificial game force|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin played sementa for aj @S.so tried a @S ruff effect.but tht dint sound gud cos sementa cd easily have 6@S|pg||
nt|sommer: I think, E would have a "little" 3@H:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, both the last game (4@S bd7) and this (bd 8) were so-so games, but since the first one was in vul, they went for it|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Even on a @s lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: its simple - say the other table misses the game: if non-vul, you are +6 if you make, -6(-5) if you don'T|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd rubs his chin while he thinks|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you are vul, you lose 6 if it didn't make, but gain 10-11 if it does|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: So far the Zimmermann team has played a perfect session and there has been nearly no possibilities to gain IMPs for Strul.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: 3nt is a winner here.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sommer: no endplay ... no make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way to make this - you can ruff the @HK down but you don't have the entry to cash the @HQ|pg||
nt|sommer: Boyd was tempted by his 4-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 @D usually promises 2 @D|pg||
nt|bessi2: only way to let this through is if meck ducks the Q of clubs but I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|athene: E-W in the other room given a much easier ride; east could show extras and stop in 3@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: with both @CA and @HK wrongly placed for declarer, he is likely to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a review of the bidding|pg||
nt|gulyas: good lead there|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: had had placed the 4 @C bid near the table, withdrew it, and then placed it there again :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is a rather nasty play problem though.. he might even finesse the hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, but still 1 down|pg||
nt|bessi2: either that or cross to the ace of hearts to play a club.. playing Rodewell for axx in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks for a further explanation of the 1 @S bid made by Rodwell, which denied 5 spades|pg||
nt|sommer: he may go for @CAxx in N too|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but still -1 at least|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think he will finesse hearts trick 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: -1 most likely, either losing the 4th @C or the @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd makes no move to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: keeps shifting in his chair :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks another question of the bidding|pg||
pc|d8|nt|toral5: last brd proved to be very costly.|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to run into a trump promotion with 2-2 trumps but he certainly can't afford to cash a second top trump if they are 3-1 and then be denied a club ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with @Hfinesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now:)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jtr: N/S at the other table have had a fairly horrid time|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: the 1@H bid might itself be light but you would not expect south to bid 2@S on a known 3-card suit with no values|pg||
nt|athene: so you know he has something|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just hoped it was the @HK, reasonably enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: orry folks, techinical difficulties|pg||
nt|gulyas: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc back|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: are we down yet?:)|pg||

nt|toral5: fit leader 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is probably down, but 4@S could be close|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just have to get their club set up here before it vanishes on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: south had better not lead his singleton!|pg||
mb|1H|an|alerted|nt|toral5: 4@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Or more - north of course will raise spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4@c would suggest clubs (if that's east's second suit) or else hearts.|pg||

nt|bessi2: rodwell decides to bid 3@s and dbl 4h later i suppose... better then dbling twice I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=F1, 14+ or good 12/13 5+@C or 15+ BAL or 4@C441|pg||

pc|d3|nt|toral5: i bet @C ace is going away|pg||
nt|kareno: Whoops - there goes a club trick.  But there aren't eleven tricks (or even close if defense leads trumps).|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be down one from this point, though.|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie,trump lead and @C ace was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco puts his cards down and holds his head between his hands|pg||
nt|toral5: and than @D.tht wd ve been 800 i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is fidgeting and his leg jiggles|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr this lead greco will escape for a smal loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco makes no move to play a card|pg||
nt|kareno: Greco a slooooooow player|pg||
nt|toral5: can greco manage 3 @D ruffs?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Dismond has picked up 27 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: "Sorry" from Greco|pg||
nt|sommer: good 4@S and sac|pg||
nt|athene: north with five spades and the void in hearts doesn't want to double and double, because that will lead to partner passing too often|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@s might have been a close affair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks Robinsons if his bid shows a minimum and Robinson concurs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-18 HCP, not 4@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sommer: well, is down with best defence|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson wiggles his fingers over the dummy|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|toral5: ?????|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for holding up the play|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might have eleven tricks? five spades, four clubs in south hand, two ruffs in north hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: of course, no-one is going to play in a mere 5-4 club fit with a splendid 5-3 spade fit available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: Boyd will see a small hope, when @DJ falls, but he will be disappointed|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly hard to find:)|pg||
nt|jtr: But they can get the @cs going|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzta: Boyd is emotionless upon receiving the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4-0 hearts isn't so bad - it means 4@S might be making|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he is not doubled:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd leans his chen on his left hand and thinks further|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: or rather his chin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland led right suit -- just [in this case]  wrong card|pg||
nt|jtr: And declarer may not read the @d situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 was ostensibly 4th best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in his hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and......back on the table|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: i should go get a coffee|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|toral5: but did he play @C q?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: Now two rounds of hearts after club ace inflicts some damage.  But must play a diamond after that.|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 800 now|pg||
nt|toral5: same position wt v discussed on an initial trump lead by duboin|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes, Greco played a small spade and trumped it and then lead the @C queen!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|kareno: So instead of down one, it'll be two .|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzta: More thinking for Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 now - cant take all trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think the way to beat 4@s is repeated heart plays be the defence.. pls correct me if I am mistaken|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Does not help to hold back the @D Q if Boye has 4 diamonds then|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Okay down two.  He can claim now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards are shown|pg||
pc|h4|nt|toral5: no.3 down|pg||

pc|s4|nt|gulyas: repeated trump plays work, too|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: Oh dear|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Might have the @D king of course|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see why he did that|pg||

nt|jtr: And neither will he be able to soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye asked YOU CAN NOT HAVE 4 spades isnt it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's just great, try it|pg||
nt|athene: but would east really lead a small heart here from the jack? that would often be giving a trick, so he would only do it if he could see the defence needed to cash out fast|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
mc|6|nt|athene: but perhaps he was trying a double bluff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't if he doesn't have it :)|pg||
nt|athene: since "everyone" wins the ace first in that AK/J guessing situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He pretended that he did not|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: weinstein is taking a break|pg||
nt|mikesl: Winning the ace of hearts instead of the king has some merit but it is possible that this would confuse West in some situations.  |pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's always the problem with falsecards|pg||
nt|mikesl: Winning the ace would be most effective if it came at trick one and East intended to return his low heart.  |pg||
nt|athene: like when you brilliantly underlead ace at trick 1, find KJx in dummy, and then partner finesses studiously against dummy with Q9x anyway|pg||
nt|mikesl: South should be suspicious of that defense. Imagine a defender (east) with AJ9 of the suit.  He might fear that continuing the suit would be costly.  Declarer can use this thought ...|pg||
nt|mikesl: himself.|pg||
nt|mikesl: Helgemo has led fourth best a few times and also fifth best.  Makes things intriguing.|pg||

nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|athene: trying an intra-finesse in spades, playing east for @S10x/@S9x|pg||
nt|athene: now a club through, trying to get west off some endplay|pg||
nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will lead the @SJ from dummy next time he plays the suit, holding his losers to two|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|sommer: is it over?|pg||
nt|bessi2: he can now.. play a heart to the jack ruff diamond and exit in spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no cards were played while we were offline :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahhh:)|pg||
nt|athene: if he views to drop the @H10 offside he can even unblock his @H8 and finesse the six :) as a kibitzer points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still has not played a card :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can you remake the score, Ala?|pg||
nt|bessi2: the 10 of hearts doesnt need to drop.. west will be endplayed in spades.. he knows he has the king|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure his nice intra-finesse play actually got him anything because if he gets forced in diamonds it doesn't matter whether he ruffs with a small spade or a boss spade|pg||

nt|mikesl: Wonder what 1NT's limits are?|pg||
nt|athene: Some play that 1nt is anything up to a GF, but still not forcing - you can get some awkward situations with 14 facing 11|pg||
nt|athene: some play that opener only passes 1nt with a minimum balanced, so 11-12 or so|pg||
nt|mikesl: West has a max pass then.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nickell only +40, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: with 13-14 he has to invent a bit|pg||
nt|athene: invent a bid sorry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|mikesl: N-S have only three losers in hearts.  Wonder how many winners they would have had.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good decision by E-W to stay low on this layout|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: discussion about whether helgemo should have opened 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ drops the jack, and @C7 hits the table...NS can get their own back on helness for his small heart lead against 1nt a moment ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure even 1 can make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably not|pg||
nt|mikesl: It is easy to think that North could have bid 2H.  Note, however, that East has Kxxxx in both minors.  He might have had Kxxxx of hearts instead.  Hindsight.|pg||
nt|athene: well, if east has @HKxxxx, that gives south about a billion minor-suit cards|pg||
nt|mikesl: North is thinking that if he wins the queen, South may not read the suit if North then puts South in.  I suspect North is considering playing the ten.|pg||
nt|athene: but of course being vulnerable playing imps does tend to slow people down a bit|pg||
nt|athene: when it's a potential misfit|pg||
nt|mikesl: Misfit is the excuse for not bidding.  Sometimes it is a good excuse.  But, they seem not to have a spade fit which hints that your side may have a fit in hearts.  Very high stake ...|pg||
nt|mikesl: guesswork.|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder how close helgemo was to opening 1nt - maybe if just one of those nines had been tens...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if Garner inserts the 10, Helness will still have to find a 7th trick when diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now that he did the right thing, a club switch will defeat it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how @CQ can be better than the seven there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that Weinstein can read this|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mikesl: Only if South does not continue clubs.  He does not know East has J of hearts only.  East might have J10x(x)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: @CQ was kind of dangerous|pg||

nt|toral5: he,benito and forquet..:)true legends of the game|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c can be made with the Morton's Fork coup.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's very, very unlikely to be bid, however.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh dear, this might go down now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too eager to meet|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead next door gave a trick effectively|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzta: maybe not so unlikely lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Morton's Fork would be leading low to dummy's heart in this case.  If east ducks, heart goes away.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Oh, can't be made because east can ruff second diamond - sorry, I tricked myself.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: I love Morton's Fork coup so much I named my trading company after it years ago.|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: is there a technical term for sticking a Morton's Fork into partner on opening lead?|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyway, let's watch Duboin try to make six clubs.  Heart loser going away now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can East be squeezed in the majors? Barnet Shenkin suggests that he can|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|caitlin: but will Greco get the ruff?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: If only east had a doubleton diamond, Morton would work :)|pg||
nt|toral5: east will be under severe presure to guard Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin shakes his head no and then sits back in his chair|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Is there not a squeeze if declarer rises @HK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|toral5: CANT afford to cash @S.else no entry in hand for setting a M suit squeeze on east|pg||
nt|jkotor: but E can play @s after A@h|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not good enough|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Declarer has communication hearts then|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco says you have to leave the cards out|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand.  South preparing squeeze but spade return will break that up I think.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|toral5: @S will kill communication now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jkotor: still gib wins it somehow, but after @c now, finesse @d and?|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a single game swing the whole set  Not that there have been many game contracts|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: Now it will but not after @HK at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: club to hand, @D finesse, @DA and the trumps -- 2 tricks ago|pg||

nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
mb|p|an|alerted|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
mb|4H|an|alerted|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jtr: I cannot myself comment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jtr: An Irish slam for those that ask, is where the opponents take their 2 trump tricks and then wait for their Ace(s)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: No the slam has excellent chances. All you have to do is lead Q of @D from hand and S to take the Ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphztb: thanks all... see you in an hour|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S will be some cunning heart raise|pg||
nt|mikesl: What is 2S?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's 3 or 4 hearts and a pretty wide range of points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you bid the East hand now?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: maybe it's weak with 4 hearts or limit raise with 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, simple|pg||
nt|athene: he bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|athene: the devilish cunning of the man!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe Geir can bid less than 5 now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|mikesl: East really wants into this auction.  3H might be Michaels of some sort.  Double can mean a lot of things ranging from lead directing etc.|pg||
nt|athene: is 4 the limit on the @HA lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|d!|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mikesl: Ace of hearts gives declarer enough tricks.  South has to be careful.  His only logical successful lead against 5D is a club.  Unless he leads low from a doubleton trump.,|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: double alerted on one side... garner no idea|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a splinter, singleton or void in hearts and a big diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: 4@S a cue bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: EW have all the side-suit controls in the world - 6@D looks inevitable|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe helgemo should have contented himself with 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One could argue that Helgemo bids 4@C, fit-bid, that would stop Helness|pg||
nt|athene: bit unlucky that EW have quite so many honours wasted facing voids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C instead of 4@H I mean|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|mikesl: There is a scenario that lets 6D make.  If South leads the ace of hearts, ruffed, and East eliminates clubs, East can lead the queen of diamolnds.  South might feel the need to ...|pg||
nt|mikesl: take the ace.  |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mikesl: Looks like it is making for a different reason.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: laughter at the king falling|pg||
nt|athene: helness will see a glimmer of hope here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikesl: actually, there is a spade loser.  East may choose to lead the ten of hearts, hoping that South does not cover.  That would allow for two spade discards from dummy.|pg||
nt|athene: but he must know the @SK is almost certainly offside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: south, who has probably read "why you lose at bridge", isn't doubling just because he has two aces|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|s2|nt|mikesl: He will probably play AK and ruff a club. That goes nowhere so the sneaky ten of hearts will look best.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|s6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|dJ|nt|athene: you could play to pin @HJxx in north's hand perhaps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess you know that north has very few hcp and hence four hearts, not three|pg||
nt|athene: (if my understanding of 2@S is correct)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mikesl: Actually, with North pitching a heart, East can not play for Jxx in the North hand.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mikesl: Now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dQ|nt|athene: ah right he has thrown a heart has he|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|mikesl: Helness is planning on telling his teammates that he was down one in 5Dx.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: better to tell them you were one down in seven :) then they will respect your play and assume your partner is a mad overbidder|pg||
