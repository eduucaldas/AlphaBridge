nt|vugraphzsw: the Chinese are also videotaping the match, and a second camera may be broadcasting toChina in real time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: close match 71 to 74 so look for a battle today. |pg||
nt|toral5: unfortunately south CANT get on lead|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek wil make this|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer should play on @D|pg||
nt|toral5: if he elects to play on @H,he ll go down.|pg||
nt|toral5: north just has to insert @H q|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|chick: @S10 good return, signal the @H entry|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: Hi again Sapan|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek will be forced to duck.now defense can play @C ace and back,seting 2@C,2@D and a @H|pg||
nt|toral5: hi osman|pg||
nt|mrt2000: although how N thinks S is going to will a trick is a mystery to me !   lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C a@H a@S and 2 @D is all i hope|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|chick: the @S10 also set up an entry to S hand, but not much use for it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek is in trouble now|pg||
nt|toral5: @S back now|pg||
nt|bobholl: now it may be 2down :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room same contract|pg||
nt|chick: N still has the spade to escape an endplay|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W has gone to sleep|pg||
nt|chick: what if she leads a heart and ducks S's 10?|pg||
nt|bobholl: north will overtake and cash 2 down|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S will cash to @S and exit with a @C|pg||
nt|chick: (not that this is obvious to the declarer)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry stupid|pg||
nt|chick: if N overtakes and cashes out, it's only -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: open it was played by E which is much better|pg||
pc|h8|nt|toral5: he cd stil have made,if he had preserved a @C on table|pg||
nt|toral5: i think he is down for sure|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|bobholl: i guess carla will take no risk and cash 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: is it 100% certain that N knows where the @S7 is?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: think so originally 4th best played back|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the carding at trick 2 told N that|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @S is good now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|chick: you were right Bob, go for the sure thing :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|toral5: @C preserving wd have helped.say he wins 2nd @S on table,cashes @H ak,comes in hand with 3rd @S and plays @D jack and 4th @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: will be a push |pg||

nt|hedyg: rest is all very friendly|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be an exciting deal here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|hedyg: i prefer X as S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: maybe only 8 tricks with spade lead in other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: N/S 4@s of course but at these colours 5@c is a viable save altho layout is a bit dangerous|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: morning  Bob|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Bob :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will bid here |pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: oh perhaps shopuld have tried the clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can revert to hearts if she doesnt have clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: an unlucky lay of trumps this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think it costs nothing to show the clubs when pard has made a negative double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: the camera they were using to record the match makes a beep, so they have been asked to cut it off|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: wish they would turn ours on!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: as it happens also unlucky lay of @C, but I agree Mike @C must be wiser|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: the save should still make a profit|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is quite silent i believe|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|mcphee: is Plan B here Heady?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps spade spade ruff first|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about i try to ruff some stuff with my small @hs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps spade spade ruff|pg||

nt|bobholl: nicely played :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W had to throw a @C not a @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: first blood to holland |pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: From a beautiful day in Philadelphia|pg||
nt|davidstern: Warm and Sunny|pg||
nt|bobholl: muiderberg ? |pg||
nt|bobholl: will S risk an info double on 1 @H |pg||
mb|1S|nt|uni_cicam: we are back in 3rd session in Match Martens-NIckell|pg||
mb|d|nt|uni_cicam: There was probably an appeal in the first round so 9 more imps for Martens team|pg||
nt|bobholl: dekkers knows they have a big @S fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|uni_cicam: 3S is a comentator misclick?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Willie from New  York here again.|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Joe, our operator|pg||
nt|chick: I like the 5 card overcall better|pg||
nt|mrt2000: this could get v messy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Stern|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spades seems like a lot of work for 10 tricks in the OR|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H shows 55 an, 2NT asking|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, thanks|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit over strength 2 @H so 6 won't be reached :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C can get fairly bloody|pg||
nt|mrt2000: u bet !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 3NT by Kopecky will come|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@S now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: brad will surely bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: it is 5@S for the vulnarable NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: He thought about it.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@S on a trump guess and NO @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice treatment forcing 3@C by partner for this hand anyway|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 9 tricks so we can relax in the second board|pg||
nt|chick: N knows S is short in hearts :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: There goes the @s guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was about to ask how about trumps whenever|pg||
nt|toral5: now no guess:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: the defence is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT further explained as try for game, single suited...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: test|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 are easy only looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1st board was +2 IMPs for Nickell|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sure, but Kopecky will not have any problems with making it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Good for him to take some time in the first boards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|uni_cicam: last sessions proved most happend in the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopacky-Kurka are playing ACOL with 5c @S and 12-14 NT, 2 over 1 is 9+|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: 6 @C doubled in other room |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: should still make 3@S, 4@S would need @h to be picked up?|pg||
nt|toral5: he can make 10|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room -500 in 5@H doubled|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|bobholl: 5 @S migth have some difficulties :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|uni_cicam: if @H finesse will be wrong, will be difficult to guess @D, but @H K is on side, no problems for Kopecky|pg||
nt|chick: turns out to be a good save for a small gain|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|oosmanb: For BBO JEC matches fans, Teodorescu is LeRouMain|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrt2000: I think it should have gone for 800 mind you|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 4@S will make but is not completely sure yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep (vriend) will not be sure she can trump the 2nd @H small|pg||
nt|chick: better to trump the clubs and use @Ds as entry|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzsx: cross ruff works well in 5@S, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: South is the one with most @C (almost ) now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|uni_cicam: every player will duck @H K, is there any other line of play?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|uni_cicam: can still loose 3 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: will give ruff :) but nothing essential|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: cant afford to duck @D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess she 'll play Q@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: marion has a difficult decision now |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think she ''l play a @C to J but just guessing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: now Vriend's turn to think|pg||
nt|bobholl: this is almost as good as @C to 9|pg||
nt|bobholl: if fred doesn't ruff he will never beleieve it :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: believe|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange that he doesn't play for @H to be 32|pg||
nt|anton72: just safety play....what is strange|pg||
nt|caitlin: strange|pg||
nt|anton72: your point |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrt2000: play @DA, ruff @H high, draw trump and enjoy the @Ds|pg||
nt|mrt2000: does that work?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but she needs 1 @H trick also|pg||
nt|chick: I think that leaves her 1 trick short|pg||
nt|chick: @DA, @D, @D, crossruff?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so only way is the a@D Q@H |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|bobholl: @H and @D now :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no, the cross-ruff works too|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: It is amazing how often a trump lead seemingly loses a trcik but comes back in the play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: good guess|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|davidstern: West squeezed?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|uni_cicam: if not cashing @c and play all @H, E will be squeezed in black suits|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: if @H are 4-1 off side yhis will not help :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 of @S @H 8 well done|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|toral5: wel deserved 1 imp for sadeks lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Ive been told Ionite is kuky2 on BBO. We love fellow BBO'ers :)|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 3@c ????|pg||
nt|bobholl: the @H is not a very bad lead just unlucky :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|uni_cicam: without prevention, N raised 1@H to 3@H in Open room, EW makes it a bit harder here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I suspect the @H9 from dummy was a mistake|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: spade is more efficient with partner's double|pg||
nt|bobholl: she can't misguess @D lucky for her|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 3@c openeing in other room is curious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: she is running her clubs quickly and I°ve lost the play, now diamond ace and queen|pg||
nt|bobholl: she ''l play all trumps hoping for an unlikely squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: dp|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a small @C our grand old lady should not duck just in case she finesses @D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: don't think it mattered|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as this is now going off|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|mrt2000: always was I guess|pg||
nt|chick: QJ72 certainly looked like pretty good stoppers, but turned out to be just 1, whether or not the 9 was played|pg||

nt|bobholl: but bep won't |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lestergold: 6@c is an enormolus slam|pg||

mb|1D|nt|hedyg: EW play Acol with 5 card @s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h no doubt spades not an encouragement at this stage!|pg||
nt|mcphee: any predictions as to who will win this event?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: you think it looks like a natural bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsw: not natural but not a puppet|pg||
nt|mcphee: I suspect E felt they showed encouragement with the 3@D bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it certainly does not show @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: that is, doesn't force two spades|pg||
nt|mcphee: right|pg||
nt|mcphee: ty Joe|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not easy to reach the slam but i think west shopuld bid 3@h oveer 3@d hand to good|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: lots of writing notes on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|hedyg: shows @s but not forcing to 2@s|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

pc|c7|nt|hedyg: i dont think W ever showed her strength|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think more west's fault she has the slammish hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 2@H bid used a lot of room|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: and hasnt actually shown it|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is true Hedy, but the 3@D bid sounds like a try for 3N|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: she would have bid the same missing 1 of her aces|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|cA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: it does but west must make one bid to show she is interested in higher things her hand is suitable for play in a club game in any case so why not show the extras bidding 3@h|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|hedyg: does anybody know what 3@H over 2@H would have meant?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west's bid of 3@c could have been with a weak hand how can paertner know she has a monster|pg||

nt|hedyg: i hate to disagree with you Bob :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: so do i but i put blame ion west she has heard club support now she has to tell pard that she has a good hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: pard has invited game so it must be safe to do that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: hold it, when did she find out re @c support?|pg||
nt|mcphee: what did it cost to bid 3@H after 3@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not deny @D stop?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: what does pd do after 3@H when he has no @D stop?|pg||
nt|mcphee: it may, but does not preclude playing 3N does it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|mcphee: for example E bids 3@S next|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 4 @cs on xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: bids spades |pg||
nt|mcphee: once E showed some life they were going to game|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: no panic about missing game with west'shand|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think Simons was put off by her pd showing @ss with 2 @H for her singleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcphee: I agree with that Hedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n may even be unmakeable when 51c is cold|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: say she bids 3n and pard does not have diamond ace maybe more values in majors dim lead and has to give up club the dims are run|pg||

nt|hedyg: in the mean time............how good was 5@C here?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|hedyg: sry 6@c i mean|pg||

nt|mrt2000: another slam!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|caitlin: I know Fred and Brad well........very steady, thoughtful players|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|toral5: looks like more imps coming for lavazza|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless things have changed drastically since the 2008 World Championships,  NS play different systems depending on vulnerability|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 11 tricks seems a lot.....|pg||

nt|bobholl: 2@S 2nt 3@C i guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzsx: we will assume 2H is a transfer |pg||
nt|uni_cicam: good 12 possible? :-)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H lead will give 7TH trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: true, but I think 6@C will make|pg||
nt|lml: quite terrible slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Jassem in 4@S west|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: 11 more to lavazza|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: dangerous contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: spade queen lead in other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: stange|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 42 @C 32 is around 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: q@c will be better|pg||
nt|lml: but that line doesn't make it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yvesj49: west must count the hands|pg||
nt|lml: diamonds 5-2 you mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's true but think it's the best line|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 2N is forcing   3@H looks to be artificial saying MORE @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: when ace of @h in south seat|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @C for no  loser and @H for 1 loser makes 6@C|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: 12 tricks in clubs much easier with a @H lead from E|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: not dangerous -- impossible|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably Q@s in north seat....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Nickell-Katz use standard signals|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk5: Operator, please give N-S a Czech Republic flag (they are not from Poland)|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: do not know it they play SMITH signal, will be handy here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well now possisble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stealing 2nd @H is huge|pg||
nt|yvesj49: to have 12 count|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|bobholl: but she doesn't know yet |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: looking at that dummy, it is a bit surprising Nickell didn't attack @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ducking 1st round of @D gives Martens a losing option next time he plays the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't read them, but i'm told the recently released books authored by Martens are excellent|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: after @H now she'll know|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: a@d and @d and it's closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: ace surely and end play N|pg||
nt|bobholl: again "forced"to guess good but she (laura) is under pressure maybe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't think she'll finesse @C|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|uni_cicam: ducking second @H is not very helpfull, knowing partner has even cards in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S also relies on @C finesse|pg||
nt|davpro: declarer might get back an imp more here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|davidstern: I like the 4@H bid as, if the opponents do compete to 4@S you can attend to tht too|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT is down after taking @H A, unfortunately no information for S, just a try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck could have started with 5@H - and his quick play of the suit put Kurka in doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it would need to be specifically @HA and @D or 2nd @C and misguess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: at least an imp for NS which is also counting|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Meck's play gave defense biggest problems|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3/5 leads so no chance to missgues probably|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't think 3/5 leads were allowed in that part of the world  [2nd/4th very common]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: trust me, it is :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   just bad attempt at joke|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: it is around 50/50 in Czech Republic between thee leads|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: with 9 tricks now, finessing would be suicidal|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: now @C shift essential -- but @S8 is entry and trump 22 meant Martens would always prevail|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yvesj49: stange play by west|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: So from a 2 imp lead it has now blown out to 17|pg||
nt|yvesj49: strange*|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|yvesj49: oopsss|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: sorry this is nine tricks ... she could have finessed|pg||

nt|kerasidis: sure hedy|pg||
nt|mcphee: I can appreciate trying for 6, but not insisting|pg||

nt|mcphee: the dble was very sensible knowing suits are not breaking|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2 down it seems!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: the Chinese did bid the good slam earlier|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think that is a little result merchanting doubles like this can attract redoubles and massive disaster|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Joe but again there N had not overcalled|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s are pretty unlimited on the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: I do not believe they redble that often|pg||
nt|lestergold: pure lujck that pard has 2 cold club tricks|pg||

nt|bobholl: if she didnt notice the small @C she doesn't know it's 100%|pg||
nt|chick: finessing the club when opp diamonds are established would be silly|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@S will be too high for N/S|pg||
nt|lml: but she would have already had nine tricks in|pg||
nt|chick: true, after the @H10 set up|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: and she might as well take best shot for most overtricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards are available online for both pairs   EW from the 2010 USBF Trials,  NS from the 2008 World Championships|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: i'll dig out the links if anyone is interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in college we used to play system  Mandatory 3rd seat Opener|pg||
nt|bobholl: red is just points i am told |pg||
nt|davpro: A light opening...NS needs some big swings...in their favour|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: So this could well be another 5 IMPS|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3Nt is working with this distribution, but impossible to get there, or?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: S is passed hand so Kopecky will not force this hand probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play transfers after 1M-dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we went down a lot in college|pg||
nt|davpro: W can see 4 tricks in defense against 3@d :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will brad double 3@S ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: very dangerous|pg||
nt|davpro: will N only bid 3@s?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chick: wow, pretty ambitious slam in the OR|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't seen it yet, you can watch live streaming [video AND sound] of one table every set  at  http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 2NT? showing a club suit with a chance for D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Support DBL but it isn't obligatory to show 3 in this situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks like a fredin redouble :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: can they find out their identical distributions ?|pg||
nt|chick: a 3@D preempt by E make the OR auction much tougher|pg||
mb|4H|nt|uni_cicam: oh, was just writing as I know Kopecky, he will take an action, didnt, 2@S it is|pg||
nt|davpro: 4th highest |pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: this can earn a bit more, we will see how many tricks NS will get|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: maybe flat board.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a small gain for holland again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 1 imp|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: west is young player like Marion ?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I seldom pass 8 card suits myself|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is vulnerable so :)|pg||
nt|chick: in this case it worked, but I hate to preempt my partner with a nice major holding like Qxx and a void in the other|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: defense unlikely to get their @H trick|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: E can discard either H or C so might be only 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and goes 1 off in 3DX|pg||
nt|lml: if it is our style to open hands like this vul 3 level then its fine but otherwise partner will expect a real suit|pg||
nt|lml: your|pg||
nt|chick: so I admit, I would pass E's hand|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh doesn't expect the @D to be ruffed|pg||
nt|chick: ouch (for Arnolds) :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky tried to take 2 club tricks before E will discard them, but not succesful in this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd of 4 14-board segments for the Round of 16    the McConnell [women] are in the Round of 8 [Quarter Final] playing 15 board sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if Rosenblum will begin 15 board sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: me neither, I wa a bit confused today it is "only" 14|pg||
nt|lml: it was set up by the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: well, with no preempt, no reason to expect an 8-1 split|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: Arnolds|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yvesj49: 1 spec told me laura (west i suppose) play bridge since 3 years!|pg||
nt|lml: she should duck|pg||
nt|lml: whatever happens Lu's play of the @HJ is very nice and a lesson to all of us|pg||
nt|mrt2000: game over|pg||
nt|bobholl: if she ducks @S ruff and @H back 1 down |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose Q+J allowed too|pg||
nt|davpro: hte @s-suit will be picked up. So, yes|pg||
nt|lml: she may think a while but I am pretty sure she will play a spade|pg||
nt|chick: and with the known @D distrib, she should worry about that.... W has no choice but to shift to a @S|pg||

nt|davpro: *shortly|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: with this line, he will loose if @S will be 2:2,but since S was passed hand, was better to go for one down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: EW have a solid card in other room...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: diamond lead atother table gave a trick away|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: what's the ooops for ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|davidstern: Three level for NS and maybe one level higher for EW|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT obviously was some kind of @S raise|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 2@C was only 1-round force [not automatic game force]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: interesting hand is coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they play double as 12-15 or strong so they will get (at least) 1 higher|pg||
pc|d6|nt|uni_cicam: Now N has a @C discard to get rid of one @S|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: BUT, few more are still in the hand :-(, let see how Kopecky will handle this|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps coming for lavazza as 5@D got dbled in other room|pg||

nt|yvesj49: Marion is in attack|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is a balanced game raise (which I sometimes play)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzsx: sadek asked about 4C, South replies natural |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: then asked about the 2C bid responded forcing. |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south asking about the 3S, undiscussed, but jump should be long spades.  |pg||

nt|bobholl: they didn't notice :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So Lavazza took a while but starting to put the pedal to the metal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: there was a director call on the 3S bid we may need to adjust the last board. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: or perhaps one of the pitches was actually not a @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @C or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: doubling 4@H in Open room was risky, but might earn few imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess multi so 2@S now|pg||
nt|lml: you might overcall diamonds on the east hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|davidstern: Good hand EW make 4 either major while NS have good save -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: But EW have to judge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@D    5@Cs possible; 11-17|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S always for me|pg||
nt|lml: while you only have 5 they are very chunky|pg||
nt|lml: and it is lead directing on occasion|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope they don't get too high may be if arnolds bids 3@D now they will|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: so much for that guess Al |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: this will win some imp but not enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: So spotlight on Wesy|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: I was wondering what the lead was at the other table...  |pg||

nt|bobholl: i think laura should have bid 2@H but not sure |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sry, i thought you meant opening 2@H.  here would deny 16 points I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since 1@H=4+  Kurka using some form of checkback -- but with 4333 many wouldn't bother|pg||

nt|bobholl: it is like pushing a lot of breath out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  3@D was typo|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|bobholl: @D and small @C is too suspicious :)|pg||

nt|mrt2000: think so?|pg||
nt|lml: yes hard to get to dummy and just cashing the @HA is a logical play for -800|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: i think the only way to keep EW out of game is for Martens to PASS throughout|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: but how often would that happen  --- and how many pairs let west bid 3@D |pg||
nt|bobholl: more|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davpro: It wouldn't matter- small or high- Moss would always grab ace and play @c|pg||

nt|caitlin: X takeout|pg||
nt|bobholl: but double was 3@H anyway|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: many Precision players say 1@H is forcing -- not sure if it was here|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT just balanced 15-17. 2NT can be even 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsx: if I try to correct it though you may miss the whole board.. sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 1h showed 4 diamonds.|pg||
nt|lml: this goes for 500 anyway|pg||
nt|mrt2000: EW really haven't got to grips with this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: failure to bid 2@C suggests 1@H could have been 4@H with longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|lml: the worst thing about 6@C is it just might push e-w to slam, probably not now|pg||
nt|lml: ok|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|oosmanb: No need April thanks you're doing a fantastic job!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: rusinow leads my favourite   www.bridgeguys.com|pg||
pc|d6|nt|uni_cicam: dbl can help, but @C lead is still obvious, will Kopecky guess right?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: just 5@D with this hand|pg||

nt|timmy5: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@S!!|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the winner once past 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: if they can stay there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: needs a bit too much for 15-17 for a slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: Since this is such an important match, declarer will try a pseudo squeeze and try to ruff two @D for a miracle|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: very tough hand |pg||
nt|othered1: if south's @SQ were the @CK slam isn't bad at all.|pg||
nt|davpro: 6 tricks for defense...that can't vanish|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Precision when not-vul  Polish Club when vul|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: Hi Taymour welcome|pg||
nt|timmy5: hi Oosman|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: east trying to figure out how the heck he won this trick and what trap the declarer is trying to set up for him...  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT might be a warning bid, anyway here we go|pg||
nt|othered1: Will be faced with same position Hamman misguessed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: tough decision|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: I'm curious, can kibitzers send me a personal message whether they'd play this deal all the way through or just claim -1 and move on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@H was  no 4 card in MAJORS.. and 4@D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@C than 2 down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|timmy5: ill play :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm told 3NT was bid by Pharmaservice, Thank you Mh. Shaker :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As I was saying, for us mere mortals 3NT seems hard to find, but at this level all 32 teams ARE capable of finding the 9 trick cold game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I had pharmaservices this morning.  a very nice pair from Denmark...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: and it has to be N who needs to convince South (due to the 4333 and AA Kxx @H)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|nt|lml: the defence only needs to cash a heart|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but, if they try to get a ruff, probably they have it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|uni_cicam: this will take a while|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: taking by A is winning also againt 4th @D J on side|pg||
nt|othered1: do those good @D spots in dummy have an effect on the decision?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: so yes, they might|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: play the Ace Michal, please :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think this is anything other than a guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck would play the same regardless of who holds the @DJ   and maybe even with @C33|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, I have an option, put 2 cards on the table and hit them. The one which jumps further is the right one. You will be surprised how it works|pg||
nt|lml: they will get the spade eventually|pg||
pc|h7|nt|uni_cicam: YES|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: talking (in Dutch) and laughing|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I can confirm out of the 32 teams with 3 instances to go , ONLY team pharma has found 3NT, WELL DONE. (btw par was 4@DX-1 by EW :) )|pg||
nt|lml: not too worried about the diamond stopper|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: key now -- is Katz PASS forcing?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not sure to win 1NT.....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good view @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the range for 1N response is higher than standard because if 1@D opened with balanced hand it is 11-13 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: 3nt coming|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough is enough |pg||
nt|lml: Arnolds doesnt have extra |pg||
nt|chick: EW are playing precision, so the 1@D is just a generic opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrt2000: there's a good start for the chinese recovery|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps South should have just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry lost contact for 10 minutes or so|pg||
nt|lml: rather than inviting|pg||
nt|chick: the other room didn't get the W hand opening, so here S may have worried that there was no good source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: well the 1NT response from north suggested diamond help|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4th and final 14-board segment for Round of 16 scheduled to begin in 45 minutes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep plays senior events too (pairs only)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i'm too young|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 3NT possible. but needs a divine @D guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: realtime scores for all matches in Rosenblum [Open] R16 and McConnell [Women] R8  at http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if they found the 4@s defence........|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 years ago she was champion |pg||
nt|yvesj49: i eat my hat|pg||
mb|2D|nt|uni_cicam: thanks everyone, will be an exciting last session, hope organizers will put it to the schedule since we did not see second session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure yet which matches will be on vugraph but with this match so close, won't be surprised to see this same matchup|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: and, please, give greetings to the Czechs, everyone is watching and holding fingers|pg||
nt|bobholl: 16 imps on 1 board is a lot |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  not vul    maybe they are playing Polish Club throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then i thought open 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes!|pg||
nt|lml: the OR result looks normal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: no still looks like Precision but slightly different range|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 12-14 nv I think|pg||
nt|bobholl: too strong for 4@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@D is possible with the same guess|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: quite a flat set with some chances for swings, Nickell has biten 11 IMPs from the Martens Pie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator -- please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and thank YOU for the great job|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: 5@D safer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ah yes, I just noticed the @C position. :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: is 5@D a bad contract?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Q drops, MIchal can relax a bit, OR?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C auto splinter marion didn't like that|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not after 4th suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: next segment scheduled to being in 75 minutes [1h15m]|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzsx: 1  over trick only, my mistake.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|uni_cicam: if E is taking @H K by the Ace, there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|timmy5: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I wouldnt mind being in it, (or actually putting partner in it)|pg||
nt|othered1: But doesn't south have to take early discard if he runs all the @C?|pg||
nt|lml: an autobridge hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: and then telling him "you couldve made you know"|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @C finesse now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|uni_cicam: from Kopecky view, double squeeze should work, but will be turned quickly to simple @S @H squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: think netherlands will loose 1 or 2 imp on this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @HQ then a @S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: K@S ruff a @S probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok That's it for this set|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Roland whens the next one?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Timmy you know?|pg||
nt|timmy5: no dear|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok see you guys whenever it is :)|pg||
nt|timmy5: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: next match is about 40 minutes...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: sorry these guys were playing really fast and covering their cards.  Not so easy on the viewgraph ops...  |pg||
nt|othered1: which threat does he throw now?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|uni_cicam: should have played @H K first, now he realized |pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: was an exhausting set for taking such sqeezes, better to save energy|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: hope to see you soon here, bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 4th quarter in about 356 min|pg||

nt|hedyg: not after a small @s from Simons|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: penultimate board here now; start again in about 1 hour|pg||

nt|yvesj49: ty joe|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: netherlands canb only loose on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: can|pg||
nt|lml: and they guessed the spade|pg||
nt|chick: that bid has Arnolds' jaw dropping|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobholl: bit weak in @D for 2nt|pg||
nt|lml: assuming they start with the diamond ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: 4@s|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: missing two 'aces' have to guess it rigth|pg||
nt|lml: I would be very surprised if they dont get to the slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|oosmanb: EW play Polish Club I'm told|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Hi all we are going to have some fun here tonight.  |pg||
nt|davpro: Perhaps, but still the best bid (imho)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: By our very soon Dutch correspondent , van Spoookyyyy, aka Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|oosmanb: own*|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|chick: W may lead the @DA and thereby give away the fact that she has the @SK|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yvesj49: trump lead beats|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: a fredin redouble |pg||
nt|bobholl: i think as jeanharings that they won't bid it missing two 'aces' as i said before|pg||
mb|4N|nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
nt|davpro: a blind lead somehow. Didn't hit the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult and costly lead problem (@DA could be my choice)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
nt|yvesj49: possible to play on @c !!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well she knows they have 11 @S but :(|pg||
nt|chick: doubling for a lead doesn't make a lot of sense when you will be on lead against a slam|pg||
mb|5S|nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
nt|davpro: Moss might be concerned about @d 3-0, but in that case S would probably have led trumps...so he should relax :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: it scares them off :)|pg||
nt|lml: at this vul though East might have cooperated in diamonds with a different hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: begin with @S is bad :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: she did'nt put the 10 ??????|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I like to play that double as a suggestion for a save|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||
nt|spooky: hi Jean|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen up more staring|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi|pg||
nt|chick: that would make more sense to me|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yvesj49: OOPS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no ten|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|yvesj49: incredible|pg||
nt|bobholl: laura is playing bridge not long (3 years or so)\|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oosmanb: 6430 possible?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: probably wouldnt bid 3NT with that! :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|davidstern: Just for my Australian friends watcching: Ish/Ash 61.61% Nye/Bobby 55.62% Michael/Stephen 53.5%|pg||
nt|yvesj49: now it's 1 off|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|davidstern: Sorry but I have been receiving so many requests for pairs results|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot of ways to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no problem David. We like to hear results!!!  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably quite nervous|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: so keycard is a bit of a nuisance on this hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: their time to guide us through this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: as well to the WBF for allowing BBO to broadcast from this prestigious event, especially to Hervé Lustman who has been instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: my pleasure - thanks to the commentators and to the specs|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: back at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|kerasidis: not the best double in my opinnion|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcphee: yeah Dennis I do not like it much|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|kerasidis: will cash extra trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: E wisely puts on the brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: you would like the double if partner was going to lead a small club :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: as it happens 5@H is a great save|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Wang is thinking about the save|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would bid 5 spades after|pg||
nt|hedyg: Pasman unlikely to let her|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: i don't see West bidding 5|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing when you open this hand 2NT and pd transfers to @ss !|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: sorry|pg||
nt|mcphee: you are not fired yet:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: oh we have action here|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: who bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|mcphee: is this bidding right Joe?|pg||
nt|mcphee: even 6 @H a good save|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: shows what I know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: S content to push them to the 5 level|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: as we all would be expecting 1 H and 2 @C tricks:)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 11 i mean|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c2|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: when you dont feel obliged to double 3@h you might get a Q@D lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wonder what if she had not double!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: right Hedy|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: however, as an aside @S may be played from W in the other room|pg||
nt|mcphee: making the @D lead more difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Wangwill be very disappointed when dec turns up with singleton club K|pg||
nt|mcphee: especially when S bids @C|pg||
nt|kerasidis: now south hopes to cash 2 clubs after 2 nt opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you get a @C lead and a @d switch?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so I do not really expect a swing this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: she could just claim, couldn't she?  no hope of an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: no, a heart return|pg||
nt|hedyg: waiting for a @H?|pg||
pc|d4|mc|11|nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now :)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|oosmanb: should be a straight forward 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: depending on style 1NT or 1@S here |pg||
