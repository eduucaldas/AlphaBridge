mb|1C|nt|oosmanb: WOW! fun board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes, declare claimed 12 top tricks.. from Jansma... |pg||
mb|p!|mb|1D|nt|spooky: on this hand you might get to high|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: what's too high?|pg||
nt|spooky: 6 something?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D there|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|spooky: I think Sjoert will bid 6@D at some point|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: W asking 7 -5? or just no to partner|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|spooky: only -1 Oos?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzsx: or the Dutch equivalent|pg||
nt|pelu: the @S-finess looks ok - dont know @Ds 4-1 so he can lose to @SK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: as expected!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes I think this is best. ruffing second one with 10 anyway, so you'll be fine|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
