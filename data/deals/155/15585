mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: what system are NS playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: welcome|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|stc: have you seen the steal of the year ? on 15 Brogeland made SIX @d against Fantunes !!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: i had their card but only long enough to enter their names|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: i missed that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzsu: i dont have their cc|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump shift when this wins|pg||
nt|stc: A@h lead(as most others), and 3 tricks later jumped with the A@d killing partners !k|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|stc: K@d|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can overruff dummy so i suppose diamond continuation ok|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: 2/4 leads for NS apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: told you i didnt have the card for very long :)|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
nt|tokay1975: just 1550|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjorn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: discussions between the norvegians|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|tez: nice bidding |pg||
nt|caitlin: This should be a very interesting match: Greco/Hampson are very good and aggressive.....Duboin and Sementa are very experienced international players|pg||
nt|caitlin: and very successful|pg||
nt|barnets: should be an exciting set|pg||
nt|tlc: hi barnet...welcome back everyone for the final 15 bds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
nt|stc: very good judgement in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|tez: hi sgurbjorn:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|iceking: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: We are underway...session two|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I suspect it is Duboin who is thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes it is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@H looks like some bal 4card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
nt|caitlin: wrong!|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh OK|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Joe our operator:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N EW looks a reasonable effort vulnerable -- whether it will be made is another question|pg||
nt|iceking: hi Ellen :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if he  made   5cl  they win 12  instead of losing 14|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Magnus|pg||
nt|barnets: not an ideal dummy for north|pg||
nt|tlc: no...for sure...|pg||
nt|barnets: but 2@s was cold|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
nt|stc: looks like 11 tricks in NT |pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
nt|kjadams: hi|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: just like we were discussing earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew not used to having ONLY ONE long suit|pg||
nt|barnets: so he is likely to at least break even|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: Had to join you, you looked lonely:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ellen|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tokay1975: tyyy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: play for 3N facing many modest smatterings|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|ritong: hello bill hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like dec has 3 club tricks 2 hearts and 3 diamonds for 8|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: this was a real football game.  We started with Cayne running away with it and Auken shaky|pg||
nt|tez: @s  lead 12|pg||
nt|stc: a sqz @s/@d could bring number 12|pg||
nt|tez: i guess @d lead|pg||
nt|phil:  hi all - on a touchy laptop at daughters swim meet but will try!|pg||
nt|iceking: loser in all suits nothing decl can do |pg||
nt|dburn: well, West may get a heart ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: 6 sure tricks is what they start with|pg||
nt|iceking: hi John|pg||
nt|kjadams: I can help with the Robinson Boyd systems as I play regularly with Steve.|pg||
nt|iceking: cool|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Boyd taking his time..puts hand down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil confidently reached 6@C|pg||
nt|tlc: on 14?|pg||
nt|andersk: the first board was not good for BRAMLEY, had a huge upertunety, and missed it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|ritong: hiya phil|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- yes 14 was bid to 6@C  after natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tokay1975: his judgement  was  very good i thk to bid  5cl |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Anders|pg||
nt|tokay1975: note that  giorgio  duboin bid  4nt  and they were ,in 5h impossible to make|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, looks like at least -200 now|pg||
nt|tlc: but then the spade ruff wont be shut out|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: this is the last board for now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't want to see any bad breaks here|pg||
nt|phil:  hi dude|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tokay1975: i prefer also  4nt but i am not sure which one is  better |pg||
nt|toral5: hello all|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bobh1: the movie says that 6@d made in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: then Auken got a few good results and the momentum shifted.|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you April, great job @H|pg||
nt|stc: the communications are not very good for the sqz |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: North thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: not vul warren|pg||
nt|tlc: hard to duck the @S AKQ there|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, not vul, then won't matter very much|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: thank you Linda :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Sepan|pg||
nt|toral5: sapan.hi caitlin|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|toral5: brb|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: hampson will suspect the singleton heart from the auction -- no NT opening|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: need finesse @c |pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: I like the 4 NT bid too. But Im more conserned about the line of play from this room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now jack of hearts maybe? |pg||
nt|andersk: small @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened an Acol type 3N|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  if he can make  4cl tricks he is safe  thats why i thought he will play jack of hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: he will escape for 1 down for 2 imp pick-up|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|stc: @c, AKQ@h, @s finess, it works|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: I wonder if the score is correct in the CR on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: they fixed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set scheduled to begin in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bobh1: they just changed it to -2|pg||
nt|lml: 6@d was down|pg||
nt|lml: a big blitz|pg||
nt|lml: congratulations to the Rayner team and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|lml: I hope I can be watching both in the finals!|pg||
nt|bobh1: thx all c u later|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: see you later. thank you all!|pg||
nt|lml: thanks to the operator who was outstanding|pg||
nt|lml: really great job April|pg||
nt|bobh1: agree|pg||
nt|lml: thanks Bob|pg||
nt|lml: bye now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR returned @c at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores |pg||
nt|andersk: S has to continiue @C now otherwise the @S can be good or @D trick|pg||
nt|andersk: or 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: tempting to use the Queen, but actually no need|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|tlc: thx all for letting me join the party..a wild bunch of hands!|pg||
nt|andersk: 3x@h now and @C A @C to 10 @S will endplay North|pg||
nt|phil:  did we get the result on the appeal?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 75 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's over now|pg||
nt|bessi2: but will he take the spade finesse |pg||
nt|barnets: east can get athird club trick now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: Thanks Hedy it was fun and thanks Kitty and April the wonderufl operator|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks specs for joining, we hope you enjoy the show|pg||
nt|lml: and thanks to BBO and all the spectators|pg||
nt|lml: I love BBO Vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: be back later.  thank you all.  |pg||
nt|lml: bye|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: when west plays a spade|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  small @h to board|pg||
nt|andersk: risky, since North might have Qxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|warrens:  heart ruff and a spade through for a trump promotion, so down 2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: for tomorrow's schedule with your local times   http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i did not|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|nt|andersk: looks like he will get the line anyway|pg||

nt|lml: he|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: and good morning|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|stc: Our two teams are 3rd and 4th separated by 1 VP|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up for Lavazza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South has quite a hand|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H is flannery...|pg||
nt|barnets: here is a lucky 3N E/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: and an opening |pg||
nt|xenya: after the 1@S overcall by S 3N had very little chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Precision 2@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4414 or (43)15 shape|pg||
nt|iceking: Boyd might check on pds shape and settle for 3nt |pg||
nt|Gerben42: good evening :)|pg||
nt|iceking: if north has 4-5-1-3 shape he would like to be in 3nt i would assume|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3C is limit + in hearts, might start with that.|pg||
nt|barnets: 22hcp but 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: i bet it was different some decades ago|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it was a bad lead though|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting use of rdbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|xenya: Moss rightly felt that strong measures were called for|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting to open S hand 2N|pg||
nt|tez: unlucky 6@d|pg||
nt|toral5: back|pg||
nt|xenya: probably support double from N|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes alerted as such|pg||
nt|toral5: heading towards an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya:  aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|xenya: by NS|pg||
nt|caitlin: so 2@H raise of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: transfers after the D, so RD = hearts, 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|phil:  I like "4415" shape....less one|pg||
nt|kjadams: or blast :-)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: almost as simple bidding as in the other room - I guess Boyd felt @SKJ was kinda nice|pg||
nt|iceking: i think its little lazy |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still talking about last hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: yes much more to be gained if he was right than to lose|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhere|pg||
nt|bjacobs: cute|pg||
nt|iceking: 10 tricks not much in the play|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
nt|andersk: Normally a game bid and won at both tables, with players with theese skills|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
nt|toral5: seems supp x is mandatory in thr methods.opened with less than 11 and now a supp x|pg||
mb|4C|nt|stc: very tricky, splits not friendly for NS but good finesses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably South knows which by now ... sand has a decision to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
nt|ritong: mysterious bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He goes for the spade game ... rather than 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
nt|tokay1975: is morgan thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ok its free  :)))|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to his partner:)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: his pd  has 4 aces with 19  count and still his hand  cannot mnake 5|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even 4 is  problem that  cl ace in onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@D might well be the "end signal", meaning: "partner, bid 4@H then pass my next bid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
nt|tez: makebl 6@d with open cards..but...|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see any scenario where finessing in spades is the right play|pg||
nt|stc: but to make 6@d you need all finesses !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will just count on diamonds 3-2.. ruffing one spade and discarding one, intending to give up the K of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
nt|toral5: an expected push|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S was down2 |pg||
nt|dburn: same number in four diamonds, if South can find the defence|pg||
nt|warrens:  I guess it didn't occur to Rosenberg to bid 3nt on Jxx of @S:)|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of spades, three rounds of hearts...|pg||
nt|barnets: yes @HA|pg||
nt|tlc: this is making unless hearts are led very early|pg||
nt|barnets: or @SA and heart switch|pg||
nt|barnets: south will score his @D|pg||
nt|barnets: on a ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A common technique in the relay community|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good|pg||
nt|barnets: I think he will find this defense|pg||
nt|dburn: and the rest of it is not even particularly far-fetched|pg||
nt|tlc: i do too...levin wishes he had a higher spade spot im sure|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|stc: sure, this is the normal line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: the board came very quickly back to South...lol|pg||
nt|tez: pelle bid good IMO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now some more thinking|pg||
nt|tez: 5@D= i have nothing|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure what south is considering.. grand out of the question at this point and passing 5d is unthinkable|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. maybe not unthinkable.. his pd could have kqjxxx kqxx in hearts and clubs i suppose|pg||
nt|tez: we are sure camberos will try 7|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 4@h/@s would be encouraging|pg||
nt|phil:  but South should play this and put the hand everyone knows about on the table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: perhaps, depends on their methods.  It's quite a cool concept which can be used in any system where one player is in control of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: w thinking|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|warrens:  Levin's card will be suit preference, but I think Weinstein will read the 4, especially given the bidding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||
nt|lml: Solani is sort of endplayed but he can get out a spade|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if a strip and endplay is the best line|pg||
nt|tez: nice bid|pg||
nt|stc: on non trump lead the @s finesse looks ok, why not|pg||
nt|bessi2: perhaps a 4@c bid from camberos would have been a better bid instead of 4@d.. gives his pd a chance to bid 4@d|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: on this lead some chances|pg||
nt|stc: but you have to choose the right side|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead auto|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tlc: well done|pg||

nt|tez: he cant lead singleton trump in this squence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||
nt|barnets: so this is a good result n/s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: bathurst is going down with the diamond offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry these guys are fast. |pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@D seems a good result here|pg||
nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
nt|barnets: but they will gain only 3 imps|pg||
mc|9|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not much to do here, except go down|pg||
nt|barnets: with n/s playinng 2@H down 1|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|lml: it could be made if declarer tried to set up hearts and used all entries to do so|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|stc: yes, no reason to finesse in NT and not much play in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=863&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is a match between 1st and 2nd in group J|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4 first team qualify for the KO stage, i believe|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
nt|phil:  even if onside|pg||
nt|dburn: never mind - if they win 3 IMPs on every board from now on, they will win the match|pg||
nt|barnets: better to push that thin game than the one they tried|pg||
nt|barnets: it often happens that way|pg||
nt|tlc: an interesting subtlety in the auction...rosenberg bid 2@d, instead of 2@c, because he had enough values to want to compete if the oppoenents bid more....this allowed a cheaper 3@c ...|pg||
nt|tlc: rebid...with a terrible hand he would have likely bid 2@c immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|bt: i was wrong hi ruff then pull trumphs was good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: monster hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is a RR match in the Rosenblum Cup (open world champs)|pg||
nt|lml: good morning from Canada|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|lml: I am quite happy to walk in and see Canada is leading|pg||
nt|andyv:  did I miss something?|pg||
nt|andersk: Can East have 5332 with @C A and pass opening hand, and W not bid with AQJxxx in @C?  I doubt it, so E need to have a @C honor, then surely a low honor|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: sorry specs we do appear to have tech problems here|pg||
nt|mamos: we are tryong to find out what is happening onsite   sorry for delay all|pg||
nt|Jacki: Herve is on his way to this match folks, he'll get it fixed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: herve's speaking  I will catch up bidding and play here|pg||
nt|mamos: and from England|pg||
nt|gulyas: also from Hungary|pg||
nt|mamos: yes this is Group F  (of 16)|pg||
nt|blum1956: weak NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
nt|bt: not a classic 2bid but effective here|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: accepted|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see. North is on lead to 3NT and will probably lead a spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: decent 3N here for n-s but unmakeable with the club ace in the east hand|pg||
nt|phil:  (undo)|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|iceking: most pairs cant bid 1nt here with Nickells hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
nt|iceking: either it shows 3 card support or its transfer, for them it looks like semi forcing |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: reluctant pass by Nickell|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: boring hand now|pg||
nt|iceking: Nickell might bal with 2@S but pass is fair also|pg||
nt|iceking: everything breaks well, declerar will end up with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: so we start with 3 rather dull hands, lets hope things will spice up a little|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S would gain/save a couple imps as 7 tricks probable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That gets declarer up to 8 tricks, but I can't see a 9th|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4d is one heck of a bid in that spot in my opinion|pg||
nt|tez: q of @h|pg||
nt|xenya: this might have issues...|pg||
nt|xenya: but makes perhaps if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: duboin will start with his natural @H q|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
nt|bt: its a little aggressive imho|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I like the dbl either.. prefer 2N even with those lousy heart spots|pg||
nt|bt: 2n is a slight underbid, so i understand the double|pg||
nt|bessi2: but with only +50 or 100 defending 3h on the menu.. -100 in 5d surely nothing to be concerned about|pg||
nt|bt: this is heading for one down unless west gets stuck with the @C J in some variations|pg||
nt|bt: @S A, @HA @H ruff, diamond, @H ruff diamond, @S, @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n asking question of e|pg||
nt|tlc: im not sure i follow this auction...|pg||
nt|barnets: suggested that 1n was clubs|pg||
nt|tlc: ok..comes the dawn |pg||
nt|barnets: that would make sense|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
nt|phil:  lost a valuable tempo|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One tempo gone - there better be a spade switch coming!|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N shows either clubs or exactly 2533|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what this bidding was - maybe 1NT was "clubs or balanced", some sort of transfer rebid structure where West had to lie somehow|pg||
nt|barnets: cards lie very nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe West was just telling the truth and East hoped for hearts and clubs or to survive the actual shape|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it was a option |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
nt|bt: then on @C to king west can unblock|pg||
nt|tez: ty:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
nt|toral5: @D q10 falling are also gud news for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes -- i missed that|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|toral5: looks like a comfortable make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco asks about count signals|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
nt|phil:  430 or 400?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stc: 17 a push after identical play in both rooms|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Pellegrini in the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness|pg||
nt|bessi2: a diamond now and a heart back might bother declarer|pg||
nt|iceking: on low @S return declerar needs to ruff high in dummy 2 rounds of @C pich spade home |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|stc: @s looks best|pg||
nt|dburn: cards may not lie quite well enough though, even if declarer goes right in trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: spades are best now|pg||
nt|barnets: then north can get  promotion|pg||
nt|barnets: for his trump 10|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
nt|andersk: When you take out 1 NT X, you have already shown 6@S and a weak opening, why do partner bid 3 @D if not force?  I|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tez: if helgemo give @s J ..|pg||
nt|tez: GAVE|pg||
nt|toral5: ruff @H and 2 high trumps;so 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|toral5: his worry should be an @H over ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: another heart may be best|pg||
nt|barnets: south also threatems a promotion|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||
nt|tez: he belived @s's are 3/3 now|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looked that way|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh disaster for lavazza in the other room|pg||
nt|toral5: so losing 12 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he had out the @H9 then switched to the @C3|pg||
nt|caitlin: to see other room www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: south has promotion now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: yes|pg||
nt|stc: here @h was better, puting some pressure on dec|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: I think you are seeded if you are a bit good|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|toral5: match will be tied now|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think @H 9 guranteed 8 tricks, so he decided to increase his chances in case @CA is with W |pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: greco apologized for taking solong|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|tlc: yes..club 10 can be promoted as well|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|barnets: with 3 trump tricks n/s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: Pepsi should be Jacek Pszczola, the World Champion|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: but the legitimate way to make the contract is for declarer to play west for ax in clubs|pg||
nt|bt: north forgot to unblock @D9, beer card not important in china?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mamos: ok  safely done|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to allow for 4-1 break in both black suits|pg||
nt|lml: the rules are probably somewhere on the wbf site or maybe easier to find on ecatsbridge.com|pg||
nt|dburn: mayeb down three, if East pitches now in an attempt to make it somehow|pg||
nt|tlc: mb 3 now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|bessi2: anyways.. 99.9% certain Lev will unblock club Jack if it comes to that|pg||
nt|bt: now north knows 55 in east|pg||
nt|bt: if theyre in rd of 32 they know|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer tries to go for the misdefense here then he doesn't know Lev well I should think|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: a double squeeze?|pg||
nt|lml: no double squeeze|pg||
nt|vicky888:  no communication|pg||
nt|lml: south cant be squeeed |pg||
nt|lml: he has no winners|pg||
nt|toral5: @H ruff is the 8th trick.cos if @H over ruff he doesnt ve the entry to enjoy @C king,EVEN if ace is right|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: needed to cash the @CK for that, and that kills the communication|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bt: if u want them to forget to unblock u should play faster|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|andersk: Andy..pls|pg||
nt|bt: true|pg||
nt|toral5: we do have a super match|pg||
nt|barnets: down by 23\|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: =64|pg||
nt|iceking: 15-17 nt John or|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: as I said at the beginning|pg||
nt|toral5: i missed tht:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whichever, it's a colossal disaster|pg||
nt|phil:  hard to see the spade disappearing but ok|pg||
nt|barnets: chance here n/s|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzsv: 1 s shows 5|pg||
mb|r|an|alerted by W|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||
nt|andersk: would you rather bid 2 @D than penalty double 1 NT?|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh.another 500 in the other room|pg||
nt|warrens:  strange XX imho|pg||
nt|warrens:  but it depends on their agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: may show a long suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: not very exciting in a team match, I have to admit|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a disappointment for North   |pg||
nt|bt: so north played to respect the opps as opposed to the more likely lie and a misplay|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make 3 different games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: also alerted by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/World_Championship/World_Bridge_game-2010_Philadelphia/World_Bridge_Series_2010.html|pg||
nt|andersk: Im told: EW play xfers at this point to show a weak hand or 12+...rdbl is always limited to 10-11|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: though at least he wont be too high which might have happened|pg||
nt|tokay1975:   walid knows for sure  this is forcing he just took the risk with weak hand  .both opp showed some values|pg||
nt|tez: seems 5 card @s..bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against 620 i guess|pg||
nt|phil:  Hampson taking delayed auction with that awkward hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If you told South he could make 5@C, he wouldn't believe you|pg||
nt|phil:  think 2@c is natural in this context?|pg||
nt|iceking: is this correct didnt Katz bal with dbl?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: its clear he thought @h6 was singleton but this was misguided|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will be an easy +620 for Lev|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greco/Hampson great pair and aggressive but Duboin and Sementa have far more international experience|pg||
nt|iceking: thats just 2 passive i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: this is correct|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess he had respect for the strong NT - still, a bit passive|pg||
nt|iceking: way to passive |pg||
nt|iceking: for me and most i would assume this would just be standard bal dbl even vul vs not|pg||
nt|barnets: likely sttle in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this hand will play quite well for north|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d wenz down in OR on the same @h lead !|pg||
nt|xenya: as Ellin said, NS are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S?  Beam me up, Scotty|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vicky888:  helpful lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c checkback, but I believe not GF|pg||
nt|toral5: more imps for @D team|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzsv: fire alarm just went off!!|pg||
nt|iceking: so just making and good result for Robinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: S seem to upgrade his hand|pg||
nt|andersk: next time 3 NT is cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 6@h making but not a sort of perfect contract|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s does make on the previous board of course|pg||
nt|stc: @s now|pg||
nt|phil:  and they land in a Burns fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 1@S seems panicky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: ruling stands on appeal|pg||
nt|phil:  since double is takeout of hearts, why cant 2@c be natch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's as if he is unaware of E/W's system, where 1@C can easily be a 2-card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: well judged pass by south|pg||
nt|tlc: a likely +11 for fleisher...|pg||
nt|dburn: this may be OK also - Levin perhaps thought Weinstein would have a less solid spade holding than this|pg||
nt|warrens:  Rosenberg's X=2 @S's and a desire to compete, usually 7+|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petepunt: playing small @H on board 18 seemes strange|pg||
nt|lml: apparently crazy things are happening in the OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx, however, doesn't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, rather, shouldn't|pg||
nt|lml: the OR is in 7@C in the other room but they aren't finished yet|pg||
nt|lml: they are all on steroids|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: www.bridgeblogging.com has the scores. |pg||
nt|bessi2: club ace.. cash 2 spade tricks and revert back to clubs only way to bother declarer it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: still and all, he hasn't make it yet... maybe if West can somehow find a club lead...|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to ruff 2@S in dummy, but with East having only 2 @D's, should be ok|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needs 2 ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|andyv:  this contract appears to be super safe...CR in 3@s making|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bt: i am a big fan of preempting in spades, but i am not sure if it is correct on this eau de cologine hand|pg||
nt|tez: do you overcall with helgemo's hand?|pg||
nt|stc: what about a 3rd @s round ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: or a 3rd spade even|pg||
nt|phil:  you have a q of 2@h on the offchance South has a hand|pg||
nt|barnets: it is helpfull that the @D 10 falls|pg||
nt|barnets: doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: but he could have survived without it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: declerar will lose 3 @S tricks and 2 @C tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andersk: I would prefeer to trust my partner instead of my opponents|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tokay1975:   this is true he just took the risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow I think that EW have played a few times and pretty much know their system:)|pg||
nt|barnets: by drawing a second trump before ruffing a second spade|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: they have doubled 7@C in the OR so we should have a pickup for Canada|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, i retract -- W didn't double 6@D -- he bid 7@C instead|pg||
nt|bt: cologne|pg||
nt|caitlin: no X is big plus for Diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fortunately, with the very friendly position, 2@S may scrape home|pg||
nt|phil:  lead advertises clubs as 2-2 (or 4-0)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's funny - E/W are playing trumps to stop South from getting ruffs.   Little do they know!!|pg||
nt|warrens:  a club to dummy and a small @D now?|pg||
nt|warrens:  best if ducked by West|pg||
nt|barnets: then he could cash his @D A and claim if trumps 3-2 and clubs come in|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'll bet a coke he'll make it, but it will take a while.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|tokay1975: they have been playing together for years|pg||
nt|toral5: we have a new leader now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gulyas: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, N is on the wrong wavelength|pg||
nt|bessi2: but now it will make comfortably|pg||
nt|stc: small defense error(@c before 2nd @s)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos thinking|pg||
nt|tez: bi-color hands are very valuable after finding a fit|pg||
nt|stc: here the fit is "moderate"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: still thinking|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: I know East-West and they are pretty sensible |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt certainly helped their cause here -- in a sense|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: in this sequence, there is no fit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bt: and now i wait for the questions? lol|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: we shouldnt see too much mischief from them|pg||
nt|mamos: on Bd 17 the most interesting answer refers to North not having any clear alternative action|pg||
nt|dburn: I don;t think this will work - West can play either minor now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: well, 7@cx is a bit on the naughty side |pg||
nt|toral5: turning out to be a first few gr8 brds for @D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: "No spades partner?" asks North|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stc: not the percentage trump handling here|pg||
nt|andersk: Im getting mixed comments from specs regarding auction on the previous hand, however IMO 3 @D looks forceing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they won cavendish  i thk 2times and lots of success in usa nationals|pg||
nt|andersk: I beleve East too a gut shot by passing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and also best pair of  egypt they are very experienced players|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: did not bat an eye|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Impressive.  But internally, he's going "what the ..."|pg||
nt|warrens:  may not have enough communication|pg||
nt|dburn: and I don't see how he's supposed to avoid losing to West's @d7 one way or another|pg||
nt|barnets: to make the hand I think he had to led the @DQ from hand at trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: now e/w are helpless|pg||
nt|barnets: but if East had the @DK that would not look good|pg||
nt|barnets: after the @DQ he had communication to ruff two spades and get back to hand|pg||
nt|barnets: twice|pg||
nt|tlc: right|pg||
nt|barnets: it was not an impossible play to find but difficult|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: again protecting v 4-1 breaks may cost an imp or 2|pg||
nt|xenya: same 3 down but an 8-imp gain|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: down now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|blum1956: strange play  in trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: first he doubled, then apparently asked for undo|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: he could have survived after a club, if he had just ruffed another heart and played @dAQ - that way, he would make three trumps in dummy, two heart ruffs in hand, four clubs and ...|pg||
nt|dburn: two spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: And N/S have paid out a measly imp for their fun|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry he lead the AC not low club|pg||
nt|blum1956: he probably tried to protect himself from @hQxxxx with North|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|tez: @d now|pg||
nt|stc: was he playing something or just fishing around ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N was a lot easier as the cards lay|pg||

nt|lml: and if you think I am impartial just look at my flag|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  we saw what happened in the last round...  |pg||
nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||
nt|andersk: Reda is telling me RD is unlimited and Elahmady took a chanse passing, I trust reda, he knowes these players better than all of us together:)|pg||
nt|tez: he played hopeless|pg||
nt|phil:  3N might have been fun|pg||
nt|Gerben42: turn it off again then|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if we see nothing happen - everyone has gone outside|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if yout told him he had just won 3 IMPs on the board he would be a greatly relieved man|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: they are not being helpful here. |pg||
nt|tokay1975: 3dia is  for sure  forcing  no need to discuss  about tthgat|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@S here for ew |pg||
nt|barnets: another big chance n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: only problem is bidding it |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: but he needed the 1st round finess then|pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C coming up now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petepunt: need good wriggle after a weak nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: often 4! and 4 card suot |pg||
nt|lml: yes the momentum can certainly change but this is a very steady east-west pair|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3@S was not a good spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime back to board 20....|pg||
nt|tokay1975: %100 forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1 - 2 - 4 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  9 as per the movie|pg||
nt|lml: I have never ever seen them get rattled|pg||
nt|iceking: yes if you use drury here 2@S is fine|pg||
nt|barnets: this time I think they will take it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: ns is precision style clubbers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ok  so specs we are just catching up here   no biddiing ust results|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: we are suffering a technical problem im fixing it|pg||
nt|mamos: the only swing so far was on Board 18   a real monster  - East at this table made a real error in defence of 6@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@C and 4 higher|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 5@C|pg||
nt|toral5: greco will probably bid 3@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|stc: weak NT produces interesting situations|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good vul game and it will make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly mmisfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with no particular fits this hand is headed to 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry corrected now|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 NT good/bad now?|pg||
nt|xenya: S needs little from N for 5@C to be a good contract|pg||
nt|phil:  4@s has problems on a heart lead - otherwise skates home|pg||
mb|3C|nt|blum1956: anyway 2@h looks like a standard contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42: drury is one of those conventions a modern player can hardly do without it seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: that's how you get to 4S|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is rock solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT again|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they will try for more|pg||
nt|stc: last spot to go +|pg||
nt|andersk: I like this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for north.if he dutifully bids 3nt,@S suit is exposed|pg||
nt|xenya: just 4 cards in clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Studied understatement Phil - on a heart lead it looks doomed|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceking: true good convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: nope|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S would have been down 2 on best defence|pg||
nt|toral5: same contract in other room?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I like your caution - good commentary technique|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: just not many tricks |pg||
nt|tokay1975: just made 2nt |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes same contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: not very exciting again|pg||
nt|lml: this is a coffee break hand for sure|pg||
nt|stc: 6,7 @s are good cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Cunning lead. I believe Drijver did a similar thing against Bocchi some years ago in an Olympiad - Bocchi got the suit wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: Teatime in England :)|pg||
nt|lml: Results from this event are at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm|pg||
nt|bt: west will lead a club and declarer will play on diamonds after running it to the 9|pg||
nt|bessi2: it sure looks like a strong club auction to me|pg||
nt|barnets: souths hearts are better than north thinks|pg||
nt|dburn: again, though, Levin may think he is supposed to bid on after 3NT - should partner really have all this in hearts?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: declarer wasn't fooled by the lead|pg||
nt|tez: i mean..he played without any hope|pg||
nt|toral5: should 3@D on 3@C be treated as forcing?or ONLY 6-5 better hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: not forcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: must be tempting to try a third D, but that allows overtrick.|pg||
nt|barnets: and norths spades are better than south thinks|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he should and spades was what he was really worried about|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|phil:  Bill I have said so many wrong things in VG that I couch everything  (except what I just said :))|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer will reach dummy with a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|barnets: as west has to duck the first round|pg||
nt|barnets: the question is if the defense can come to 1 heart 1 diamond 1 spade and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl dummy i think this can be beat..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Willenken out of the room|pg||
nt|dburn: at double dummy, I guess West can win the first spade - and on the bidding and after the first trick, that's not impossible at all|pg||
nt|barnets: it will be helpful to west when east cant beat dummys @H10 |pg||
nt|dburn: declarer will, after all, be marked with a singleton spade when East does not play an honor on the first round of hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: he will give count|pg||
nt|tlc: then return heart..duck first club and then lead diamond when in with club..win D, shift back to hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: but he still does not know south has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now we are ready agaibn|pg||
nt|barnets: remeber jhe opened 1@D not 1@C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: 3@H cue is stronger bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H was almost GF|pg||
nt|xenya: at least N had no difficulty bidding 5|pg||
nt|toral5: @S ace not known yet.declarer does have problems|pg||
nt|xenya: if N happened to have an ace, he would have cuebid, then S bids 6 i think|pg||
nt|toral5: may be if he leads @S now,@D finesse will be marked|pg||
nt|toral5: in lieu of sementas 1@H opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: though with 3rd seat opening, no guarantees|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: my friend points out:if 3@H is near gf,wt is 4@D suppose to be on 3@C?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: might be key card for some pairs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, ditto|pg||
nt|phil:  out of the blue double? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I doubt this contract is actually doubled ... so am expecting a flat board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no it is x|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil:  well they did walk it into 4@s...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|toral5: 6-3@D fit can be easily missed playing auto keys in the form of 4@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt: i think 2@s GOES 1 OFF BUT would age them 10 years in def!|pg||
nt|tez: he is very good player|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Gold must have seen the DVDi|pg||
nt|lml: Thurston and Willis in the OR are also very steady players.  Not spectacular but few errors|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how declarer can get to 10 tricks here -- well, maybe with a little help from the opposition...|pg||
nt|xenya: N's @H9 may be a big card|pg||
nt|mamos: no may about it  :)  it's a BIG card|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm talking double-dummy though -- down 2 is not out of the question|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|d7|nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|mamos: its just not obvious how declarer should even set about trying to make cards|pg||
nt|iceking: cant blame Steve it looked like best shot |pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: 4@D is bidding shape imho|pg||

nt|bessi2: or 5@c maybe|pg||
nt|tlc: a very hard earned push|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: 20/20|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|lml: is this the right board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Two missing passes?|pg||
nt|xenya: we are missing two passes i think|pg||
nt|caitlin: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|toral5: another push coming up|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good point Boyd took some time before he played @D Q in trick 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S alerted suggests its intermediate|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@S looks like sound 2 could be 10-13hcp but iam just guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Bapat has a tough bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: West probably feels he doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|vicky888:  yess,  maybe 1n|pg||
nt|lml: he wont pass|pg||
nt|lml: he can always raise diamonds|pg||
nt|blum1956: beautiful 6@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: surely the only 2 options I should think|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2s = 10-12, could have side 4 card heart suit.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10-13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: can't see alerts...sorry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: 1NT seems possible...yep|pg||
nt|andersk: This should be an easy 4@H  If they bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 20 a moral victory this set for Bramley squad|pg||
nt|phil:  sorry - flaky wifi|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3D = hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: with takout dbl from east iam not sure Boyd should be bidding here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i doubt that he should - dont think Nickell was going to sit but now...|pg||
nt|iceking: but its fair maybe he didnt want to defend vs 3@C or 3@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: no one seems able to get hold of this match  chance for EW to bid a slam here|pg||
nt|bt: 4@C is more succesful here but i am stubborn :-)|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will make unless they manage to cash the ace of @h in time|pg||
nt|ritong: i wondered, phil  what is a swim meet?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzsv: I entered only final contrqct qnd score we will catch uo soon|pg||
nt|mamos: to explain for new specs e have had problems  ust catching up   normal service soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  by W|pg||
mb|3C|nt|petepunt: tough to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: pass here could be played in few ways, iam not sure how they play it|pg||
nt|passell: will Willenken let him off the hook here is the question|pg||
nt|tlc: would everyone else DBL with levin's hand..or rebid 1NT instead?|pg||
nt|barnets: 1N for me|pg||
nt|passell: 1nt is very dangerous|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mamos: he'll wish hed supported Diamonds now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  i m not sure 2d in place of 1n would show the strength he holds|pg||
nt|lml: a surprise lead|pg||
nt|lml: but actually diamonds is the better spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably Lev was too conservative|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3@dX may bring 800|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@C is my choise|pg||
nt|passell: passed partner couldnt bid over 1d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: asked from 4 Y|pg||
nt|lml: he chose to open a lead directing club rather than his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand was nightmarish for EW -- think we can expect a minus from the other room as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should bid 4@h now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andersk: 4@H is righthanded now|pg||
nt|stc: camberos runing out of boards|pg||
nt|bg: Hi all|pg||
nt|phil:  sounds like a singles event, i know :)|pg||
nt|ritong: naah:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S P 3H would have been game forcing with 6+ hearts.|pg||
nt|iceking: can he make this on @C lead |pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this can be defeated and probably will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get to 4@S|pg||
nt|andersk: only 9 tricks if played in W with a @C lead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: pass denied 2 hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: best is duck this and hope they play 3 rounds of diamond|pg||
nt|kjadams: Pass also denied really good spades.   The transfer is not 100% forced.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Katz will try to avoid declarer shortening his trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: then he can ruff home, enter @C ace finesse @H and play 3 rounds of @S ruff home and exit in @C|pg||
nt|iceking: first he has to duck this |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry about that |pg||
nt|andersk: Jxxx can be enuff|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you need luck|pg||
nt|tez: very hard to beat|pg||
nt|warrens:  especially at unfav|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: excellent slam for EW now, with all their honours working|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, finally a good pick up for Bramley|pg||
nt|passell: between pass and dbl for me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: np|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there are some interesting options on different retunrs from Katz|pg||
nt|warrens:  this lead will make much easier for declarer|pg||
nt|warrens:  it |pg||
nt|barnets: well he had to bid to save the board|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: sensible facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|stc: just cash the first 5 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: seems to me as a serious 3nt;seeking a minor cue from sementa|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andersk: I would not risk pass here|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Bruce|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|tez: sry..i mean to 3@c|pg||
nt|barnets: otherwise he would lose a swing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: same answer, cash the first 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: now he has wrong timing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: cute he ducked the doubleton @DK confident he would get it anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: waiting for the photographer to finish before he does anything.|pg||
nt|bg: HI Vlad|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: if the difference is maintained, the teams are tied|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 147 apiece|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead to 3@c from N|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to trust partner|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mamos: we would have expected them to bid that|pg||
nt|bg: note that Hampson doesnt bother with a bad suit vul preempt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: on the previous board, EW in the other room reached 3N -- also 3 down|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: what would partner bid with: xx, 10xxxxx, xx,xxx?|pg||
nt|bt: so the cautious 4@C was a winner, i predict a few imps for mahaffey here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: not an easy lead for Levin at all - was trying to give nothing away, because the opponents seemed to have bid and supported diamonds and @dA was likely to be in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: North has to sort out that they can cash clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: North might have done better to cash top Club at trick One before playing Heart|pg||
nt|vicky888:  it is inevitable now but to cash two top clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores in all groups|pg||
nt|lml: actually it is a link to swan bridge|pg||
nt|lml: which has the running scores... either place will do|pg||
nt|petepunt: lev only has worjking 9 count and east cant really mve over 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i believe the safety play in trumps here is !K, then small to the 9|pg||
nt|yuval10: will likely play K@d and @s to the Ace, following the opening by S|pg||
nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on agreements but in this same auction, 4@h without blinking... I'm not sure why E didn't bid 4 with present hand|pg||
nt|xenya: only at these colours i bet :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caitlin: why??|pg||
nt|kjadams: win club, 3 rounds of spades ruffing, exit diamond would work.|pg||
nt|tlc: DBL is not entirely safe either...if the opps RDBL, you can still go for a number|pg||
pc|c8|nt|toral5: nice finesse:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|andersk: Im sure they will discuss this board later today|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @h?or @d ace?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|passell: yes as much as I love to bid passing is certainly a possibility|pg||
mc|9|nt|iceking: no east can just cash his winners and leave Boyd with trumps in hand|pg||
nt|kjadams: need heart 9 strangely is entry if defense shifts to trumps.|pg||
nt|iceking: aha there is that @H 9 in dummy correct|pg||
nt|warrens:  this will be 5 very valuable imps for Wolfson|pg||
nt|dburn: true, but you can't just sit there and pass with 18 Miltons|pg||
nt|barnets: well put|pg||

nt|tejjyid: can only bid 6 with mirrors|pg||
nt|andersk: I also agree 3 @h, but I will never risk pass witW hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, if his pd had simply an invite hand, he'd bid 3@h... his 3@d says he has an even bigger hand... now QJ10xx is a great suit|pg||
nt|bt: cashing @DA would have been costly if east holding was T97 ...|pg||
nt|stc: I have 7 red cards and 6 black ones, an omen to lead a red :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: risky doesnt need that finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: my fault -- no practice finesse|pg||
nt|iceking: anyway Boyd should have done better here in the play|pg||

nt|ritong: lots=8, but with his "hand", is not that bad|pg||
nt|phil:  2@c alerted?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: one philosophy is to find the right suit as opposed to the right level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: now these don't fit as well|pg||
nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|tez: i love support dbl:)|pg||
nt|phil:  @c + higher perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: xx alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: hide, Roland, hide|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petepunt: 1¬C shows 11-16 on this auction (1516 )|pg||
nt|lml: this will be quite a challenge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@H EW  - diamond lead gives a few problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you would be right:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Even by East - it doesn't matter after the 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see a way to make this but lets see|pg||
nt|lml: ducking this might be a start|pg||
nt|lml: the longer he thinkgs the more likely he is to get a diamond shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: often during the bidding alerts consist of pointing to the card.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS play standard count |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: typically an explaination isnt provided until end of auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they just point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: and write notes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: and king demands count|pg||
nt|bessi2: 5@d is a very good contract but will fail unless declarer has x-ray vision |pg||
nt|caitlin: 1@D could be 2+|pg||
nt|bg: 2 H good treatment shows 5-4 weak in majors|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|bjacobs: tough call for East|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vicky888:  :)|pg||
nt|phil:  sotm x? |pg||
nt|ritong: in good company, pointing means " it s artificial", displaying the alert card means " beware it s highly artif"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and he finds a choice that no one will understand, possibly including himself|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toral5: helping lead for hampson.trump lead wd have been interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can just imagine Sadek thinking: "what the hell am I meant to do now?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: he wrote a note|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzsv: Board 23 actually in play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ended in 5@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EAst should bid more here; 3@H was conservative;4@H was extremely conservative|pg||
nt|petepunt: east is very good for auction,  i assume he would bid 2@S with a 16_+ 1@C hand|pg||
nt|mamos: can anyone see a way of making 12?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like they are going to reach 6 here|pg||
nt|bt: so the lead will tell south who has @SAK, then a club finesse and the !K is placed, what is east doubling on??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: thinking is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: picked up cards and looked again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: looking at your cards is good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: they did not change|pg||
nt|barnets: with the lie of the @S suit east has to cover the @S9 with the 10 to promote the 6|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@h showing 15+ 5@c4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: i expect them to bid slam|pg||
nt|tlc: flannery worked out well on this hand...north never could know that South had anything and didn'd overbid..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: best to be on the safe side|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  with 6 tricks off the top, declarer should make his contract, thus another swing for Lavazza team|pg||
nt|caitlin: I gather Pietro Forquet is in spec......pls join us commentating|pg||
nt|toral5: queens are co-operating wel here|pg||
nt|bg: if he happens to cash AK Dia and Ak spades he will make 4|pg||
nt|toral5: wlcm to the legend pietro forquet;and my favourite bridge player:)|pg||
nt|toral5: dont think he can make 4.1@S,1@C and 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tez: if there were just one right, we would all play that|pg||
nt|tlc: in fact, south might not have even had 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w still have 2 trump tricks and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Rosenberg thinking, motionless|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like they will make exactly 2 for 5 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: and bring the margin down to 20|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 1-4 halfway -- very tight match|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a @D after 2 trumps ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: but still.... extremely tough to do I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tez: that's why bridge is great|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: his hand is better than that though, all honours concentrated|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|stc: so, E described his hand...|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are pretty limited as to how to play the hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: When North did not (strangely) overcall 1@S on the previous board they did not get to the spade game|pg||
nt|stc: HH are putting pressure on each board, very hard to play against them|pg||
nt|barnets: the fleisher team won the US team trials and will represent them in next years bermuda bowl|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: now it remains to make it|pg||
nt|mamos: ok this will be interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: but not quick I guess|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I wonder about north's 4N bid.. could surely be a big winner but with 2 aces including a singleton ace on lead...|pg||

nt|gulyas: looks like 8 tricks from top, and maybe a slow @S winner, but he may not get there|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S??|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody forgot their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sorry for the delay, I can only see 1 side of the screen.|pg||
nt|vicky888:  definitely getting penalized heavily|pg||
nt|petepunt: another 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: weak no shape or strong|pg||
nt|xenya: intermediate 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S shows a good opening bid. |pg||
nt|lml: fair enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pinot Noir are leadong Apteker 30-0 and are in second place |pg||
nt|bjacobs: tough call for West|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: i d vent 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: asking for a stopper - has merit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: spreading and closing hnad|pg||
nt|bjacobs: another possibility is 4NT, committing to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: each one of these plyer do something diff|pg||
nt|iceking: is 3@H invitational John|pg||
nt|kjadams: no forcing|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2H would be non forcing free bid.|pg||
nt|kjadams: and a negative double maxes at 5 hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|mamos: are they about to be rescued|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some discussion, i cant hear|pg||
nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
nt|tez: very diciplined 3@h opening:)|pg||
nt|iceking: aha so 3@H gf|pg||
nt|barnets: now it was very dangerous for east to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: thus his pass|pg||
nt|tlc: conservative pass by rosenberg..|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: good thing screen up|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but he goes with a more cautious alternative ... 3@D is probably a constructive bid (using Lebensohl for the weak hands), but is it enough?|pg||
nt|barnets: over 1@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  I thought he would double|pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@h in this vuln|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 6N|pg||
nt|toral5: kibs saying 6nt in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: just open www.bbotv.com/vugraph|pg||
nt|xenya: 6N is superiour to 6@S|pg||
nt|iceking: Nickell with poor def and 6-4 shape should bid on after pd support him on 3rd level |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||
nt|lml: these guys have played together forever so they probably do no what it means|pg||
nt|iceking: but he was very right not doing so|pg||
nt|iceking: but i still dont like it|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes.  I'd have been wrong too.|pg||
nt|tlc: but certainly reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: yes suit not strong, hard to read writing|pg||
nt|stc: Nunes passed but he also landed in 4@h !|pg||
nt|tez: fantonies dont play weak 2|pg||
nt|bg: looks good to us but how to play at table?|pg||
nt|toral5: both 6@S and 6nt is dependent on guessing @S queen|pg||
nt|xenya: or not -- sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stc: N thinking about Christmas|pg||
nt|bt: this is a bordeline balancing 3@C i think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: 4@s from E is very easy if W showed opening values|pg||
nt|caitlin: South African transfer|pg||
nt|toral5: how superior?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  this auction gives W a much better view of E's hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and the opportunity goes begging.  Mind you, game does need a finesse through the weak two bidder|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: and 6+ @s's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 6n might go down a lot if things go badly|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch.13 away;unless open room misguesses the @S suit|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: EW  are likely to make a fair gain in any case|pg||
nt|stc: and eastern in the same time|pg||
nt|blum1956: Weak NT working!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Should've been thinking about his lead instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: looking like 800|pg||
nt|blum1956: The innocent 1@d opening with the North hand would have costed NS a lot |pg||
nt|blum1956: as compared to the weak NT|pg||
nt|stc: Weak NT is war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: punch thinking about the whole hand, not just this play|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe k@S or 8@S is the choice|pg||
nt|stc: not best lead|pg||
nt|iceking: it looks like 2 down |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  and still couldn't get to game|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: we are ok now live now|pg||

pc|c6|nt|dburn: they may make five spade tricks now|pg||

pc|c3|nt|petepunt: 800 on @C lead only|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: Im not sure that was the right result. they said 6. |pg||
nt|vicky888:  it has to be down 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: it looked like -6, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know that letting opps play comfortable 2 level partscores is winning bridge at any form of scoring|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: all back now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess Sadek hated his doubleton heart, which was rather likely to be opposite a doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42: compared to 6-3, 7 IMPs is a big swing indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes:)|pg||
nt|iceking: not much has really happened this session|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: it did seem unlikely that East had tried to casg the wrong Black Ace|pg||
nt|blum1956: 35!|pg||
nt|stc: 14 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend says whole different ball game. both agreed cant make 4|pg||
nt|lml: dont think you can make 4@S but 3NT was good if you could get there|pg||
nt|mamos: suddenly the Diamond team has a 30 imp lead|pg||
nt|xenya: more imps to Diamond here, who all of suuden have moved into a commanding lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this doesnt look very exciting either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: I have to ask if opponents allowed to play 4S undoubled after the 3H call.   Not sure.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: 1@D-1@H; 2@D-3N???|pg||
nt|bjacobs: as indeed it was, but ...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT likely a transfer again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: nobody's asking|pg||
nt|iceking: last time they bid 1nt it was just natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the cards are still big|pg||
nt|andyv:  neg. dlbl by W anyone?|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|blum1956: 5 EW high card points not working as both finesses stay|pg||

nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's one:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5 matches are close or very close|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: lol  spec suggests 7NT +2|pg||

nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: you arrive as EW have a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Richie would just bid the cold 7NT|pg||
nt|reisig: shld be easy to reach 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||
nt|yuval10: won't be so easy to beat this one|pg||
nt|mamos: im having connection probs   sorry everyone|pg||

nt|reisig: HATE IT|pg||
nt|mamos: not me|pg||
nt|reisig: But --- Huston will bid more|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C is 16+ so S looking ofr possible grand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty contract|pg||
nt|caitlin: they won Spingold, 4 of them on Buffet Cup for U.S which won......so in good spirits I would think|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed if you check board 18 it seems they dont play transfers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
nt|tlc: this is the only close match still going on..although Nickel proved you don't need to be real close, just within theoretical striking distance|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's contradicts Bird's law|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@H asking for @SQ |pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer will need to guess spades for his contract|pg||
nt|iceking: this will make 12 tricks |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yess!!!  RR|pg||
nt|mamos: im told NS like the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South hasn't got it, but he thinks @SJ10xx is enough?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: i would not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
nt|toral5: no game makes here|pg||
nt|barnets: west want east to declarer 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 2@H was invitational|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards are 2@H also has a lot of play|pg||
nt|Gerben42: commentator curse|pg||
nt|iceking: yes but he should play trumps in trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: nice bid transfers the contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bt: and west will lead a club, given east did not overcal 1@S hence no 5-suit there|pg||
nt|ritong: no key missing, pard enthusiastic  let s go|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sadek is not happy|pg||
nt|barnets: east wants west to dec 3n that should be|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff trump Q|pg||
nt|ritong: bleh|pg||
nt|iceking: this is just misplay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
nt|tez: helness didnt like q of @d|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||
nt|stc: On bad day you find Q10xx@s behind|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says he can make..but we will see:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: open in 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: the @H 8 and @C8 are good stopper cards for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Sadek's majors are death to him|pg||
nt|ritong: he opens the bidding, gets a grand in his er...face, and knows everything goes well for opps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gotta say, this was highly speculative by North ... how could he know that his losers in diamonds and hearts would all be covered|pg||
nt|ritong: pard said " i like my hand", and he has no reason to hate his|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But should grand slams be bid on the basis of "I have a nice hand"?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: as any other spot|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vicky888:  the openeing 2@d is weak?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|reisig: I can just see Michael S's face :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk5: A claim would be accepted|pg||
nt|isp: "Bid as you like , make as you can |pg||
nt|gulyas: looks strong to me:)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  but that opening has caused this non-sacrifice|pg||
pc|d9|nt|iceking: then Steve needed to find to cash his @S ace and that was not going to happen|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||
nt|lml: tough defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now, the nice play of @s to the J paid off in the end, even when it virtually costs a trick at the beginning|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: no even if north held the @H 7|pg||
nt|barnets: it would not be enough |pg||
nt|warrens:  he can duck this @h and duck a second one, the North is endplayed into giving him his 9th trick.  of course, he doesn't know the club 9 is falling|pg||
nt|warrens:  then North|pg||
nt|barnets: with heart length north will always be endplayed|pg||

nt|xenya: i must confess i don't understand this defence |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with that statement!|pg||
nt|bt: but 5@C is a posility|pg||
nt|bt: possibility|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 4 boards to go...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: more than 10 imps per board...big ask|pg||
nt|Gerben42: of course you are right - but they do everything to prove us wrong :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: he'd probably underlead diamond and hope for spade through.|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now finally the dealer woke up|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer probably ducked one club then let the jack of @s run.. looks like the best line to me|pg||
nt|bg: s/b a routine spade partial|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: best defense was to lead trump and play trump...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: action here|pg||
nt|tez: what do you open with S'S HAND|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I have had a number of messages saying that a diamod switch cannot cost - probably not |pg||
nt|xenya: E could duck a heart -- but if he wins he should try to find a few quick tricks, not to set up the clubs with no entry|pg||
mb|1S|nt|reisig: I'd open that East hand|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you lose a club you still make 6@C  .... and go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|reisig: 6-4 is very strong (w 2 aces)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks in Hearts|pg||
nt|lml: so like in the previous match a good start and then the mo switched|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c = natural or 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he would have done better to cash clubs first, hoping for an error |pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to restrain himself with this hand|pg||
nt|bt: multi 2@D saving east from a pemaly D in 3@H|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder if south had a penalty dbl available... either way I would pass|pg||
nt|bt: say 2@S-3@H-D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: h shows s|pg||
nt|iceking: yes but it will end here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D opening killed the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: indeed but i still like his opening even it didnt work this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no good deed ever goes unpunished|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with 1-1 in majors it was a good shot|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stc: Lev wondering about all this :)|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if Canada can get it back|pg||
nt|mamos: a normal result i'd expect|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: just kidding |pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: EW may cash the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: slim chance though|pg||
nt|mamos: wow that double is some call|pg||
nt|mamos: what is North supposed to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: N SRY|pg||
nt|ritong: waleed is wondering " are there so many hands with which we make 3NT and not 5 or more @cs"|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is the answer is "no"|pg||
nt|iceking: thx for dummy pd |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h an overbid as N has already denied 4 @hs|pg||
nt|bg: some pairs use 2 sia openings to show a really bad major and save the 2H/S openings for reasonable suits|pg||
nt|bg: Dia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no   4@h seems completely normal|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, but I would prefer to look for a 4-4 spade fit first|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk5: Smolen auction perhaps|pg||
nt|reisig: BUT - if partner had KJx in @s -- we have slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: If you don't have a spade fit, you can get to hearts later|pg||
nt|tez: pass 1@c 1@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks uppish|pg||
nt|barnets: In the other room east bid 3@S over 1@S|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry 2@S over 1@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: and will get a second chance|pg||
nt|lml: they have 25 hcp so 2nt vul might not the favorite|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. many aggressive players would open 3@s with this hand, though I am not one of them|pg||
nt|bessi2: Cohler at this point delighted to be playing only 2@h|pg||
nt|bt: the flaw for a weak 2 is the void and playability in 3 suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but he goes for it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andersk: will lead @S now|pg||
nt|bt: and the flaw of the multi w @S is they have a comfortable 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as they are not forcing declarer a lot in @Ds, he can take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NOW|pg||
nt|andyv:  read map has been given to opps|pg||
nt|andersk: Sadek will use the J to get the picture|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone agree with N's 1NT bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it does help to know your partnership style with these borderline hands|pg||
nt|barnets: and west had an easy pass|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|gulyas: 4-1 trumps could be a problem otherwise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  N should play |pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with 1 NT, however I would bid 3@h instead of 2 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s|pg||
nt|andersk: sometimes partner have 5@D 4@h and sometimes 6@d 5@H|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe they can overcall 2 NT with 65 in red's|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, because they play a weak nt, so it shows 15-17 balanced or less but unbalanced|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petepunt: @H more likey than a low @S here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: low @S should be automatic|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably East should have discarded clubs in the reversed order|pg||
nt|stc: can you beat on @hs ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: showing the spade values|pg||
nt|stc: at IMP @s looks better to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: aagree easts @C should enc in @S if poss|pg||
nt|tlc: i confess i would have bid 3@s|pg||
nt|barnets: it is hard to criticise either east or west here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bessi2: he has a good chance of making this I think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I think S had a simple 2@d rebid... he has a decent hand, a very broken @d suit and needs a lot of help from partner for any game|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: brb|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: well that was a very good counter-move from south|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: but it must be easy for West to work out the underlead anyway|pg||
nt|andersk: I totally agree|pg||
nt|andersk: 2@h is an overbid, but that was not the discussion:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stc: 1@c shows the length but you have no bid on 1@s, 1@d lies but let you bid 2@c afterwards|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: same auction in other room:) so what do I know:)|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You could even have a 5-4 spade fit, and 6-2 in hearts, as I assume they open 1NT with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|reisig: He didn't even try for @ss|pg||
nt|bessi2: I dislike 1@c most of all... think pass is best start,|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: 3N has little chance on a club lead (and careful defence thereafter), but 4@H appears to be cold on this lie|pg||
nt|bessi2: nice defence from south|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Hampson concedes  "even if you pitch a diamond, doesn't matter"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|toral5: thank you hampson:)|pg||
nt|tlc: so, a well needed 6 IMPs to fleisher|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  even lose 3@ds here|pg||

nt|dburn: East may bid anyway|pg||
nt|lml: well we do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will bid that, probably|pg||
nt|dburn: he does have four decent hearts, after all|pg||
nt|lml: so if north passes and East bids 5@H what then|pg||
nt|andyv:  or simple 3@d:)|pg||
nt|iceking: North could think about slam in @D if pd is short in @C|pg||
nt|iceking: AJxx AKxxx xxx x exs |pg||
nt|Gerben42: they must like 2@H p 4@H auction|pg||
nt|kjadams: to quote steve "partner never has the perfect hand"|pg||
nt|iceking: another lazy bid as i see it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bt: ew might take first 10 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|stc: however hard for E to put the K@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  styles matter.. in OR, N bid 1@d and S was able to show his values.  Both rooms reached same contract|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a solid 3nt, just take the double finesse in @S's twice for the 9th trick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|gulyas: they cannot open up both @Cs and @Hs for the defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's X is quite dangerous, given the fact his Partner is the only limited hand in the table, when he already passed|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q|pg||
nt|bt: 3nt 600 ...|pg||
nt|tez: it is highly popular to open 1 nt with a solid color these days|pg||
nt|tez: from 3rd seat with little points|pg||
nt|bessi2: a nice little semi-bluff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well sorry I think NS got to the contract they deserved here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: On this auction dummy rates to be short in spades'|pg||
nt|mamos: it probably won't turn out too badly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 imps on  24 - 4@Cx made EW next door|pg||
nt|lml: this is no fun if you are for Canada ... where is the match I came to watch|pg||
nt|lml: think I am going to get a beverage, I need something... brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "Hope I've got enough" |pg||
nt|yuval10: they started well, until Deutsch responded|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: if @s played from dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: 75 percent|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yuval10: will -1190 be a good result since NS has 1430?  i think not, it isn't so easy to discover the 6@s |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: short break|pg||
nt|barnets: the best line to make 3N is to cash @DK and ace|pg||
nt|barnets: when diamonds are 3-2 |pg||
nt|barnets: then cash the @CA|pg||
nt|barnets: and take 2 spade finesses|pg||
nt|barnets: if diamonds split - 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: then you need to play clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe also start with @DK @D Q|pg||
nt|tlc: yes..need to retain enough entries to take 2 @S finesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we are back|pg||
nt|barnets: can pick @D 10 or J sing in east|pg||
pc|hK|nt|reisig: I guess this isn't one of those ...draw trump and claim hands|pg||
nt|toral5: @C are placed very badly for sementa|pg||
nt|iceking: might play @S now|pg||
nt|iceking: score in this set 6-6 after 8 boards |pg||
nt|Gerben42: so the big swing didnt materialize|pg||
nt|iceking: i was wrong again was just another push|pg||
nt|iceking: he will either continue @D or play @S iam not even sure what is the correct line |pg||
nt|kjadams: seems like letting the rough a diamond helps control.|pg||
nt|kjadams: them..|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see he could take 12 tricks but he will not playf or Jx in @H|pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will play @S it looks right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|stc: looks like .2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q@D dropping N should make this|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @ds aren't 2-2, this hand is not making so finesse for Q should not be an option.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: too early to worry, Linda -- this will lose to 6@S if bid in the other room :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: you hardly have any trumps to draw|pg||
nt|reisig: EW|pg||
nt|reisig: @h is a standout ..now|pg||
nt|stc: -2|pg||
nt|tez: if the spade finesse worked, 3nt would be fine|pg||
nt|barnets: first is find out if diamonds are 3-2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stc: even with @s finess 3NT may go 4-5 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Camberos in the tank|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsv: woooooooooooow|pg||

nt|warrens:  in either hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: if helgamo had bid 3nt, the lead would be @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: Some would rebid the chunky spade suit, but 2@H could have been right|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bg: good stop 4 might make but takes a few good guesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: on last, Greco said he could have invited -- Hamp said he could have passed|pg||
nt|toral5: should be a comfortable make though|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: now he can cash the @Ca before the second @S finesse|pg||

nt|bessi2: horrible result for n-s.. however I don't feel either player did anything awful in the bidding.. only the 2N bid is questionable but reasonable in my opinion|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i think we can congratulate Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: not entirely sure -- play waas very fast|pg||
nt|iceking: and we hve a slam |pg||
nt|barnets: south would have been embarrased |pg||
nt|barnets: had the spade been wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: and the club K fell singleton|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|reisig: maybe should change that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: alerted, but no explaination|pg||
nt|bt: 2n was aggressive but unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: fun fact from bd 25 (where EW were 4@H+2 both room here):|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike this 1@h bid though|pg||
nt|stc: and go to bed ! good night everybody, thanks all including specs and of course players !|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the boards have not been as spectacular by and large as yesterday 3NT looks ver straightforward here|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary plays Hampton|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hungary down 800 in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|bessi2: a clear 4@h bid imo, |pg||
nt|tez: 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: awkward for South|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting to see how NS will handle this|pg||
nt|bt: if it is permitted in their system its fine, other options are worse|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N open|pg||
nt|toral5: i doubt.i m sure he wd ve ruffed with 10.|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@C probably forcing one round|pg||
nt|iceking: what should Nickell bid here 3@H splinter |pg||
nt|iceking: many dont like splinter bids with stiff Ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: 1nT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton down 1400 in 5@Dx...|pg||
nt|blum1956: the club slam is makeable here but neither easy to bid nor to play|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt or 5 clubs s/b no swings here|pg||
nt|barnets: north chose to pass|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bt: i like 1@H in a perverted way|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps at the state of the match he could have gambled|pg||
nt|barnets: he has not picked up enough imps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|reisig: 1N seems "normal|pg||
nt|mamos: oww|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S doesnt  seem ormal|pg||
nt|mamos: normal|pg||
nt|blum1956: the heart slam is clearly down|pg||
nt|stc: yes, you can't discard loosing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N is lebensohlish no doubt|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|bt: you dont want to open 2/3/4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@C i dont know if its keycard asking or just setting asking for que-bids|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe ...they are getting warmed up|pg||
nt|mamos: practising 4-3 fits obviously|pg||
nt|gulyas: just trying to come up with something interesting:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: According to the NS CC, South could have doubled 2@c to show three hearts|pg||
nt|tez: 4441 likes balanced hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42: could still be both|pg||
nt|kittyc: their convention card is here http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010nonJuniorPhiladelphia/Katz-Nickell.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: key cards I think|pg||
nt|iceking: well i still dont know as 4@S could either be resond to ace asking or Que bid hehe|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: perhaps it isnt the boards its the players :)|pg||
nt|vicky888:  now, thts the action table|pg||
nt|bt: but u want to open|pg||
nt|toral5: defence can restrict 3nt to 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|barnets: they have gone down in 2 marginal games|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: typical acol auction here,  11 tricks looks likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: e asking question|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  fine contract and result in OR for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is surely tempting but Cohler cant do more than 4@s|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, if South could have doubled to show 3@h, is his pass alertable? I don't know|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 25 - EW in the other room made 3NT , quite unclear how from the movie, it looked like a sure -1|pg||
nt|toral5: not a gud brd to watch from the kibitzing point of view|pg||
nt|barnets: only 3 boards left but you never know what they might bring|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: north should have a yarborough on the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: n thinking|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bt: he is suprised|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: we thank all the spectators for watching|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzsv: tomorrow we have KO RD16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sementaç  "good clubs, bad spades"|pg||
nt|toral5: last board coming up after this.whn is the 3rd set?|pg||
nt|barnets: would anyone x ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|reisig: We all have different overcall styles|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: 6@c make in dd, but the percentage play is to take the @h hook and go down|pg||
nt|toral5: 1 imp at stake here:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: usually quite soon after|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks as well to WBF and BBO for these amazing oportunities to see the greatest players|pg||
nt|tez: congrats to zimmermann teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: please check the vugraph schedule for tomorrow broadcasts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Helness thinking hard... he does not know it does not matter|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|bg: 5c-3d-1h=9 push next|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 3rd set 55 min from now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzsv: 15:30 local time|pg||
nt|toral5: presumming they attack @S which is quiet obvious or dont duck @H|pg||
nt|bg: good play to continue now makes 4 maybe 5 if Greco does not cash spade Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: one hour|pg||
nt|toral5: thts y i said 1 imp at stake:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: I am told the 3NT score IS wrong so things are better than they look|pg||
nt|kittyc: looks like RKC from the card but not clear|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: you could do, but you'd worry that they might run to three diamonds and you would get a minus instead of a plus|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: thoughtful lead by n, didnt matter here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i lost play sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: i will cliam at the end|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: claim|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1 imp now for lavazza ATLEAST|pg||
pc|c2|nt|reisig: As long as we both on the same page ..it's OK|pg||
nt|isp: 140|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hampton still leading the match (and the group) tho|pg||
nt|tez: boss calling.i must go(wife)..ty all..enjoyed..bye:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|isp: 170 was wrong|pg||
nt|reisig: They are GREAT at claiming|pg||
nt|ritong: needs @d H9 on or KQx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|lml: if you are trying to check the scores on the scoring site, it is full but it usually does come back after a while... link at www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|iceking: been told it was keycard askign|pg||
nt|iceking: asking|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: still cant get on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H by Moss looks an off-the-wall bid to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still i dont think that will be a big swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: sorry...Boyd played A of diamonds|pg||
nt|iceking: not much in this one @S Q is onside and its needed|pg||
nt|kittyc: although the spade hook is on, if he plays to squeeze (HK and SQ in same hand) he goes down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: squeezes for show, finesses for dough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: then played heart and declarer ruffed|pg||
nt|iceking: yes true me might play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe you already won the board, if parter was off-center for his weak two bid and had driven them into a bad contract|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|nt|mamos: Poddar leading this group|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: Fredin in 4th with two strong US teams inbetween|pg||
nt|ritong: not today|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: that is a 17 imp difference .. loss of 10 to win of 7|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW have stolen the hand|pg||
nt|toral5: 11 resulted in 9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: and would put this at 4|pg||
nt|lml: 4 imps difference|pg||

nt|wstuart: no real chance of that though|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if Martel was trying for a mildly swing position by not bidding stayman?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: ginossar asking about nt style|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: peculiar... Stansby and Pachtman are taking a restroom break while Ginossar thinks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: now martel is getting ginossar a glass of water... all in mid-hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: It is generally accepted that if one has to go for a break (especisally during a hand), that one of the opposition will come with you just to prevent any possibility of UI ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: occuring, however, inadvertant.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: that ginossar should p%%% or get off the pot? :)|pg||

nt|petepunt: agree 6@C amy make but tough to reach|pg||
nt|mamos: last hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, perhaps he was trying to disrupt NS's bidding -- but it seems he chose the wrong time |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: did notknow 1st was last|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: last board nowù|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: now|pg||
nt|toral5: last brd now.tnk u all.we did have a nice entertaining set.see u in an hrs.tnk u bruce,caitlin,xenya|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: was concerned clubs were 4-0 on last|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: guessed the spade|pg||
nt|kittyc: good job|pg||
nt|dburn: still, you could also quite reasonably decide that you need to get a penalty here - might be that everything is normal and you need the points|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: "Service Unavailable" -  the web site must be getting a bit of a hammering|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS wont be able to bid this hand   they dont have a 4-3 fit available|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|reisig: I bet - 1N won't end the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H all pass?|pg||
nt|kjadams: that a restricted choice situation?   assuming aggressive lead... might have led spade with Q vs Heart with King?|pg||
nt|tlc: a routine 3NT or 4@H hand is not what Fleisher needs at this point...|pg||
nt|barnets: dont think so|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel chose not to look for a heart fit facing a weak no trump|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think west passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: ns will make 4@H unless ew cash 3@S |pg||
nt|caitlin: ty to our operator Joe and to specs!|pg||
nt|toral5: if @C 4-0 he can always test 1 high @C aftr @H duck,and revert back to @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: :)  thanks commentators and specs|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|reisig: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No way to stop 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW playing precision I assume|pg||
nt|mamos: south pass|pg||
nt|kittyc: yes good point, might well have|pg||
mb|2H|nt|reisig: "cold" game :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s on 26. 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: yes ... the server does do that at the end of the round|pg||
nt|mamos: of this set -- two more stanzas today each of 14 boards   lots of excitement this week|pg||
nt|bessi2: VERY nice bid from Lev given that Cohler would never have defeated 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You just have the entry, @SK, to advance @HJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing a spade, a heart and a diamond|pg||
nt|lml: not surprising really|pg||
nt|lml: I am told that they did make 3NT but the operator input the play incorrectly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petepunt: likely 9 now|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to vugraph op  and to USBF and WBF and BBO|pg||
nt|mamos: great ti see Fred here|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: at least nine tricks |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Nickell apologized for taking so long to play 6C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Lucky game|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now he can play 1NT faster|pg||
nt|kjadams: T shows jack or shortness.    Shortness for them could be 3.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H would have been easier |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: standard carding signals|pg||
nt|bt: after bidding 4@H i think south has a double, though depending on agrrement|pg||
nt|tlc: 2@D being game forcing checkback..|pg||

nt|barnets: thats only 3 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: he can get 2-2 red tricks, and 4@Cs|pg||
nt|mamos: was always struggling even with a favourabl lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bt: ns carding not efficient|pg||
nt|caitlin: suspect Cayne for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|toral5: he will play @D to the king and low @C incase greco has both kj|pg||
nt|caitlin: go to www.e-catsbridge.com   to Philly 2010.......and there is a click here for results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but @CA was a good start|pg||
nt|dburn: and he got 430 for his efforts instead of 420, which would have been a top - fortunately, this is the teams not the pairs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|reisig: For me - @ds would be 4-1 and have to lose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA onside (good chance), West with Kx in hearts and diamonds 3-2|pg||
nt|xenya: operator showed the ideal defence  |pg||
nt|lml: too bad they didnt show it to the players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wish we could do that at the table|pg||

nt|gulyas: will probably draw trumps and settle for 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: right|pg||
nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
nt|barnets: various comments from specs on the last board|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lml: you pretty well have to punt it with the East hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some day <i will learn how to spell..  |pg||
nt|xenya: well, yes -- but still|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, cannot really ruff both @Cs in hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|lml: it was well done|pg||
nt|lml: worth a single pip|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|toral5: no comments if south plays @H:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: anyonedo math here:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: anyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: how many sets a day Joe?|pg||
nt|toral5: we have about 20,800 people on bbo at the moment.thts a huge number|pg||
nt|bg: 4 sets|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 4 X 14 each day|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: allegedly, all no 15 boards have been taken away for repainting the vulnerability marks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: no re-entry to hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|d5|nt|gulyas: can make an extra @D trick tho:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|toral5: guess the set has ended now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no one seems to know why we started with 16 instead of 15|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty folks see you in hour!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: interesting that the open plays 56 bd matches.   the women play 60|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: women are in a later stage of the event so maybe that is why|pg||
nt|caitlin: and I sure hope we get finals of women's on vugraph!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: come back in 35 minutes for more action|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: that's always depressing for a defender - when declarer plays the suit you've led straight back at you|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm sure many believe west should have bid something (or DBLd)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kittyc: thanks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well gotta go now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks all!|pg||
nt|kjadams: hmm.. which black ace did he cash?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: spade, in fact|pg||
nt|kittyc: hmm that was not best for declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: maybe that's why I got it wrong |pg||
nt|kittyc: maybe :)|pg||
nt|kittyc: easy when you can see all the hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Robinson in deep thought now|pg||
nt|barnets: if north knew when to return a club ten a spade is always best|pg||
nt|tlc: i admit to counting myself amongst the passers|pg||
mc|5|nt|barnets: maybe x means something else|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: I believe the only way Fleisher can win the match at thsi point is for both tables to bid a slam here and just EW make it, which *is* possible if they guess everything.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one wont even make the classified ads|pg||
nt|wstuart: but I bet neither side will bid a slam here.|pg||

nt|gulyas: OK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, gave nothing away|pg||
nt|lml: a good result anyway|pg||
nt|barnets: but effectively the match is over|pg||
nt|tlc: a hard fought match..and congratulations to the Wolfon team and good luck tomorrow|pg||
mb|1C|nt|barnets: and wolfson has prevailed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|reisig: 1@s or 2@s?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't like W's pass, even though it might turn successful here if E finds a X|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure I would have passed the West hand|pg||
nt|lml: yes we agree :)|pg||
nt|kittyc: it is refreshing to see bad balanced 11 counts being passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: 2@S|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@c coming|pg||
nt|mamos: richie dont go to casino|pg||
nt|stc: Low scoring match with two compensating swings coming from the weak NT|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT makes via a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: bad 4 @d's and 4-3-3-3 , the optimal for a double is when you're short in Partner's suit and have at least 5 of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: for leaving a double, that is|pg||
nt|barnets: a great performance by a brand new team|pg||
mb|3N|nt|reisig: I go ...either way|pg||
nt|reisig: Now ..that's a heavy 2@s|pg||
nt|lml: how to get caught up|pg||
nt|xenya: they will land on their feet though|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3H walking the dog perhaps.|pg||
nt|kittyc: how many diamonfs will north bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: I thought it was over anyway, but they seem to have found a fifteenth board|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 3@S a nice bid by West - maybe a bit of a D/D fantasy though|pg||
nt|kittyc: surprised East passed, looks like all his cards are working|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: long thought by Nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: long, long thought|pg||
nt|kjadams: with lucky clubs, 5H is makeable.   Seems like pard must fit the clubs on this auction.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, they might as well not have bothered|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: 3@S now|pg||
nt|barnets: there will be 4 great teams in the semi finals|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blum1956: Pszczola carefully avoids bidding with @dKx and a void in partner's suit|pg||
nt|stc: smart :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, East's hand just got worse thoughout|pg||
nt|lml: but to normal|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|reisig: I better stop predicting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 29 flat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this should make nine easily enough|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: the 10 is a nice card for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: duck the first @d is best for def. then S has some difficulties of discards over 4 @s's|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: well bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if he makes it|pg||
nt|gulyas: fun fact from my ppl again:):|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: bapat asked he could have 4S, DZ 1000 to 1 against it.|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 28, where 3nt was down 2 here|pg||
nt|gulyas: both rooms in 3NT, Dumbovich making...|pg||
nt|gulyas: doubled in the other, down 1 on the requested @S lead! the match tied|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the @Cs right, he can ruff some @Hs, but he has communication problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 10 is 0 or 2 higher|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: even though it looks like declarer is safe for 9 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|lml: if South ducks the heart finesse is 9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: which is quite safe -- even with the @HK in the N hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: 3 usa teams and one european|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|gulyas: interesting enough, 3NT can be made, with @Cs taking 4 tricks, 2 red aces, and @Ss also giving you 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: lots of thinking going on|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets take stock|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|gulyas: @HA+2ruffs, @DA+ruff, 2 top @Cs|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|reisig: Defense ...defense|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: West is suddenly hoping the heart king is onside|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: pretty safe to duck|pg||
nt|lml: now the heart finesse can lose|pg||
nt|lml: or win|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, a club lead now and he can duck again|pg||
nt|lml: he could|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, good play |pg||
nt|lml: would be okay|pg||
nt|lml: then ninth trick in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it is dead silent in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and very still...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no kibbitzers are allowed in the viewgraph room.  <just me and the players here. |pg||
nt|lml: I would just want the match to be over so I could have an adult beverage|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mamos: well 2 @H ruffs gone|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs only 3 more trump tricks -not gonna happen|pg||
nt|gulyas: now ruff a @H, and play on @Cs|pg||
nt|mamos: seems likely to play Diamonds now|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will lose a @D and a trump from now|pg||
nt|gulyas: *@H and trump, sorry|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as @Cs behave, he is fine|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know whaat they play in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 25 min. warning|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Hungarian declarer made this one:)...|pg||
nt|gulyas: same contract in OR I hear|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|barnets: Wolfson of course has one israeli pair|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzsv: I dont know, Im not there. |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: he is going for it|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets: thanks to all specs for your comments and to the wbf and of course bridge base|pg||
