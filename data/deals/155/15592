nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
pc|c5|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jkotor: i think he is winning in the different boards|pg||
nt|pelu: carefull unblocing @DA|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time now|pg||
nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|swanson: Would the 9 or 10 be led for 10-9 doubleton, Jakub?|pg||
nt|algraves: yes Meckstroths opener seems to have fooled him a little|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|swanson: from|pg||
nt|jkotor: 10 is 109 for 98% of Polish|pg||
nt|jkotor: but 2 from 92|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm sure he was confident that meck had the heart K for his opening bid...|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|h2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphztb: suit preference plays by N S are standard|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: the first bid suit has not been touched yet...|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: :(|pg||
nt|panja: no problems, that card isn't very relevant|pg||
nt|migry: don't worry:)|pg||
nt|toral5: hello everyone|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|migry: Hi - welcome|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: the scores v see so close is the courtesy of zia-hamman on the last brd of 1st set|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: trumps at last..|pg||
mc|8|nt|migry: they bid and made a slam missing 2 key cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cc for all of Nickell team are online from the 2010 USBF Trials  under  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|toral5: had zia made 6@H on brd 14,scores wd have been totally different|pg||
nt|migry: and dropped K singleton offside|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-SÃ¦lensminde|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|hearts|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@c denies|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell Pachtman discussing system the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|yuval10: 2@d is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL someone was complaining to me yesterday about the transfer responses - I had to explain that they are almost standard in some quarters of the expert community\|pg||
nt|yuval10: says nothing about @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: @d sry|pg||
mb|2H|an|2|nt|vugraphzta: both sides of the screen writting explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
mb|4H|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: 2h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|toral5: nice 2nd dbl from helgemo|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT played the other way up, likely to make |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||
nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice support dummy has|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
nt|algraves: well so he can try and ruff a spade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rmb1: It very easy to look at all the hand and say what declarer has to do :)|pg||
nt|ady: now club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rmb1: Defence have to switch and switch again|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|toral5: he will lead a @D frm hand after taking @S pitch|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|swanson: And this is now down two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta:  it is too fast :(|pg||
nt|jkotor: unless he takes 3 tricks :)|pg||
nt|algraves: but will only make 5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: The defense might have cashed out for down two.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell says that if south doubled the 2 @H bid, your pd would not be thrilled|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|migry: 3@c = invitational with clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|toral5: actually he dint bid.hamman bid 6@C which forced zia to correct to 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: bids are not made until the board is passed underneath the screen so that the players cannot hear the clicking of the mouse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: invitational with Club suit? is that right?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|migry: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: P-1@H//2@C would have been Drury|pg||
mb|3S|nt|toral5: do they play 3/1 as nat inv in passed hands also?|pg||
nt|panja: well, in that case they will find it difficult to bid the game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|panja: did 3@h show better than minimum?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|toral5: nickell will have an easy claim time here|pg||
nt|migry: i guess it's the only way to show a natural club suit as 2@c would be drury|pg||
nt|panja: Ala, what did 3@H show?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Nickell says they play standard signals and Katz says they will have to readjust and the players laugh|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 2 imps for HH|pg||
mb|1N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|jkotor: but what is 1 trick between the true friends !|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs some more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good NS result next door|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT    on for n/s  as they lay|pg||
nt|tlc: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will play in 3NT of course|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|algraves: and the hand lies relatively well for declarer so he will make it easily enough|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
mb|3N|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East in the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/israel/ronpa-gino.pdf  for E-W's convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably knows i said the table is flying|pg||
nt|figo: great|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 1 imp match at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east stil in the tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asked for the screen to come down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: having a drink now....does not look in a hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: You don't know if N-S have a fit|pg||
nt|toral5: yes and almost as gud as 0-3/4 hcps|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C better than 5@D as 2nd spade ruff with 10@C holds|pg||
nt|rmb1: This has play, take two ruffs and draw trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|algraves: i mean the opps have 27 - 29 hcp , everything is breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: McConnell = women's event|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|algraves: now meckstroth wants to play the next club from hand in case west has K9x|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|swanson: Pass is possible because 1@C is forcing, but that is far from a guarantee that North will find it easier to describe his hand later.|pg||
nt|ady: needs care|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|toral5: thank god strul doesnt have a trump now:)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|algraves: hmm. declarer has certainly gotten deeply into this hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Pop up squeeze in preparation perhaps.  |pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: They will let the men play 16 boards per set in the final tomorrow|pg||
nt|algraves: he was worried about qT8x with east|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|panja: ok, so 3@D would have been minimum perhaps...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|migry: maybe pass would show a minimum|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|nt|toral5: we are having a very flat session til now,this brd no exception|pg||

nt|jkotor: just have to jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: now 3@h - 3NT?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some might have passed with Zia's hand - Hamman will smile|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think North will stop below game whatever South does|pg||
nt|swanson: How big can his smile be, though?|pg||
nt|jkotor: "i d like, but i m affraid"|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: simple straight bidding in the other room cos north passed|pg||

nt|yuval10: big result to Wolfson in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are thinking for 10 mins and then they arte throwing the cards on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT forces 3@C, unless doubler is strong, then he ignores the transfer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jkotor: seems like second transfer|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@H is a retransfer.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: cards stil on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand|pg||
nt|toral5: helness thinking of a possibility of trump promotion|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: But he ended up playing for @CJ with West (or guessing to drop @CJx with East)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|toral5: incase helgemo raised with aq|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: hand shown|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then I am not sure you qualify as our operator :)|pg||
nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||
nt|kareno: played for solutions.  And he was serious!!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tlc: will be surprised if the @C queen isnt played as well|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves: so his sequence of cards suggests 6 to QJ98|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzta: Helness said TOUGH TO BEAT and all laughed|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|pc|sT|nt|rmb1: I know @C6 is an entry but he has to knock out @CJ and @SA first,|pg||
nt|algraves: so rodwell has no losing play and declarer should claim 3|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: I think East had to play @H when in with @CJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c8|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|panja: rather thin 2@C overcall...|pg||
nt|panja: could have landed NS in trouble|pg||
nt|toral5: 2@S dbl was 800:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|migry: not that dangerous opposite a passed hand partner - rates to create more problems for the opponents than for your side|pg||
nt|toral5: NOT many will like this 2@C oc|pg||
nt|panja: after @SA and ruff, this will come to @D guess...|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|panja: just like the @C situation on the last deal|pg||
nt|panja: either of NS could have @DHx...E will have to guess right to make..|pg||
nt|toral5: @D will be easy to gues cos 8 and 9 both are missing|pg||
nt|toral5: if 6@C,3@H stiff @S known,he can work out|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the Rosenblum and McConnell teams are playing the same boards, ostensibly at the same time, but the Rosenblum Teams play 15 boards a session and the McConnell 16 boards :)|pg||
nt|panja: as the cards are E needs to run @DJ or T first time, if S held !K9 doubleton, say, he would have had to play small from E hand first|pg||
nt|toral5: why?did south overcall with JUST 5@C?6 or more @C are marked,whn stiff @S is known along with 3@H,he is destined to guess @D|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz is deep in thought|pg||
nt|panja: the guess is not as easy as it seems on first impression...with the poor hand that S has, he could well have 7 Clubs to justify an overcall...and hence only two Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: why 7c?play @C ace and ruff @C.hand is counted|pg||
pc|cK|nt|migry: probably east was afraid of club taps in the 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one possible factor for 2@C bid -- it takes away West chance to bid 1N or Drury |pg||
nt|toral5: now they r in the worst contract,ONLY revoke allows it to make|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: do HH play 2@H here as natural or @S raise?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT rebid suggesting more than an opening NT, 18-19|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|swanson: That was a big blow - 4@S is far from certain to be bid even if North opens 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia writes a maximum with 3 spades|pg||
nt|jkotor: Max, with HHx@s?|pg||
nt|algraves: now Pachtman has a decision about wether to re open|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@H would be a good spade raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Redouble is 9+ hcp|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Helness said aha nice |pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  aggressive   partner balancing|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not the South is interested|pg||
nt|yuval10: X over NT for EW means @s and suit, as we learned yesterday, and W would never dream of bidding it with such a horrible suits|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky Rodwell \:)|pg||
nt|algraves: best defense is 500 against 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Pachtman thinking THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM US|pg||
nt|algraves: but west may remove double to 2!|pg||
nt|algraves: 2@S |pg||
nt|tlc: same auction to this point in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: anyone balance out there with double?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves: nope discretion the better part of valour|pg||
nt|tlc: at MPs maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously Rodwell intended to pass any response but this is the one he really hoped to hear I would guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson: 2NT probably shows a maximum spade hand with two honor and three cards in spades.|pg||
nt|toral5: should he hook @H here?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: right on Karen|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|jkotor: why 3@h now if anyway 3nt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you have to say, this is a bit of a silly contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: needs to guess the red finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: noone can explain what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, North has implied majors too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rodwell could have been 4450, no reason to re-open|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell went to the bathroom|pg||
pc|d5|nt|algraves: well sometimes they are in big trouble and you have more high cards than they do. so you might get a penalty or a partscore swing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: request for link to video please|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson: This sequence would seem to offer a choice of games with emphasis on spades (rather than a direct 3NT over 2NT).|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess down the middle is to pass it out|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: the North hand isn't strong enough for 3N=slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia is impassive|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has to guess which red suit finesse to take.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|jkotor: friend is telling me J@h, if no K, then kill it take @s, and finesse @d|pg||
nt|odysseus69: jack of hearts to test was usual Zia style - if no king then play diamond finesse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|toral5: that can be costly if @H q off.|pg||
nt|toral5: presuming defence wont allow @D ruff,helness does have a problm here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 20  Ginossar 3N West, @S lead   ---  there's another reason for 2@C overcall in our room either keeps EW out of 3N or helps North lead|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: on the surface e-w cards look good for 4 hearts - but the 4-1 trump break means curtains - kind of game everyone is bidding|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes I guess it is possible to misquess diamonds if west plays low and you put in ten|pg||
nt|kareno: Only way I can see making only five is with Ace and a diamond led.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 probably the right card though|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: east thinking some more|pg||

pc|h7|nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play again, but Zia says nasty, nasty|pg||
nt|jkotor: easy -1 now, everything clear|pg||
nt|swanson: Zia needs both club honors (3-3) to his left - with than assumption the @SK is almost certainly offside.|pg||

mb|1H|an|alerted|nt|jkotor: what is your call after 1@h from E?|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see how many @d's will E bid|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, his partnership has little think time to spare :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jkotor: I m also for X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h = 5+@s or 11-13 bal, game force|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||
mb|p|an|alert|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din Ã¥bningshÃ¥nd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make |pg||
nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|migry: you don't want to defend with 7-5 |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz is writing about his pass of 4 @D bid, but he did not appear to alert it.|pg||
nt|migry: maybe 5@s by south now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've confirmed  Willenken DID have option to show 3@S via 2@D-DBL|pg||
nt|migry: who hasn't shown any spade support/extras|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Players alert their bids by pointing to them, as a rule|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth starts South hand with Precision 1@C     standby |pg||
nt|panja: is there much rationale to any action here?|pg||
nt|migry: i can understand south's pass over 2@d - on a different hand that would have been the right thing to do - here, it made life more difficult in exploring for the grand and i don't ...|pg||
nt|migry: think North can guess|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rosenberg is staring at his pd's 6 @S bid, trying to figure it out exactly.  His vision does not waver.|pg||
nt|toral5: obviously rosenberg is NOT giving @D ace to south.6@D was available with him |pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction uncertain because of assumption that Chris has less than 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: perhaps the confusion about the diamond ace lies with Katz's ss of 4 @D?|pg||
nt|toral5: and ofcrs NO @H king also|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: meckwell bid the grand|pg||

mb|p|nt|toral5: may be a namyat 4@C would have shut out north from entering|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||

nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh for the comparisons.  So we have two to go.|pg||
nt|algraves: this is a bad hand type for precision so meckstroth upgrades to a club rather than open a diamond|pg||

nt|pelu: @c6|pg||
nt|kittyc: in oher rooms south showed both suits (eg if East bids 2S then South can bid 3D)|pg||
nt|bt: thats to make 5 isnt it|pg||
nt|kareno: 64 is a better number of boards to include all the dealer and vulnerability possibilities|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl T/O|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: around 30 hcp for e/w   but not fitting to well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: yes, 4 is cold|pg||
nt|rmb1: tomorrow for the semifinals ... that's today for those us in Europe (00:53 am)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: usually showing a maximum 1@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree Karen seems silly of WBF to play only 60 boards|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|kareno: In the ACBL we have seen the numbers of boards degraded so swiss matches are now only 6, not a good thing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: from tom we have 16 i think|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is one down at least|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: can be no great swing in for this hand    so Woolfson should be through  17 imps ahead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think East thinks that an overtrick or two here is going to win the match |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well he is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C would have made undoubtedly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i mean tomorrow we will have 16...last day|pg||
nt|kareno: But session fees have gone UP to compensate for fewer boards :(|pg||
nt|algraves: so east is playing with the houses money as they say|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry that for 11 tricks - but still a nice finess: @c5 , @c6, @c8 to setup @c4!|pg||
