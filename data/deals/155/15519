nt|vugraphzsu: ew won 3 tricks.  K10 was lead by E|pg||

nt|bobh1: hi linda|pg||
nt|bobh1: april|pg||
nt|lml: The Rayner team are all friends from Canada so it will be interesting to see how they meet this challenge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|lml: All of these players have done very well over the years in Canadian team trials|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a dull 3N to start with|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|oliverc: yes, horrible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Marshall!!!  welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lml: I think I would bid 2@H now with the North hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: an exciting deal to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hi|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi April:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|mamos: all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: welcome to this round of 64 match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: hi April|pg||
nt|bobh1: sementa is not done|pg||
nt|lml: no but I think North should be|pg||
nt|lml: the points are very soft and he has shown about this much|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a lot of cards altho they may not be useful ones|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: quick note, I can only see one side of the table when screens are down so bids will be delayed until the board comes back.|pg||
nt|lml: thanks :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N will bid again because its imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: hargreaves sementa|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby play a weak NT except 3rd seat VUL   but rarely open 1N with this shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: @H@H@H@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcphee: E did well to resist the temptation to o/c 2@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: surprised to see this|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: well Sementa has to figure that his partner couldn't even bid 2@D in the first place|pg||
nt|lml: and he only gave preference.  He can't have anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I dont have that yet. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mcphee: as often happens in these cases when partner is broke, the 2 level is way too high|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: a fairly quiet start while we all get settled down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|lml: this contract is very tight.  |pg||
nt|lml: it might make if east can be enplayed somehow|pg||
nt|lml: cash the @HQ and lead a spade?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|oliverc: now ok|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: 9 cl droping makes the contract safe|pg||

nt|corplaw: partscore battle probably to be won by EW in spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tlc: a multi 2@D..showing weak hand w/ length in a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p!|mb|2S|nt|tlc: this is going to make it difficult for N-S to enter the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: 2@H being pass/correct, which eadst does|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|tlc: 2@S was a pleasant surprise to West, who now makes another game try (not sure about the method)..|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Peter Crouch from England|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi all|pg||
nt|corplaw: interesting that E showed diamond feature with min weak 2, getting e-W too high|pg||
nt|tlc: hi peter..welcome|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ty|pg||
nt|tlc: yes...whatever their methods...any peep of encouragement seems overly optimistic|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: W mentioned about England and about the Scotland.  The flag outside the door is wrong and confusing anyway,|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|Walddk1: Well, to be honest, neither is English|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Sandqvist is from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||

nt|oliverc: good 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|lml: at the moment I see that Lavassa is the leader and Rayner is not too far behind|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: these guys are fast players.. <i will try to keep up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: west in the oR responded 2@C and went onto 3@C which looks over optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztf: players took this board upside down :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC for EW from 2010 European Championship online at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/sweden/nystrom-bertheau.pdf|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oliverc: I really dislike the 4@D bid at the other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: N bid a fast 4@D and that ended the party for 3N|pg||
nt|lml: well 11 VP/// Rayner is 4th with 87 and Lavazza has 98|pg||
nt|lml: good morning |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: silly to bypass 3NT when partner has opened|pg||
nt|riccho: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi April.  Good to work with you again|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karen Allison|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: true but how can u ask partner if he stops the rest suits to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: here with partner a passed hand the pre-empt has appeal|pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive opening here from Martel|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what methods East-West use, but these are likely to get them to a hopeless game fairly quickly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oliverc: unbelievable|pg||
nt|tlc: hi everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you can see   2@C neither promises a 4-card major  nor  points :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in days of yore when one picked up a hand like N has one could expect to open the bidding. nowadays one is lucky to be able to open if one holds it in second seat. 4th chair? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fuhgedaboutit|pg||
nt|mamos: ndo???|pg||
nt|mamos: undo|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas ... Roland :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello Karen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: same auction in both rooms|pg||
nt|tlc: may i join the fun?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jim -- you want to psyche or DBL???|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobh1: sementa is rather distributional for a negative double|pg||
nt|lml: With a vulnerable game it is hard for South to resist although you might say he already bid his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobh1: and 3@h seems insufficient to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: the K @s is suspect but you never know|pg||
nt|riccho: IÂ´m not able to imagine an american pair playing sth different from WK2 opening|pg||
nt|dburn: however, hopeless is as hopeless does - if declarer plays a secodn trump, South needs to cash out|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Is this the real auction?|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction is out of sync but I think we can see what is happening  1@h from South f 1NT from North|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT I guess coming|pg||
nt|kareno: I get it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And it's an easy 3nt.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: when I played 10-12 NT  i would try 2N as West -- but that was natural invite back then|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: and not do anything heroic like underleading @hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tlc: seems on this auction that stansby might try 3nt w/ many more HCP than he might have|pg||
pc|d3|nt|riccho: but with the red aces this shouldnt be a big problem|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: everyone is asking me about the running scores... go to www.bridgeblogging.com and click on the link|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think this will work out well for Auken though|pg||
nt|lml: bidding the same hand twice is likely to get you in trouble.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: The good news is that he is not doubled, the bad news is he is vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: asking about leads and carding, but I cant hear the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: i guess he will make only 3 the way he's playing it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|kareno: If clubs can be only 3 long, that is a quirky bid.  I don't know their system, however.|pg||
nt|mamos: so for ayone confused by the auction we think South opened 1@H North responded 1NT and South bid 2@C  Im not sure why North thought 5@C was right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: Lauria could have doubled.  Doubling games is not as risky and can be quite profitable|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: some specs are already asking for the link to the running standings.  please publish if you have it.  thanks!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|lml: 98 is a huge score|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that....however, he might transfer and bid 3N, though action is doubtful, since that would at least give him two ways to win|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: I dont know. a spade back and a club|pg||
nt|lml: ruff ruff and a trump trick|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: You can go to either www.bridgeblogging.com and push the button at the top or go to www.bridgwinners.com|pg||
mc|9|nt|tlc: agreed..aassuming they have that agreement on this auction(probably yes)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stansby understandably went low because they probably intervene aggressively against these EW methods|pg||
pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|tlc: Dbl, followed by 3@S to show the 3 card limit raise...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|corplaw: neg X will get S excited|pg||
nt|tlc: that is true...which he is|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  might double 4@s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nik is usually keen to pull the trigger |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The closed room does not make a lot of sense. N-S stopped in 2@S and moments later they were in game|pg||
nt|Walddk1: *auction|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  in e-w partnership nik is the pitcher and tosh the catcher|pg||
nt|tlc: u nailed that one peter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: He knows them too well|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Did Nick double you frequently, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  when nik is on a roll it can be very difficult as their opponent|pg||
nt|pitiful:  usually good tactics to double me|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: the closed room north decided to make a heavy 2@S raise and then when his partner introduced hi KQ@H, he bid game..which unfortunately was too high|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not sure where the redouble has come from|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps a bit of table ownership|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||

nt|mamos: it seemed that North had little idea what South's shape was so East was a little unlikely to know either|pg||
nt|dburn: duly accomplished in jig time - having spent this afternoon watching Weichsel, Feldman, Sadek and El-Almahdy, I must say that it is refershing to see bridge being played at normal ...|pg||
nt|dburn: tempo|pg||
nt|riccho: rofl|pg||
mb|1S|nt|riccho: the only advantage is than, that you get the results from the other table|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one way or another board 2 will be a swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S, usually not 10 HCP & 5332|pg||
nt|dburn: four-card majors, strong no trump, nothing much else special for North-South|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: to have any shot of reaching 3N it seems you just need to try 2@D or 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: is S hand a clear opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Nystrom-Bertheau  almost all hands with 16+ HCP start with 1@C [some 16 have options]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned double from N...some would bid 2H as that is the most likely place for game. but here Martel is not willing to bid 2H then back in with douyble, so he preferes to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: show the polyvalent nature of the hand immediately|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcphee: not for me|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think biddable|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has a huge hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner opened the bidding and then raised his suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: sementa thought he should have worked it, I think. but I do not speak Italian.|pg||
nt|lml: if you following along this match is in GROUP C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if any other vugraph session has seen/heard the use of 'polyvalent'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: sounds very chemical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: vocabulary quiz at end of set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S torn between H and NT, H will win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Martel's action was a Forcing Pass situation -- where 2@H weaker than PASS then bid|pg||
nt|kareno: That double announces a penalty pass over 1@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: Shenkin is not happy his partner passed his jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i am very much against opening marginal minor suited hands|pg||
nt|bobh1: and then accepted his game try|pg||
nt|lml: I never do that no matter how bad my hand.  I am too little to take the abuse|pg||
nt|mamos: that 1@S overcall was not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|kareno: No but if you don't get your suits into the auction, you can be run over on the partscore hands.|pg||
nt|mamos: the danger on this hand seems to be of settling in 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|riccho: X|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I like cue bidding when I accept with the South hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps should have cue-bid @cs instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is probably kickback?|pg||
nt|lml: south has a very good hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to guess since 1N was artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, torn between raising hearts and trying for NT via 2S|pg||
nt|tlc: this time the conservative view will not pay off..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and who can blame him?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: swing here|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to out bid the majors holding minors|pg||
nt|lml: can north count 13 tricks using Blackwood?  Probably not|pg||
nt|lml: he needs some more information... the stiff spade is key|pg||
pc|c2|nt|riccho: I have to admit I would have doubled this|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: And you've exactly identified what was about to happen.  @h Q to beat it.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: well then again just bidding it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has a reasonable X, for sure|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|lml: he didnt even take him back to diamonds his first suit.  This is very naughty because Shenkin does always have even four clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are playing way to fast for me to keep up.  Shenkin not happy about pard passing forceing bid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has every reason to think that the black suit strengths of the defense are massed behind those of the offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin opened Stansby's hand so they had relatively free run to 4@H  again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and it is a NV game|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcphee: here I think the 2@D call is too much from W|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|mamos: The Cayne team have started strongly |pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: South needs Kx of diamonds in the pocket and it isn't happening.  He may play diamond to the ace (expecting spade ace in west) just in case of singleton in east.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|lml: this wont take long|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 1 @H response is usually less than  8 hcp|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Whichever, he is going down for the count.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jkotor: especially when S has A@s...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|kareno: Nice pickup for the Cayne team for being in the best contract.  Belgium hovering on the brink with the last hand and now this one.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|dburn: even so, when the opponents have an "impossible" auction - they were prepared to play 2@s a round of bidding ago - you might double them in four|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|riccho: true|pg||

mb|p|nt|tlc: right you area gain!|pg||
nt|tlc: again|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2N shows a maximum with only 3@s i think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i seem to remember that from a previous encounter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Strange that they don't play re-transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: the lack of controls, shape or any other redeeming values should cause this to end in 3@S tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  maybe they do but Tosh wants to declare|pg||
nt|Walddk1: To protect all his tenaces? :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: looks like straightforward make|pg||

nt|lml: yes something lingering with oil is the usual punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where our NS in partscore and other table game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and he thinks it will be an 8 card fit. having said all that, LKosing Trick Count still says "stop thinking and bid a game already"|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a good score for Cayne in the OR  - not so easy to avoid this outcome I think|pg||
nt|dburn: not that Janet de Botton was expecting to be in game - she was catering for a better part score if partner happened to have three spades and four hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: W has only 3 card support opposite a poor hand and what could be a 4 card suit|pg||

nt|lml: So far it seems like the Auken team is trying too hard|pg||
nt|lml: guys just sit back and bid your cards... you are good enough|pg||
nt|riccho: yes careful bidding but partner ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it turns out that the first two recorded scores are played in 6|pg||
nt|mamos: Polish Club|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but with 3 prime cards, north's optimism had a solid basis|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzsv: 1nt not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: This match is between the leaders of this group.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd time in a row  their NS went down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: 1@d negative |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: another potential gain for Zaleski here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: would you have overcalled 1@S with the north hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: up to 14 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: I think I might have|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: only if they bid the slam:)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6d are very gd spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: not easy to avoid it, IMHO|pg||
nt|mathat: 7 @d |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: Rehi all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that - I was trying to get caps lock off and got disconnected|pg||
nt|riccho: obv. no nonforcing stayman here available, so stansby had to trf in his longest suit and hope for the best|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|panosk: even beter|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzsv: Just FYI < I can only see one side of the screen.  So bids by N & E are delayed until the board comes back.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect we'll finally see same contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, alerts are only from the W S discussions|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
nt|panosk: they ll stop at 6 i think lets see if he makes 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got too much to never do anything|pg||
nt|lml: After making a grand he was just worn out|pg||
mc|9|nt|mamos: maybe coffee or drink of choice time|pg||

nt|Walddk1: @DK ducked, diamond won, club to the queen??|pg||
nt|tlc: even after club to the Q, can still make i thk|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Even after cashing the acxe, he has another entry for the heart play as long as clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk1: So must be best to cash the ace first|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 7 tricks are avaialable for North. as long as he leads a heart early|pg||

nt|Walddk1: If he remembers to unblock the 8|pg||

nt|lml: so passing throughout was worth 5 imp|pg||
nt|lml: North is really on a roll here|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think he will do that on this hand|pg||
nt|lml: so he was hoping to endplay Versace but he did not have the communictions to do it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I can see the hands on BBO, but the screens block my view of NN &E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 4 from each group advance to KO    our match is from Group F  where current standings   1) Fleisher 187  2) Italian Stallions 181  3) Fredin 152  4) Chile 150   5th is distant ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 137|pg||
nt|riccho: great play :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: looks like Multi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|riccho: GER - TUR 2:0 :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: many W's would bid 2@s...i think 1@s is fine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C not 100% game force|pg||
nt|dburn: how many victory points is that?|pg||
nt|lml: I love watching Martel and Stansby, one of my favorite pairs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|riccho: I know that nobody is interested in that, but its an exciting game ... :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Anyone for X from East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: might get too high?|pg||
nt|mcphee: an upgrade?|pg||
nt|tlc: now..do you bid 3nt or game in spades now?|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d Multi.  4@h pass or correct.|pg||
nt|mamos: South has a big hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: He has an easy lead...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: slight 1 :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be costly if N searchs for the slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: cannot pass 1@d with a stiff so i also agree with 2@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@d|pg||
nt|lml: 3@d now you think?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N  but with little conviction|pg||
nt|tlc: me too|pg||
pc|dK|nt|riccho: me! maybe E X cards vanished? |pg||
nt|dburn: so he does, but why would anyone double?|pg||
nt|riccho: no no double here really :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Another cup of tea for this hand :)|pg||
nt|mamos: lol you drink faster than me  :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, my X says I have a good hand for my rprevious bidding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: there are hands where everything is right for declarer    then there is this hand|pg||
nt|tlc: it has the added advntage that 4S is likely to fail..and apparently does|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobh1: W might pass this|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mathat: 6 now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 12 on a @C lead, though|pg||
nt|mcphee: Naturally now he should have with this lead|pg||
nt|lml: you have all noticed that Lauria discarded in a way that Van Cleeff could have recovered by throwing him in|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: why does it fail?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a make to me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: I am with David .. pass and lead diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobh1: remarkable restraint by Sementa but as a passed hand he refrained from hanging partner|pg||
nt|lml: it was the right lead to hold this hand tight I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|lml: maybe not... he doesnt really need the ruff does he|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose he could bid 2@d and claim 100 honours even if he didn't make it, but...|pg||
nt|riccho: very reasonable not to double here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tlc: 3n yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: he was probably hoping to set up a @h winner in pd's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   all wrong for 4@S so 3N better   i guess i forgot to type that part|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am talking about 4S, it looks like an easy make|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tlc: u are right..heart pitch on club..my bad|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  i missed that too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: the @D8 was a strong signal for the ruff though|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: Cayne did make it... |pg||
nt|lml: Balicki played it as I would have|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|riccho: at the other table: where doubling 4@s (bd 3) was an option, the other E did so and got an XX - 1|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk1: 6@D anyone?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Fine contract|pg||
nt|pitiful:  my guess is 5@c|pg||
nt|tlc: 2@S really gives North a problem...do you bid 2NT, 3@H or DBL...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  place your money....|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|tlc: 2NT will get u to game in a hurry, but the other choices make things much harder|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tlc: lebensohl hear helps..as 3@C shows values..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Yes, but the diamond is lost I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 3@s-3N now|pg||
nt|Walddk1: diamond fit|pg||
nt|tlc: now 3@S should ask for a stopper |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tlc: or be a cue bid for hearts, which would be clarified next time around|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  wrong again|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Can anyone suggest a route to 6@D?|pg||
nt|tlc: well.. thre are just enough tricks, even w/ the bad club break..since the @D hook is on|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pitiful:  North 2N, south 3@s minors?|pg||
nt|corplaw: maybe entry problems in 6D|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No, ruff a heart|pg||
nt|tlc: but now with the bad club break you cant set up clubs and get back to them|pg||
nt|corplaw: need entry for diamond finesse, entry to get back to set up clubs and entry to cash clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Anyway, no-one has bid 6@D so far|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks tough to make 6@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  interesting lead by nik|pg||
nt|Walddk1: On this lead one would think declarer can play this pretty quickly|pg||
nt|corplaw: 2 imps to fleisher on lead|pg||
nt|tlc: yes..making 5-odd now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|mc|12|nt|corplaw: where did 12th trick come from?|pg||

nt|mcphee: helped by the E player who opened 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: This is the last board I will keep the table open until ofiicial results published|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: tommorow we start at 10:00|pg||
nt|lml: he played spades at trick two|pg||
nt|lml: or three or whatever|pg||
mb|1S|nt|itsgrim: another possible swing in for croatia here.  4 spades looks biddable and like it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: last bord, next round 15:45|pg||
nt|lml: you see if you were playing this at your club everybody would have been that 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3N bid quickly when Bathhurst opened Martel hand 1N|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@s WK2 anyone? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: no|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: played by North not best, but still shouldn't be any problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west passed?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h This and Last board to the end of the Teams Event and All the Greek Islands Fantoni Festival@h@h We thank BBO and Roland especially for giving us the chance to ...|pg||
nt|tlc: with probable uptrick on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right again Jim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because West never got chance to bid|pg||
nt|tlc: actually on the right=meter that's only 1 of 2 :)|pg||
nt|mamos: some form of two suited opening|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@d best contract for n/s but 3nt could beckon again.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: C writing explanation for B; D just said it quietly for Z|pg||
nt|lml: so many reasons for no|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: here duboin thinks his hand is too good for a weak jump shift even after his partner passed|pg||
nt|dburn: would not mind it if playing a method where 2@d was a bad weak two, and 2@s constructive|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: LTC says N does not have a raise to the 3 level, but it is hard to resist with those trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: i think they will bid Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: surely 3N?|pg||
nt|lml: excdept for the four card heart suit... it always burns me|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you play that way, you can often show 6-4 in the majors in response to an inquiry|pg||
nt|lml: headed for 3NT I suppose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: Thanks everyone. I have to go|pg||
nt|mcphee: cheers Oliver|pg||
nt|itsgrim: not sure what no-trump range north-south are playing, but i presume not 15-17u otherwise that's a very aggressive piece of upgrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think 2@S would be fine but I dont mind 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they play drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|itsgrim: but it seems to have excited north, so maybe it was|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsk: looks like we have winner, congrat Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be interesting to find out if Martel was going to invite over 1@S-P|pg||
nt|mamos: ther eshould not be a danger of overbidding here with two Black Aces missing  but you never know ..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @d better|pg||
nt|riccho: 2@c is a very aggressive intervention. But as u c N advancing, he is expecting that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzsv: 3\5 leads|pg||
nt|bobh1: not that S would necessarily sit for 3N but i think N should have bid it|pg||
nt|lml: with the diamonds playing so nicely and hearts with no losers I think 4@H is fine|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobh1: turns out that 4@h is a better contract|pg||
nt|lml: a spade is a good lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Ax is not such a great stopper|pg||
pc|s8|nt|itsgrim: 4 spades by south presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: 1 NT =14-16|pg||
nt|itsgrim: looks like an easy make, losing 1 diamond and 2 hearts.  or +1 if south discards a heart on clubs and guesses the hearts successfully|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: helpful lead as it happens|pg||
nt|panosk: it seems we have a clear winner here|pg||
nt|panosk: gd performance by |pg||
nt|marlowepi: al;most surely he would bid 2S over pass, especially NV|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed..and i think almost everyone would bid 3S in the actual auction...too dangerous to withhold support and values|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|panosk: Zaleski team and congratulations|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done in both rooms!|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: W loved the opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: count cards lead from 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally it would mean H king likely to be onside|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|lml: ace and another would have worked better as it turns out|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: it will be good enough today|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cA|nt|mamos: next|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|lml: South is a bit worried about the heart break|pg||
nt|dburn: not really, but 3NT is not such a bad contract - still, I guess North was considering 3@d, and might have bid it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: 3Nt will make for the same reason 6@D makes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: he needs a club ruff but he also wants to cash the @SK|pg||
nt|lml: hard to handle all the entries|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|corplaw: only AD lead will stop overtrick|pg||
nt|tlc: seems right with a source of tricks on the side|pg||

nt|tlc: for declarer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe north might have considered 6N|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a good spot single dummy|pg||

nt|tlc: i think unless a known dbl fit exists, 6 ace keycard can be wrong|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not a convention i have ever played roland|pg||
nt|corplaw: since 2N denies a singleton (usually), case could be made for 6 card RKC|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tlc: they play 2NT is just a forcing spade raise..it doesnt deny a singleton|pg||
mc|13|nt|corplaw: they play splinters too, so usually 2N would not have singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: A short break here|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Same with  1@S  2@H (GF)  ;   3@H   3@S    should there not be 6 keycards again?|pg||
nt|tlc: that auction i agree with 6 ace RKC|pg||
nt|tlc: i thk a known dbl fit has to exist for it to be playable|pg||
nt|corplaw: but agree, it's not a guarantee.  sometimes see 6 card RKC when responder has strong 2 suiter opposite 1N or 2N opening|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, most europeans favor specific 2-suited overcalls as opposed to Michaels|pg||
nt|riccho: this hand is an example for that|pg||
nt|riccho: last hand... |pg||
nt|lml: they should get to slam on this one|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: 15 to 17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this week i've seen most variations of Ghestem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good minor shapes for D here but stiff heart is worrisome|pg||
nt|lml: anybody in this field who misses it will be embarrassed|pg||
nt|riccho: 6@s is a must for a serious partnership here, or?|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@h pass or correct as before.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: 4@h was down in the other room|pg||
nt|mamos: what should West do now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: without a diamond play from East on the previous board Sementa tried the double diamond hook and went down|pg||
nt|lml: the key play was the return by east when in on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|tlc: this is another hadn where all participants will get their money's worth in the auction...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all those variations about the same....yyour Ghestem's as good as mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I do not promise I get all the spots right every hand, but he did not play KH|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|mamos: he's gone for Pass|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass is expected by west.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Good lead by Balicki.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: haven't noticed that bridge players "do" embarassment|pg||
nt|dburn: 7 IMPs to Fleischer came on board 5, where delcarer in this room took a seriously wrong (but entirely reasonable) view of the club suit in 1NT|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|lml: this hand does play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: thx April...normally in that situation after a finesse one plays the card one is known to hold|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT strong spade raise, 3@h natural, 3@s waiting - no shortage - 4@d short diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oliverc: well the @H position means this will not play too bad, but it remains to be seen|pg||
nt|oliverc: whether it's a good result|pg||
nt|bobh1: the italians play a space-age version of stayman apparently|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know what 2@D is sorry.  Let me find a convention card|pg||
nt|mamos: Club position is crucial to the number of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a minimum -3 for 800.  Another good pickup for Cayne.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you haven't worked as vugraph operator you should know that the ABSOLUTE toughest part of the job is play of the hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|oliverc: J@H a nice shot|pg||
nt|panosk: as cards ly same to finess or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: disagree|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry me too|pg||
nt|panosk: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|lml: 2@D was 18019 BAL|pg||
nt|lml: no five card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2D i have, the 2S is a picture bid with 3 options. the 3S clarifies the option.  As far as I can tell,. |pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h improvisation - "last train" not actually part of the methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|lml: well guessed by McAvoy though|pg||
nt|kareno: Now a club shift needed so club doesn't go away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sorry I am told it was ferraro not sementa who played 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2S sementa was asking|pg||
nt|dburn: Blackwood, one key card...|pg||
nt|riccho: looks like you know NS very well... :)|pg||
nt|lml: so far one pair has missed the slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ...stumbling towards Blackwood|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: Lorenzo showed 5+H and 4+D GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many players never let you see their cards, most just give you a glimpse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thanks Al! I agree.|pg||
nt|riccho: and their mothods|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I do have the WBF convention card open now|pg||
nt|lml: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|lml: this is actually a decent slam|pg||
nt|lml: all you need to do is bring home the hearts missing five to the jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it is my dylexia|pg||
nt|bobh1: needed a @d lead here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Lauria will try|pg||
nt|lml: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they are not on the same page then. 6D was written|pg||
nt|dburn: I have played with them both once or twice|pg||
nt|lml: the team is Belgium Cooreman so we can all know which team needs to be embarrased|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: which was once too often for Malinowski - we missed a game, and he vowed never to play with me again|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: yes defence is very strong  both E and W have very clear idea of what they are doing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|bobh1: would like to know more about their auction to see if that would be reasonable|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin asked about key cards, V answered 3|pg||
nt|lml: the convention card suggest hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am going with your version, but I can see the hands :)|pg||
nt|lml: well they have got to the right spot and even if they confused the opponents it doesnt affect the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: pointed out N is on lead|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: their methods made it easy to find the slam |pg||
nt|tlc: niice D pitch by lew..now martel knew when to take the ace|pg||
nt|kareno: High spade calling for a diamond.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|lml: so now Versace has to make it|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is now completely cold|pg||
nt|lml: but Versace is thinking what could go wrong|pg||

nt|hedyg: for running scores: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|lml: he is trying not to just pull trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin shaking his head as he put the 3D down on the table. |pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what is in his head|pg||
nt|lml: Versace not Shenkin|pg||
nt|lml: Shenkin is shaking his head about previous boards|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|lml: brb .. need a bathroom break|pg||
nt|bobh1: held to 2 at the other table|pg||

nt|bobh1: so some imps will go in the italian direction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: by then he may have forgotten :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: yes I know he is thinking about trump reduction but playing the @HK first instead of second seems better to me|pg||

nt|marlowepi: lets do the time warp again|pg||

nt|kareno: 6@h makes (better by north but the diamond is onside so it doesn't matter).|pg||
nt|dburn: hide your eyes, Roland|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is this the last pair using Flannery in the world?|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Flanery - limited opening bid, five hearts, four spades|pg||
nt|riccho: flannery??|pg||
nt|lml: no there are at least 3 others]|pg||
nt|riccho: stone age convention resurrected|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose it might just fit into your methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for an explanation|pg||
nt|tlc: mind numbing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: less clear than MUD|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: 2@H is weak and 2NT is asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asking|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: most probably |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually had a bid to describe exactly 5@D & 4@C  but  those @C .... yuk|pg||
nt|kareno: Normal heart play works (for the drop).|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, a who's who of Flannery players is being delivered to me|pg||
nt|riccho: IÂ´m told that hamman-zia and weinstein-levin still play flannery|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT or 3NT or pass|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing wrong with Flannery at all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sufficiently high level to constitute a STRONG recommendation|pg||
nt|lml: which one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I didn't think Roland allowed the F-word|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: ty April :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he doesnt have four clubs. he has 2 low doubletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that like  @SA  @HA  @DA  @CA  is just 2-pair|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N jand not enhanced by S bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I saw that McAvoy underled the diamond honors and declarer went wrong.. well done|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: D & Z discussing something - I think that 2@c promised 4|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand for 2@C so is now probably worrying about going on|pg||
nt|riccho: the best with flannery is, that you cannot play another stupid 2level opening obstruction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether they have a clear agreement on 2NT here|pg||
nt|lml: well it probably made the north south auction tougher here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 3@d showed 2 top hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe, but I get lots of weak hands and not many 5/4 openers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hope I am not too late|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi bob|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Bob, not at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: only K@H is off side, rest all good|pg||
nt|lml: but denied a maximum or 6-4|pg||
nt|riccho: X from N is what every intervention by NS is... |pg||
nt|riccho: aggressive|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: I don't like it either but it was effective here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: well, West passed in first seat and East may be light in third - double is normal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North has to X - as a passed hand it's not a big issue|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: 4S just too much with those red slowballs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4??   whoa baby|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S at most. if S can make 4S facing this tripe he will bid it over 3S 97% of the time|pg||
nt|tlc: hope springs eternal|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panosk: possible swing in the last board, thats all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been reminded Martel-Stansby actually were on Rose Meltzer's winning team of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: this is the Worlds and IMPs!!!|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|lml: cute lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: most of the field is in 3NT which will do well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|riccho: long time studies with 2l-openings showed, that WK2 openings have a minus expected value|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: now that is a problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: Shenkin wide awake ruffing high|pg||
nt|lml: well done VanCLeeff|pg||
nt|lml: the opening lead set declarer up and now the trump promotion takes him down|pg||
nt|lml: that should cheer up north-south|pg||
nt|lml: staring at it will not help Versace|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Versace is thinking hard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact S might bid 4S over 3S with his actual hand, so even 3S seems ambitious, especially NV. curious that N would be so ambitious here in a set where NS have heretofore shown ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: consistent prudence in regard to NV games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room where Zagorin overcalled 1@S and Bathurst bid 2@S in comp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: it certainly is!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great question from spec:  was @D8 signal for @H?         very possible - or reverse count with 5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: he has too many trump to endplay north|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: "how could he underlead the ace????"|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since South could be pretty strong - that's the thing about Flannery: a hand that would bid 1NT over 1@h cannot so easily bid 2NT over 2@d|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: of this score were to hold up at the end of the set Rayner would overtake Lavazza who would drop to third place|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobh1: the Canadians will pick up an imp on this board due to a better lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: in this case -- both answers work|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|mamos: the defence has a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: they probably are not aware of how far behind they are|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: after the 2H cue by S, the chance of driving NS a level higher are not bad, despite them being 2 passed hands|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tlc: this hand illustrates the down side to a nebulous 1D...it's hard for partner to compete when he would otherwise|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: we should see some imps coming in for Auken soon|pg||
nt|hedyg: got 1!!!|pg||
nt|lml: a club now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or it's too late|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: Jon made an overtrick in 6@H|pg||
nt|lml: the did get out of the schneider|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsk: rewoke|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it would be altogether ridiculous to open the South hand a strong no trump, but South is not the sort of player who goes in for that sort of thing|pg||
nt|lml: needed the club through|pg||
nt|lml: she can now either play a spade or play the top diamond and then a spade|pg||
nt|lml: int the latter case Marteil will be endplayed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: and meanwhile both minors may be viable at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like if the redouble does show a high honor, then heart lead would be good with that west hand - you give up a trick but get four quickly after that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z smiling, joking with D - guess he liked the result of his club switch|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: true, but there is almost surely a three level fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: but i think all of the hand types for 4th seat 1@D mean there is either a minor fit OR partner has BAL 15-16|pg||

nt|kareno: So far Cayne pitching a shutout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: okay off the schneider... thanks guys|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mamos: today's matches are 56 boards in four stanzas|pg||
nt|dburn: weak 2@d available if South elects to use it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: strong club with symmetric relay system here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT is on NS but i doubt anybody can get there...|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs looks a likely partscore for n/s.  |pg||
nt|mamos: for me 2@C would be Stayman|pg||
nt|kareno: Really, only 56.  In our US events we start (and end) with 64 board matches.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would be bidding 3@c to play.  2@c would be stayman for me too.|pg||
nt|mamos: roland told me 56  so ...... I believe him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: really do not like that call|pg||
nt|dburn: but now it gets a bit ugly, because North's 2@h is (as I recall) not forcing|pg||
nt|lml: It doesnt help Martel to split on the previous round.  South wins and playes a spade and Martel is endplayed in the blacks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzsv: 2D does not promise diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: W gambles that E has a few|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: tesla has interesting hand pattern so i believe he'll ask several relays and settle in game when he finds out nothing awesome at west's hand|pg||
nt|lml: I am told it is 18-19 BAL with no 5 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thx you all know more than I do :)  not a lot of talking going on here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H now by S?|pg||
nt|kareno: We must believe Roland (or die) :)|pg||
nt|riccho: Here u can see the advantage of a flannery opening... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: presumably this is transfer|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s transfer I imagine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow he bid it!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect that on this sequence by W, E will know that W has diamond length|pg||
nt|lml: North is very strong for 2@H if it is not forcing ... I know he has a diamond void but|pg||
nt|riccho: S agrees with your statement here david|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he must have seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: If this is the route to 5@D I like the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was a lucky make next door|pg||
nt|dburn: South might have bid anyway, since she has an above-average hand for hearts|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nice 9 count with Hx in @H - worth a try|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if Nystrom didn't like @D - he could bid 3-card major with zero points|pg||
nt|tlc: nystrom's dbl indicates he has passed a likely 6-7 pt hand and wants to let his partner in on the secret..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has passed 1D but now shown some values, so he was willing to play diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: Makes 3 or 4 depending heart guess.  More tea anyone?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: 56 is a long day for the WBF - Bermuda Bowl & Olympiad are 48 board days (3 16s). I think that here the later rounds (donÃ t know what that means though 'R8 or semi) will be 60.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Sorry about that Ã  I canÃ t find the apostrophe|pg||
nt|lml: she might but I think a pass can be forgiven|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think she was (rightly) ashamed of it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: yes commentating is a tough job........|pg||
nt|hedyg: what they dont wont do to prove us wrong..|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Natural lead. Not sure what the doubled asked for in the other room|pg||
nt|tlc: with some good guessing this may come home...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: i understand both tables got there.|pg||
nt|dburn: but of the 150 conventions in the world worse than Flannery, non-forcing responses to weak two bids are a very long way up the list|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri: east knows west's hand pattern but i believe he's restricted to 8-11 from 1@s initial response|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be a heart as we see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these guesses should be indicated|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: agreed |pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: N has shown a good hand|pg||
nt|tlc: agreed|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahri: figured out he does not have slam unless west has absolutely perfect hand (AAK) which might be restricted anyway.|pg||
nt|ahri: restricted as in "bid differently" :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Cayne has now taken the lead in his group|pg||
nt|riccho: I think its worth a post mortem discussion if u get in 2@h with 25 combined points here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Singleton king is often a good holding for notrump. It's a "certain" stopper with LHO on lead if he has the ace and if his partner has it, South must still find the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not here because he had an attractive alternative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS  have no effective options that i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: and we get to see all 4 hands|pg||

nt|riccho: at least here 3NT is a fine contract|pg||
nt|dburn: they cater for a very wide range of hands where you ought to play in a part score - they make it very difficult to play in normal game contracts|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: ho hum   another 1570 hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you have a weird little computer there!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's true, but if you ant to move toward game you can start with 2NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: they may have to rethink this 2@d convention|pg||
nt|lml: www.bridgeblogging.com .. spelling error|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: This is GROUP C|pg||
nt|lml: so Shenking is showing hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: exactly 5H and 4 or more in a minor|pg||
nt|lml: there was one other pair in 2@H so far and one in 6|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: sure you can, but then no one knows whether you are bidding suits or stoppers or anything|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: aggressive 2N bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: no kidding!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's not too hard to design a method that handles that|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his black suits in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobh1: if u lose the preemptive effect of the way other pairs use 2@d and things like this can also happen...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think this is one of the exceptional hands with which S should bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boring after his recent 5206 |pg||
nt|mamos: i think this is forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I'm sure that on balance there isn't much between the approaches|pg||
nt|lml: with 5-5 that does seem like the right approach although his suits are a bit ratty|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: well this is what you get for X with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what the double is about but it may help to get to the slam|pg||
nt|lml: which of course fails|pg||
nt|lml: I am still trying to understand the double.  Maybe he though he was too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are a couple of other suits to consider besides spades...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: announced as halftime... noted that these guys are quite ahead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I didnÃ t see an alert, but often people donÃ t alert forcing NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so pick one that suits your ... temperament|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had a choice of cuebids -- 2@h is probably natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Another strong result for Slovakia|pg||
nt|ahri: very.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s not enough, 4@s too final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW may never get in here|pg||
nt|ahri: 4@s should fail too i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||

nt|lml: will south sell?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yep|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahri: i like how bidding is completely different from other room. minors in action here, majors there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is a cheap save vs 4@H (if they find it, but 5@D is also on|pg||
nt|lml: I thought that might happen|pg||
nt|tlc: 4s here should do the trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess it isn't forcing.  Good contract.  More tea :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahri: 4@h can be set by two diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i find 4H dubious. even if pd has 3 hearts, 5D could easily prove a much better game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby just completing his shape with 4@H  -- well 5@H 6+@D|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Stanicic should have bid 3@H instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not overcall 1@H, so 3@H shows a diamond fit too|pg||
nt|ahri: and almost surely 4 cards.|pg||
nt|ahri: or 5 very bad ones|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|ahri: quite gentle auction here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no discussion of result -- the orginal Blue Team taught us that is good for partnership|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Handsome lead going into the last 12 boards|pg||
nt|ahri: ops, two imps :)|pg||
nt|lml: the hearts can set up|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tactical, or systemic?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobh1: the auction in the other room was very weak imo|pg||
nt|lml: the momentum has really swung around in this match, amazing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kareno: With diamonds friendly and the spade guess pretty clear, this can make 4.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: the S hand is too good for a weak jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: McAvoy sorry if this is wrong I have no HCPs|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but you have distro out the kazoo|pg||
nt|lml: its always good to apologize when you think you are making it|pg||
nt|lml: I never apologize when I think we are going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: much better than being confident and going down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it might be very close now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: shenkin, wow, nice hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: he's max HCP -- wonder how much stronger the hand can get  [just kidding  @SQx dubious value]|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: North might have thought about doubling 1@H I suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 2@c bid by E since the double by W is usually mainly for majors and could have a doubleton @C|pg||
nt|lml: but his hearts are a bit ragged|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores are back|pg||
nt|kareno: But not a game to bid even vul, I would say.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: Belgians on a role +1 on successive boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you don't think S would have balanced over 1@D-P-P?|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt it|pg||
nt|lml: can make as much as four now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|ahri: some people ask what's the halftime score for 3rd place, roland, do you have any info?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: with the 22 @s's this is home free|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lml: most roads lead to 7 or 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzsk: interesting bidding|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: all aproaches work here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: The Cayne team will happily give away an IMP here and there :)  So this is the antepenultimate board of the set.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: now a @H?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|ahri: a push, so this is the halftime score|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Zia always tells me that you should respond on bad hands if you think the opponents might make 3NT, but not if you don't|pg||
nt|lml: Martel had every reason to believe they could make it|pg||
nt|lml: so he was following the ZIa rule|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you should follow Zia's advice when it is correct too David, but not otherwise|pg||
nt|riccho: as with every rule... |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I always follow it anyway - I get shouted at less|pg||

nt|lml: the Italians are being taken minus.  The Canadians already had 25 VP before the last board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am wondering what the balance sheet is on playing superaccept & weak NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should get to slkam here|pg||
nt|kareno: Misguessing spades.  Why?  I think he hopes the spade ace is with east in case they bid the game in the OR.|pg||
nt|mamos: that really didt make much sense |pg||
nt|riccho: yes its so easy to make the mistakes which partner advised to|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, on that hand he'd probably have shouted at me anyway for not raising spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, Zia is a coach? I had no idea|pg||
nt|riccho: no rubber bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not all rubber players give lessons|pg||
nt|riccho: at rubber bridge it pays to punish partner for his mistakes|pg||
nt|riccho: you get him twice back as an opponent|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, de Botton picked up eight IMPs in bits and pieces - six for a fearless balance by Sandqvist on 9 and (remarkably) 2 when the combined 25 count was played in 2@d and not ...|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good buy|pg||
nt|lml: since four of a minor is available north south|pg||
nt|lml: bye now heading for dinner|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Auken has taken over the lead group lead|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR on the earlier hand East just bid 4@d over the heart preempt and will be surprised perhaps ito win imps|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|bobh1: this slam can be defeated|pg||
nt|lml: Rayner has moved into a tie for first in the division|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: W led the @c A|pg||
nt|lml: they cashed the @ca at trick one and it was all over|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe at mps that lead is normal|pg||
nt|lml: This tournament is being played in Philadelphia USA|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps?|pg||
nt|lml: so we are near a tie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S, 4@S [if Kickback],  what other options?     nope never thought about 4@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy contender for "filthy  overcall of the year" honors|pg||
nt|mamos: just lost an imp|pg||
nt|kareno: I would bid 1nt (if it is in range) with four hearts and diamonds, but not with spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: (1 lead too many )|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why that got alerted - just a limit raise, as far as I know|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4@H surely|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a limit raise has become artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: S alerted. however N did not|pg||
nt|riccho: unusual convention |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he might, but 3@h may have the feel of a pre-balance, so I guess he could pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: let me look at the auction|pg||
nt|tlc: it has my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute treatment  ---   i was going to guess a version of Swiss with bad trump|pg||
nt|riccho: well done martel|pg||
nt|dburn: he did pass|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well done|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|bobh1: leading unsupported aces is not a growth industry at imps|pg||
nt|lml: 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: i meant|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z's DBL showed a 5 card Major and another suit at least 4 cards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: oh i c|pg||
nt|lml: if the bidding is accurate East pysched a club cuebid|pg||
nt|kareno: Stoppers in both majors and hopes for the club suit.  |pg||
nt|kareno: North needed the eight of clubs this time.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: I'm about to designate Z as the best player to be a VG operator for - he explains things very clearly with gestures so I can figure out what he's said :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Gee, gestures and he isn't even Italian :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: trust your opponents|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobh1: there seems to have been a lead-director|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: so West had to lead a club really|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: sementa did not think of that|pg||
nt|lml: well north south may as well be there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|tlc: "last train" for any specs that might wonder means "I want to make a final slam try, but have nothing specific to say without getting past game"|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: same lead though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace not inventing anything here, just leading his longest suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads|pg||
nt|hedyg: so the 3@c is a bit surprising|pg||
nt|lml: with Shenkin as declarer and given this deal is complex it will take away|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has been pretty quick so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described as 3 and 5th leads|pg||
nt|lml: yes amazing|pg||
nt|lml: but this time I think it will be slower|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: he could duck this club seems right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: some might lead @d thinking pd cannot have soemthing like KQJ in @c to make it a good lead|pg||
nt|lml: we will see (eventually)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be quick claim too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: typically it is an artificial use of the call just below the game level|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: they were kind enough to write that one down for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Jan you are the best Operator - you bring the room to life for us as well as following the play and explanations.  I'm always happy to see you in my room :)  Thanks again!!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: so Bob what do you think?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: he found the @c lead without the lead-director|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: Lauria doesnt really have a clear club count|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3/5 could be from 873|pg||
nt|lml: anyway as the spades lie I am pretty confident this hand will be made|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: he thought maybe Sementa had the stiff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: certainly is possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: The cards just won't stretch for nine tricks.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzsv: Tough hand to defend though - Z must be worried that another spade will be declarer's 9th trick, not knowing about those minor suit spots in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He can be patient about the spade.  Meanwhile, north is playing on diamonds - if clubs were solid I think he'd be going after his ninth trick in hearts.  |pg||
nt|kareno: South, that is,|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Although, if the @d6 is upside down count, either partner has those higher spots or declarer only has 3 spades (with 6 @ds)|pg||

nt|dburn: 2@s is natural but unlimited - difficult call for North here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is the auction GF yet?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s was in theory forcing to game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: presumably it is, so 3@C looks OK|pg||
nt|riccho: sandqvist followed the zia rules and bid not only 1@h but raised to 2@s (Bd12) -1 |pg||
nt|riccho: -1 after partner bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia is allowed to pass 1@s if partner will be declarer in four, but partner is not allowed to pass if Zia will be declarer in four|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: well the lecture I had was it was too dangerous but on the other hand people bid on such air these days ///|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: that she is!|pg||
nt|lml: we have a new leader|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: you all are awesome too!!!  |pg||
nt|lml: Auken has taken the lead|pg||
nt|lml: on the previous board they played in partscore and not 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|lml: they had pretty well an identical auction except ..|pg||
nt|lml: here South accepted an invitation and in the OR declined|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think you have to bid 1NT on every bad 15 count but this is a big 17 |pg||
nt|lml: it was a think game true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, probably 6C. E will lay down club ace. then NS can both get style points for playing the jack and queen :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only thing known about West hand [without peeking] is that he is Game Force, but not @S fit with shortness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think this system is designed for E to need to know anything about W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i'm not suggesting to pass|pg||
nt|lml: north south do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|bobh1: but even if you do, 1@h is forcing so you will have another chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "pragmatic" 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner needs very right cards for 6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: An accurate route to the excellent slam is found by B/K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Z, laughing, "invitation"|pg||
nt|mamos: It's difficult to see much future in this match for the Belgians  --  really great  start for Cayne|pg||
nt|kareno: Last board of the set.  Specs, don't give up your seats - lots of great bridge to come.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: Now, Z has asked B to show him his hand, so he can claim. Then says something about smoking :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: but you are vulnerable ... here RED means GO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice contract -- whatever the auction meant|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: I have an auction with explanations from a spec:  the explanations are wrong: 1@C polish, 1@S 7+ 4+@S, 2@D 3+@S GF 2@H 7-9(10) exactly 4@S 4@D splinter etc|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|lml: they need to take their club trick .. yep|pg||
