nt|swanson: took|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so they started brd 17|pg||
nt|toral5: another dull push coming up|pg||
nt|ady: so declarr played a trump|pg||
nt|tlc: hi karen and alan :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are off|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fasten your seatbelts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tlc: Fasten your seatbelts...showtime!|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: spectators are expecting some early fireworks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: zia is the action man|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Traian and last he made an error was in 1987|pg||
nt|algraves: no this is the well known meckwell and the great young Israeli pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: loool|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|splinter|nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: no one steals from West|pg||
nt|algraves: we are finding out what system they play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: i did not see any alertes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: North opened 2@D (multi) in CR, almost forced EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 22 hcp 3NT  CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yuval Yener and David Burn|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzta: more imps now for nickel|pg||
nt|dburn: except perhaps East, who thinks his partner might have something|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW plays 2/1 with transfers in responses over 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
nt|toral5: though @D ace is a gold card in pds suit,poor trump suit might force him to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nickell|pg||
nt|algraves: so this plays well with the friendly hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: nothing too fancy|pg||
nt|kareno: David, you know my feelings on the subject - you must get in the auction when it is appropriate and this time \i feel it is definitely appropriate :)|pg||
nt|tlc: and the friendly clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: probably 9 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asking about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably too much action|pg||
nt|dburn: this looks like quite a lot of bidding|pg||
mb|5D|nt|algraves: for sure 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: this is where you are supposed to run the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play israeli standard souped up no doubt which is a straight forward natural approach |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||
nt|algraves: undoubtedly very good card players and fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: looks that 5d was prefered in the closed as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about the 9 @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is a@C|pg||
nt|toral5: east/west leads low frm dblton|pg||
nt|toral5: @C lead puts declarer under severe pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe he can make it if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ady: did have 2 hearts  1 spade   and K@D on 3rd heart   but not now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe the auction indicated a club lead - not sure exactly what the later rounds meant, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance for a swing from the word go|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jkotor: 9 = singleton or 3+ with 1 higher|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: or, of course, not play on hearts at all - although I am not quite sure why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: not today :(|pg||
nt|toral5: declarer forced to rise with @C ace on a @C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant defeat 4@H, but on a @C-lead decl will prob take @CA and try to sidcard 2 @Cs on @d|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|toral5: yes.it always makes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: have to say 3NT   ambitious  in CR    but came home|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it would be good if he had, wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|toral5: kq trumps are nicely placed for helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: now, though, he won't make it|pg||
nt|algraves: well he wont make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: may be ducking the spade was wiser|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jkotor: i think he is winning in the different boards|pg||
nt|pelu: carefull unblocing @DA|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time now|pg||
nt|toral5: praying that becker doesnt have @C 10 and single @S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|swanson: Would the 9 or 10 be led for 10-9 doubleton, Jakub?|pg||
nt|algraves: yes Meckstroths opener seems to have fooled him a little|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|swanson: from|pg||
nt|jkotor: 10 is 109 for 98% of Polish|pg||
nt|jkotor: but 2 from 92|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm sure he was confident that meck had the heart K for his opening bid...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: ..|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 10 from 102, yes? |pg||
mc|11|nt|jkotor: Hx is Honour lead in 4/2 polish style|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Martens thinks and takes the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we start with board  17 because the Women's Final for the McConnell Cup is playing 16 boards  |pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Curious arrangement.  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Good lead by Rodwell.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   Rosenblum started with 14 board matches, then 15 in Qtr & Semi  and I assume 16 boards in tomorrow Finals|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: spade to the jack and claimed|pg||
nt|dburn: ducking the spade would have been a bad idea if South held the king of hearts, which was what Pachtman was playing for|pg||
nt|algraves: well yes but then heshould have just played on hearts at trick two|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he was going to do that, he might as well have played on hearts earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inresting in this matchwe have Norway NS at both tables - in CR: Brogeland-SÃ¦lensminde|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jkotor: 10-16 this vul|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|algraves: oh well , easy when you see them all as they say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|yuval10: 1@h by E would've been 3 cards support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@c denies|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: West thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell Pachtman discussing system the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@d is forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL someone was complaining to me yesterday about the transfer responses - I had to explain that they are almost standard in some quarters of the expert community\|pg||
nt|yuval10: says nothing about @s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: @d sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: both sides of the screen writting explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i can see none of it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzta: 2h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman gave him 2 fingers|pg||
nt|algraves: so they play a standard start with a very modern approach after that with transfers and information requesting waiting bids etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's actually 'natural' after he already denied as many as three|pg||
nt|algraves: anad more to come no doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck did not know he is on lead lool|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzta: and HH landed in 3d|pg||
nt|algraves: the future will be to bid games giving away as little as possible|pg||
nt|algraves: and try and position NT contracts  if possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: E asked him do you know you are on lead?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|toral5: nice 2nd dbl from helgemo|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul thinking now|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT played the other way up, likely to make |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|toral5: looks like a make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|ady: thinking what to discard from dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks normal to pitch a diamond and play @HAx hoping for another trick somewhere|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: but there will be a 2nd discard|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jkotor: with blocking @c@c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzta: lets see now|pg||
nt|pelu: prob need to finess @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice support dummy has|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: going for hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|toral5: @D 9 cant be promoted cos north has a 4th @S pitch on @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: A small club now and south will make @CQ and @HK and no more|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
nt|ady: now must go up with ace|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has to win and hope @D are stopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment he is thinking|pg||
pc|s9|nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: better to duck with @dK|pg||
nt|algraves: well so he can try and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello People  I will try and stay awake for you:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi David|pg||

nt|udo: good evening|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Udo|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia plays @ds so defence play @ss|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defence have to switch and switch again|pg||
nt|udo: when i stop writing without saying good bye,,,i fell asleep,still jetlag,,today back from phili|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|toral5: he will lead a @D frm hand after taking @S pitch|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jtr: Just a @c and a @s to lose|pg||
pc|c8|nt|swanson: And this is now down two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta:  it is too fast :(|pg||
nt|jkotor: unless he takes 3 tricks :)|pg||
nt|algraves: but will only make 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: The defense might have cashed out for down two.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 decided by the lead it appears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D needed a club lead which Rodwell found and Ginossar did not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzta: zia thinking|pg||
nt|jtr: Why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: diamond king in his hand...|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he is also tired|pg||

nt|kareno: That needs a little help too in the spade suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: or a diamond break|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|kareno: Yes, but with a diamond break, diamonds would make, no?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17     meckwell 1N=14-16 or 15-17 |pg||
nt|passell: or 12 plus|pg||
nt|kareno: lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: in most cases  meckwell carding is  upside-down: count, attitude, suit-pref and reverse smith vs NT|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking down seeking divine guidance?|pg||
nt|tlc: he found it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D4 was original 4th best|pg||
nt|passell: likely spade back now|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, you don't defeat one notrump with one five-card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: both Meckstroth andRodwell take sips of their coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia-hamman same auction to 5@D on  17   lead is ...... @H2|pg||
nt|passell: it would put declarer to a guess if he king of spades instead of the queen|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|tlc: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will play in 3NT of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do they know how to be in front feels|pg||
mb|2D|nt|odysseus69: i have to admit to  strong bias in favour of Wolfson and hope i have arrived in time to see a late rally|pg||
nt|jtr: not the start needed by Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: and the hand lies relatively well for declarer so he will make it easily enough|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jkotor: yap, very good 3nt by Chechs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aww....|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate position in hearts    though always a good chance if 10@H is with west|pg||
mb|2N|nt|toral5: 2nt by east will be natural here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: incase he decides to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: east thought a bit but passed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|toral5: this very vulnerability wd ve demotivated him|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a X in East - but only if pd has a 5 card suit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: So far the deals have been good for the leading team - little chance of a swing|pg||
nt|algraves: he can guess the clubs for 3 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar asked : normal stayman auction, answer yes|pg||
nt|algraves: but only two will still see him home 3 in each red , 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: 3 NT looks quite normal,,but i cant see 9 trciks|pg||
nt|udo: after @S lead|pg||
nt|udo: a,i see, @H  come in|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, a @d to the Ace then @hs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: Lucky @d break in an odd way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well if he finds the diamond position he just plays on hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamman thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I am last of 3 at typing|pg||
nt|udo: this @D break has its advantage,,u see  first round there is no future|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: 5@c seems OK|pg||
nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
nt|algraves: some how it is always hard for the defense to hold these to 9 tricks |pg||
pc|s7|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Very dangerous to come in as partner could easily have four spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i lefy CR after a club lead- Rosenberg was in deep thought|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact he may get home even if @ds are 4-2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|algraves: so he guessses clubs straight away|pg||
nt|tlc: he still has to guess whether to drop the doubleton K or to pin the 9 tho|pg||
nt|algraves: so no he has 9 with spades still to be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes last set... and the table was slow...this set looks like flying|pg||
nt|algraves: well, he wont go wrong there east could have Q9xx|pg||
nt|tlc: for 3 club tricks anyway..|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: asking rodwell stuff...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now screen back up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ron Pachtman is the faster of the two. Ginossar has his tanks|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: back in hand now|pg||

nt|pelu: agree, Roland - absolut normal to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: hi Roland :)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jkotor: IMO he can double for T/O, @h jump will correct to NT|pg||
nt|dburn: this is presumably because the women have time for 16 boards in two and a half hours, while the men can manage only about 11|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: not plain sailing here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: Game is iffy to bid here after 1NT.  Hamman can show a good spade hand by bidding at the three level over Zia's xfer, but will Zia go on?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 3H may be re-transfer|pg||
nt|tlc: well done to get to the cold (albeit lucky) 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: this game is cold even if N would find the very inspired K@c lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he didn't|pg||
nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
nt|dburn: one wonders what Ginossar intended to do if Pachtman had actually bid 3@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: after N opened 2@s, it seem illogical to finesse to the T in that suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: in @h rather|pg||
nt|yuval10: good players tend not to open weak 2's with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck asked earlier for the session times to be changed and it seems the wish was granted|pg||
nt|algraves: well it seems he wants to get on @H straight away and if they are good for 5 tricks, then just give up a @D|pg||
nt|kareno: Do they play Lebensohl by a passed hand then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ginossar in the tank now|pg||
nt|algraves: nothing much to think about here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: can i tell him?|pg||
nt|algraves: anything but hearts from the top is illogical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you must tell him in Hebrew, Traian. Is that a challenge?|pg||
nt|algraves: my Hebrew is weak but I can call a lifeline|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: huge for me....i do speak the language|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: cant Zia ruff a 2nd spade with 10C   and draw trumps?|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: You can call Yuval, he is nearby|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson: A heart lead would have defeated 4@H because the discard must be taken immediatly - the East can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|rmb1: East must play a diamond now as the defence's only source of tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: Enough for five tricks?  I am asked.  Declarer has entry problems, may not get to enjoy the spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: can transfer any message via juniors' friends, which are also playing at the same time the world championship for juniors' teams|pg||
nt|algraves: so Rodwell will switch to clubs and hold this to three|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i missed the NOT...i do not speak the language|pg||

nt|algraves: this may be a long set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck said sorry.. and he is taking his ahare of the tank now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manual for Vugraph Operators, page 17, paragraph 5, lines 8 and 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: share|pg||
nt|tlc: perhaps west will help meck out and just claim ...|pg||
nt|algraves: I have thought that some variation of the chess clock principle but where it applies to total team time at all 4 seats|pg||
nt|algraves: not including system explanantions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: funny enough the director kept last set the exact time of each pair|pg||
nt|algraves: so you have a total team time of say 2hrs|pg||
nt|tlc: If Joey were the Operator, could he just yell NEXT at the appropriate time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now..who want to know the result?|pg||
nt|algraves: so that takes into account that NS and EW may have much different problems|pg||
nt|algraves: and if you have a very fast pair , well that helps if you have a very slow pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we had fantunes and greco-hampson|pg||
nt|algraves: and vice versa|pg||
nt|algraves: so after you play you hit the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meck stil in the tank|pg||
nt|algraves: I guess you could only do it during the play|pg||
nt|algraves: but that would be a big help|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@c discard looks logical|pg||
nt|kareno: Many years ago, when he was sstill a student at MIT, I asked Mark Feldman what he was thinking about on every bid and play.  He told me he was reviewing every hand he had ever ...|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: lot of talk from specks   about hand 19     Zia played high trump early from hand  -  maybe better to not touch trumps early   A@S   and ruff a spade  and then diamond finesse   ...|pg||
nt|ady: and if tghe play goes the same way   diamond back   ruff another spade with 10C    then has ace and another club to draw trumps  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Rosenberg made 3NT on 19 - |pg||

mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|odysseus69: 1h- t/fer= 2 spades - a weak NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 2@S was too high I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: According to the Rule of 15, Helness has an opener. HCP + spades must add up to at least 15 if you go by Pesrson's Rule|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Pearson's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   looks 1 over the top |pg||

nt|odysseus69: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i lost the play... i had to close the screen|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think they lead the 10 from this holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Ginossar went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and i had to protect the screen|pg||
mc|7|nt|yuval10: might've played @d to the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is strange|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Rosenberg asks if his pd told Meck that he has better diamonds than hearts and his pd says not yet, but he would have gotten around to it|pg||
nt|passell: notice rodwell choosing to defend with the nice 10 count  knowing he had an 8 card fit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: East's hand is quite limited however.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

mb|1H|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
nt|bt: thx and good 2 c u all|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: minor games look good|pg||
nt|swanson: That was a very quiet looking hand on which to win 10 IMPs.  BUt the Nickell team needs three more of the same.|pg||
nt|kareno: No losers in spades but are there enough winners for a grand slam?  |pg||
mb|r|nt|jkotor: what is your call after 1@h from E?|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see how many @d's will E bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 4|pg||
nt|algraves: notice that Mecksroth took zero time to play that a guess is a guess , lets get on to the next board|pg||
nt|algraves: he probably always plays it that way|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, his partnership has little think time to spare :)|pg||
nt|udo: zia 1 @H:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 3 looks good to me|pg||
nt|udo: to good for a vuln weaktwo ?|pg||
nt|udo: or weak3|pg||
nt|davidb: E  thunks  they playing with 2 decks of cards|pg||
nt|davidb: think|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: NE writing notes|pg||

nt|udo: 2@D and later 3!@C looks fine, |pg||
mb|2N|an|minors|nt|jkotor: I m also for X|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h = 5+@s or 11-13 bal, game force|pg||
nt|yuval10: don't think 3@d will confuse NS much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably best to start with simple 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bt: an interesting hand coming up, , can ns make 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H opening is creative; not sure how many would do that|pg||
nt|udo: dont think 2@D will be passed out,,,after this start|pg||
nt|davidb: nice imaginative bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2NT = @D ?|pg||
nt|kareno: Does 3@d break up their relays if anyone knows?|pg||
nt|udo: but when u have this 2 NT, thats perfect|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: N can bid easy 3@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what else?|pg||
nt|stoffers: Looks like 9 tricks in either @h or @s here, even only 8 in @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can they make 3?|pg||
nt|bt: helgemo has a tough choice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helgemo thinking now|pg||
nt|stoffers: he had to bid like he did i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|toral5: problm for helgemo here|pg||
nt|yuval10: then S can cuebid and show his great hand against @s suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell writing a book for pachtman |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: His opener was not a thing of beauty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: some wouldnt open the south hand, i hear :-)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the trouble is that he might bid 2NT here with shape and little values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, AKQxxx you can show when asked after a weak 2. It's a rare bird but here it is|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tlc: surprised no 4@d cue|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass might've already showed some good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@d voidwood|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's the only reason|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 is not a bad contract without a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and more writing...i can see 3-4 pages until now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2NT  ;  3NT   solid suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: his opener needs beauty therapy|pg||
nt|bt: upgrading KQ doubleton, lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8 losers, KQ doubleton, vulnerable. Call me a chicken, but I pass|pg||
nt|toral5: 200 looks bad here|pg||

pc|c2|nt|bt: live by the sword ... |pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|jkotor: some people bid 2@h|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks if it is his lead and then plays the heart king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT 2 keycards outside diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@c now asks non @d kings, but 6@d would ask for @c help specifically|pg||

nt|Walddk4: or  Hvor er din Ã¥bningshÃ¥nd, makker?|pg||
nt|bt: there is a subtle squeeze on east in pointed suit but thats after going one down already|pg||
nt|stoffers: I am surprised that one of the world's best players gets it for his light opening. I think he has played more hands than us together and have an idea of whats best in the long run. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the one you had when you opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nope... english plain|pg||
nt|stoffers: I wouldnt open, but its a border hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now...thinking|pg||
nt|bt: sorry, but i didnt hear anyone critizising|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Helness I mean|pg||
nt|bt: its a fact that players like meckwell make a good living on light openers|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and a lot of sighs|pg||
nt|stoffers: Just 15 specs and some coments that looked like it :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|passell: no problem without trump lead|pg||
nt|algraves: so this will make |pg||
nt|yuval10: N figure up he've heared enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: after E will fail to lead trump ( from his void ) , 3 @c ruffs will make the contract easily|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|rmb1: I guess declarer loses two hearts and a diamond, but losing spade goes on a heart|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|yuval10: and 6@s in the CR, so new leaders|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: He is surely much better than the rest of us, but that should not mean that we can't question the opening. No-one critizised him|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It works for him, fine|pg||
nt|toral5: i m sure MOST would pass souths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: dont care about the spect - they are spect and Helgemo the player :)|pg||
nt|toral5: no question of criticizing at all|pg||
nt|bt: now the other question is how to get away with light openers like this in a natural framework and no conventions, thats a mystery to me|pg||
nt|toral5: meckwell will SURELY open|pg||
nt|toral5: and so will versace:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because they judge so well and are great card players, Lars|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he gave a distinct look to the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|toral5: ya i agree they are super card players|pg||
nt|pelu: opening is the best attack - and u dont have a 2@D overcall later on 5 cards suit and vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in hand now|pg||

pc|s8|nt|vugraphztb: an interesting return|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell asks for the opps convention card|pg||

nt|tlc: they got to the moysian 2@s and managed to make it|pg||

nt|kareno: For the specs, gmta = Great minds think alike!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're seeing exciting 1/2 imp swings at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell pulls the screen down and writes a questionand looks at the convention card, with more whispering|pg||

mb|1C|nt|bt: 1@H-D-2H-2S maybe|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You were wrong re 23, Lars. Brogeland passed the South cards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Double showed spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|jkotor: 6@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: both|pg||
nt|swanson: This would be uncharted waters for most partnerships.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if South bids 5@S now, North may well bid 7 - no, 6@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: not finished|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H was more positive than pass- enough for Zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: pachtman looking for action...asking questions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment hamman writing stuff for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Now 6@S and then 7@S?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: time for spaes now|pg||
nt|bt: aha ... lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he passed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only hopr for defence is if Zia decides to play anti-odds for K doubleton club with West - no chance really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too flat to act|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves: game bidding harder|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: surely this must be a 2-suiter  |pg||

pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last pass from Hamman was very quick- should have at least given it a thought|pg||
nt|swanson: Evidently Hamman knew how little Zia might have for the auction.  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: not good at all except that it makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia unwrapped another cough drop before the dummyhit the table|pg||
nt|jkotor: what if Zia have: QJxx xxx x AQTxx?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: East and West get some water while Zia contemplates the hand|pg||
nt|swanson: But maybe he could hold: xxxx, Qx, x, AQJxxx?  Nothing is clear after the 3@D opening.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Wouldn't W.C. Fields rather be here in Philadelphia?|pg||
nt|pelu: EW in 4@S over 4@H in CR|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||

nt|toral5: after a long time we have a slam|pg||

nt|stoffers: 4@S rkcb I GUESS|pg||

pc|s9|nt|bt: it is difficult bidding slam w Axxxxx opposite Kxxx when missing an ace, and asking for aces |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: rodwell asked if 6nt is quantitative|pg||
nt|passell: surprised w didnt bid 3diamonds first|pg||
nt|kareno: Me too - 6nt is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wofson back in the lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: South could have made last hand if he chose to believe @D K as singleton, we leave it to you at home to work it out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: claiming and not playing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say I admire the 2NT bid but no doubt all will be well|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Friendly lie for Zia|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: 2C alerted - maybe non-forcing?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jtr: Nice duck|pg||

nt|kareno: A pitcher of water will do that to you.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: a director was called to chaperone the three, but since there were three of them, sometimes they can go to the restroom together|pg||

nt|pelu: West could D = extra vaues - and East could pass|pg||
nt|ady: North happy|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for sure|pg||
nt|tlc: bd 26|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin used to call notrumps, "grabbits,"  first to bid them grabs them :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|spades|nt|vugraphzta: Zia waggled the one spade bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: 4@H = i have extras, hearts controlled and am interested in higher, could that be wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room is being broadcasted in the VG theatre|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so we have a lot of cameras around us|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think most top pairs wil reach 6@c on this hand. So many points and trumps together. Hard to find out its on a finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Certain symmetry.  East has AQ... in South's suit, so bids the suit that North has AQ.... and noone can bid any more|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: and 2 cameramans|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bt: problem w 3@S is that it is ambigious|pg||
nt|toral5: most pairs will surely land in 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: atleast the top ones|pg||
nt|stoffers: gÃ¥r an Ã¥ spille pÃ¥ ja|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Sry, that was private, meaning he COULD go down playing N for K@h and Q@s|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H by west wd have made life easy for becker i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I assume 2@H agrees clubs without 4 spades, so 3@S is not natural, is it?|pg||
nt|toral5: 6@C does have a play.he might play for a vienna coup on north|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i did not notice an alert|pg||
nt|toral5: and as the cards are the roof will fall|pg||
nt|toral5: with @S q IN|pg||
nt|bt: thats a good point, the devious 1@H may lead him wrong|pg||
nt|bt: when south has @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, a losing option|pg||
nt|toral5: and full chances to go wrong cos of THAT super thin 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: after the bidding is best chance the sueeeze when S show @DA - but will Strul play for that?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs don't see the problem in 6@C. There is none if you take a spade finesse, but if you play for North to have @SQ as well as @HK, he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Becker still thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's easy for us to see what's right because we have all 52 cards to look at|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and stil thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hear that Kit Woolsey got it wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He played for the squeeze|pg||
nt|toral5: did kit recieve a 1@H oc?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: ouch|pg||

nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: EW had it all to themselves in that room|pg||
nt|bt: winning imps against robinson, lol|pg||
nt|pelu: on board 25 only 4 out of 8 pairs bid the fine 6@c - not top-standard :(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: this will need some play|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Cayne 14 imps behind after board 25, other Polish (Balicki-Zmudzinski) with Lauria-Versace trying hard|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||
nt|toral5: :(|pg||
nt|bt: some suffer after 1@D-(1@S) when 2@C is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Strul did not play but Helgemo already preapred diamond ace for play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Woolsey opened a Precision 2@C and then North was out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: prepared|pg||
nt|bt: what was explanation of 4NT?|pg||
nt|davidb: entry problem for finessing twice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|swanson: The lack of spade spots meant there was little play and with unfavorable diamond situation this will be down several.|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: This wont look easy from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: do not know|pg||
nt|toral5: 4nt alerted as?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: it was alerted|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: needs 6  trump tricks but  not quite possible|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|rmb1: There are 15 boards per segment, 60 in each match.  This final segment ends with board 30|pg||

nt|jtr: As finesses are taken into him|pg||
pc|h9|nt|swanson: I am told that GIB says it can be made - but GIB has the hand record.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ten of hearts looked like suit preference.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bt: some wise commentators suggested 4@H, that might have simplified things, lol|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jkotor: open cards maybe could won|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|bt: playing for the squeeze in 6@C is antipercentage but if you are down to a good team maybe its good strategy|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: if q will fal......|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|algraves: NS make 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: the cards are going too fast for me and he claims|pg||
nt|swanson: This might be another ten for Nickell - it is easy to imagine that N-S would double a 'save' of 5@C against 4@S.|pg||
nt|rmb1: This should be quick|pg||
nt|kareno: Competing for the partscore. and happy to push e/w up a level.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Greco-Hampson bid a 3NT on a combined 20 count earlier. It was cold|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: I would have thought this was rather dangerous by Hamman  Could neasily run into a double if @ds arent behaving|pg||

pc|h5|nt|algraves: and is pleased|pg||

pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: West has no problem finding 5 discards so this must be 1 down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|algraves: he want to signal diamond thru|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: tx all for watching and see you tomorrow for the semifinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: woow... the speed is now fantastic|pg||
mb|1N|nt|toral5: some fireworks for sure on this last brd|pg||
nt|stoffers: this may be a swingy board yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players are in a hurry|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: opening east hand? anyone?|pg||
nt|ady: last board of the match    well won by Nickell|pg||
nt|kareno: Lastt hand of the set, yes?  Many thanks to our spectacular operator!!  And to the specs for keeping us honest and laughing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not yet|pg||
mb|2S|an|clubs|nt|rmb1: Thanks to David, Traian (op), WBF and USBF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we started with 17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 31 must be the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 brd rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh for the comparisons.  So we have two to go.|pg||
nt|algraves: this is a bad hand type for precision so meckstroth upgrades to a club rather than open a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: women last brd 32 our is 31|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: i would|pg||
nt|bt: and meckwell|pg||
mb|3C|nt|toral5: and versace|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: east was opened a weak NT by those who could, katz passed it|pg||
nt|kareno: How silly |pg||
nt|algraves: Ew can make something |pg||
nt|algraves: so they have to compete for the partscore|pg||
nt|jtr: Gibe Zia 10 hypothetical imps please Traian:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Give|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: where are the fireworks ???? lol|pg||
nt|toral5: LOL:(|pg||
nt|stoffers: Well, not much happened here, as it was tough for HH to find the @d fit|pg||
nt|kittyc: good 4H bid - kep t the oppo out|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: 4@H can make - u can pick up the @C-suit: B to K and A, 9 to 10 and Q and @C5 to finess @c&!|pg||
nt|pelu: @c6|pg||
nt|kittyc: in oher rooms south showed both suits (eg if East bids 2S then South can bid 3D)|pg||
nt|bt: thats to make 5 isnt it|pg||
nt|kareno: 64 is a better number of boards to include all the dealer and vulnerability possibilities|pg||
nt|tlc: dbl T/O|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: around 30 hcp for e/w   but not fitting to well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: yes, 4 is cold|pg||
nt|rmb1: tomorrow for the semifinals ... that's today for those us in Europe (00:53 am)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: usually showing a maximum 1@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves: yes I agree Karen seems silly of WBF to play only 60 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: ok i will|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this should be easy enough|pg||
nt|kareno: In the ACBL we have seen the numbers of boards degraded so swiss matches are now only 6, not a good thing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: from tom we have 16 i think|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is one down at least|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H shortage - maybe both minors- |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: can be no great swing in for this hand    so Woolfson should be through  17 imps ahead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think East thinks that an overtrick or two here is going to win the match |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well he is thinking|pg||
nt|algraves: 3@C would have made undoubtedly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i mean tomorrow we will have 16...last day|pg||
nt|kareno: But session fees have gone UP to compensate for fewer boards :(|pg||
nt|algraves: so east is playing with the houses money as they say|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry that for 11 tricks - but still a nice finess: @c5 , @c6, @c8 to setup @c4!|pg||
nt|bt: so if u get a 2suited overcall makng 5 is easy i guess|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|algraves: so the young israelis played well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kittyc: yes Woolsey made 5 in 5 after 2 suited bid|pg||
nt|toral5: i think 11 makes if he runs @C jack|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|algraves: and this match is a toss up at the half|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|tlc: will be an exciting final 30 bds|pg||
nt|kareno: They surely have.  |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Pachtman-Ginossar were in the team|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2 boards 14 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|passell: fortunate 3nt 2-2 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: penultimate board|pg||
nt|dburn: some chance here also - 3NT didn't have to make, did it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: 2@S= a) invite NT  b) @C|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Meckstroth writes to explain the alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but not game force in @C|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|passell: no  but tough to get right on def|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = max   [accept nt invite]|pg||
nt|passell: yes a very possible swing here|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rosenberg asking Meckstroth a question while Rodwell thinks and Willenken drinks more water|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all that water is affecting ME|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: all that water is effecting me too >:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell says my best guess pd|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on that lead 3N was in trouble|pg||
nt|passell: a good decision  unlikely to let 3nt make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 3@C in trouble on that lead|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't see how it was supposed to make even on the diamond lead it got - declarer has only eight winners|pg||
nt|passell: dia king got cashed at the other table  9th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rosenberg goes into the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 1 = 10 imps  make 3@C = 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: remember, he does not drink the water ;)|pg||
nt|passell: south will be endplayed if he gets a ruff  need dia shift before the ruff|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No good - rise ace and pitch a spade on the @H A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh   if South gets @S ruff -- then endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I thought I saw the Ace @S, but it is late and Rosenberg is far away from me so ????|pg||
nt|passell: yes if he shift he can go up and pitch the spade  nine of clubs is in the right hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|debrose: If North had the club 8 instead of the seven, a diamond shift could beat it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i was just going to mention that   thanks Mike|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|debrose: Meckstroth did not know he could make by pitching spade on heart.  And Rosenberg's falsecard at trick made this impossible for his partner to get right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|vugraphztb: yes Rosenberg did play the Ace of spades on that first trick!|pg||

nt|passell: 5|pg||
nt|debrose: It's been suggested to me that if Rosenberg has played the spade King on the last board they would have won the match|pg||
nt|debrose: Possibly, but also possible Meckstroth would have seen what was coming and played differently|pg||
nt|warrens:  for sure, Meck would have pitched a spade from dummy|pg||
nt|debrose: that's the kind of thing we will never know............|pg||
nt|passell: meck would have played heart ace for sure |pg||
nt|dburn: I think to win, they would need to make twelve tricks here and I don't see how he can do that - but eleven would be a tie and ten a loss|pg||
