nt|vugraphzta: can not see note|pg||
nt|pbundy: good comment that if it were ace asking, north would have already bid|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mamos: this may prove more challenging|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy to stay low enough with these|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy to go minus with NS cards|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H got 10 imps to Fireman, when Eisenberg 3N failed in OR|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mr murray: seems they played n/t on bd 15 so the battle is on.|pg||
nt|othered1: on Board 15|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: oldberg is writing |pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphztb: Goldberg was writing to Gaviard|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mr murray: 6 diamonds is good. now getting to it the problem. easy from our vantage point :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|othered1: This isn't a very friendly lie for NS but it's going to be very tough for south to put on the brakes below 6 (nor,really, should she)|pg||
nt|mamos: undo op|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo operator please|pg||
nt|othered1: On a good day 7 might make, but it's not good enough, on NS cards alone, to bid.|pg||
nt|mr murray: N will take a slightly unwilling preference and smile when it is over|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: thank you pls catch me :)|pg||
nt|dburn: will she? how will six diamonds make?|pg||
nt|mr murray: how not?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Goldberg is deep in thought and the players are motionless|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing beats it|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Sprung writes a note to D'Ovidio|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: she smiles|pg||
nt|mr murray: on a trump lead she needs the spade finess on non trump just ruff 2 diamonds and shed on ak hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: at double dummy, no, but at single dummy you might not take the spade (or the heart) finesse|pg||
nt|mr murray: ruff 2 spades I mean|pg||
nt|mamos: south can hardly stop at three no|pg||
nt|mr murray: all works|pg||
nt|othered1: and what do  you do w ith the last @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: lose it|pg||
nt|mr murray: any reasonable line makes|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dburn: no, it does not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: u r right forgot there is a heart in south hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but I guess we shall see|pg||
nt|mr murray: harder now|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: before the screen is raised, Sprung puts down the dummy|pg||
nt|mr murray: but my guess is she will make it if in it|pg||
nt|dburn: I have a counter-guess, but time will tell|pg||
nt|mr murray: sorry for bad analysis :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Gaviard holds her hand to her forehead and contemplates her lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: passing the lead seems more attractive|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising - she may choose some highish heart, hoping to cut down declarer's options before she sees the trump split|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: but a club is normalish, although she may hate it when she sees dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: This should clarify the position for east and west|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: mightn't @C9 have been better by east to make things less clear to declarer?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I am not sure I played the right card as my orientation is reversed :(|pg||
nt|mr murray: not looking good now for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: still, maybe a heart would have worked better on lead after all|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the club nine was played in fact|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: I cannot see Gaviard's cards|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer will ruff a club, ruff a spade, ruff a club, try to draw trumps, recoil and take the heart finesse|pg||

pc|c3|nt|pbundy: pollack is a fine - but slow player.  she will realize that there isn't much that can be done on this hand.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: good point|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Gaviard looking to her left|pg||
nt|dburn: although maybe West should have played the jack on the second round of spades - the card she was known to hold|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: this is murky now, but whatever declarer does (within reason) will work thanks to the fortunate heart position|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|dburn: since she no longer has an entry to dummy to lose a heart finesse - but if West plays a heart now...|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: is it clear that double is for takeout here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But remember that 1´@D in Polish Club is almost always 5+|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think they have no happy story here|pg||
nt|pbundy: it would not be in my mind - unless 2@C described as natural and non forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So Pollack will be reluctant to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe 2@H then|pg||

nt|dburn: 24, though, was a triumph for French discipline - Gaviard did not open a 4=1=3=5 11 count, and thus did not go down four in 3NT|pg||
