nt|vugraphzsx: sorry, I cant understand the conversation...  |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: should be a straight forward 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: interesting lineup - 4xUS in OR and 4 from Nederland here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: something about distribution and false cards...  |pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|oosmanb: depending on style 1NT or 1@S here |pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: followed by 3NT|pg||

mb|1C|nt|spooky: did he really make +3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: WOW! fun board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes, declare claimed 12 top tricks.. from Jansma... |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|spooky: on this hand you might get to high|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: what's too high?|pg||
nt|spooky: 6 something?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|spooky: I think Sjoert will bid 6@D at some point|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: W asking 7 -5? or just no to partner|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|spooky: only -1 Oos?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: or the Dutch equivalent|pg||
nt|pelu: the @S-finess looks ok - dont know @Ds 4-1 so he can lose to @SK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: as expected!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes I think this is best. ruffing second one with 10 anyway, so you'll be fine|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|spooky: this was a friendly defence at both tables, I don't see a way to 9 tricks without @CAK lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello Gavin|pg||
nt|gavin:  hey|pg||
nt|gavin:  I'm a little biased to the outcome of this match|pg||
nt|gavin:  either way going to be a great finish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So is Gerbrand, so 1-1|pg||
nt|gavin:  my wife is on hampton|pg||
nt|spooky: Ah, luckily we are supporting the same team :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hardly|pg||
nt|gavin:  this hand is very interesting, somehow south has to work out to discourage clubs at trick 1|pg||
nt|gavin:  spade shift at trick 2 is fine to beat this hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now makes with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|spooky: I think it's really hard to convince north about it, she sees Qx in dummy...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gavin:  well if south discourages, it would mean they want spades played|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|gavin:  north can visualize their partner holding kjxx of spades and no jack of clubs|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h8|mc|9|nt|spooky: North knows her partner has at least 4@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  exactly, so if partner discourages clubs, it means they want spades played (they have good spades)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|spooky: I hate to pass with such hands on North after a 1@C opening...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|spooky: 3@C from North now? |pg||
nt|gavin:  or 2@H followed by 3@C|pg||
nt|spooky: they will end in 3@C anyway I guess|pg||
nt|gavin:  Levin has an outrageously strong hand for the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: but she will probably take the opponents serious, they are vulnerable against not|pg||

nt|gavin:  1NT will make it more difficult to reach game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  after north super accepts a transfer, south will have to decide if their hand is worth a raise to game|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|spooky: South has a very balanced hand, I don't think it's enough to bid game..|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Agreed, if only she knew about 5 spades and not 4 opposite|pg||
nt|spooky: I hate opening 1NT with a 5crd Major.. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  Its a very north american mentality to open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|gavin:  we are all brought up to believe its better|pg||
nt|gavin:  understanding this risk of missing some games|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have that debate forever and it won't stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The world is divided, let's accept it|pg||
nt|spooky: the French NS in the other room opened 1@S and south jumped to 4@S directly, so another win for Hampton|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|gavin:  a lot of momentum in this room, they dont know that board 18 was a push|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|gavin:  and board 19 game could have been bid as well|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
mc|10|nt|spooky: this 4@S was down on a @H lead.. a helpfull kib tells me|pg||
nt|gavin:  difficult not to lead JT of diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin:  specially holding AJ doubleton of spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  a good chance you will be able to get in with A@S and score some sort of ruff / overruff with the J|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Director called about 1st board|pg||
nt|spooky: Why?|pg||
nt|spooky: Probably that West took a small pause before bidding 5@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: W thought 2D showed spades. E thought it was natural.|pg||
nt|gavin:  how did it affect the hand ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Dunno|pg||
nt|spooky: that only makes them lucky..|pg||
nt|gavin:  its def a good time to call the director|pg||
nt|spooky: EW were having a good set so far, NS not that good, just break the tempo a bit|pg||
nt|gavin:  match not going so well, might change up the momentum shaking the opps tempo|pg||

nt|oosmanb: this defence couldve cost though if declarer had A@s |pg||

nt|spooky: defence has 4@S 2@D and 1@C already... |pg||
nt|oosmanb: although im playing DD, will paulissen play K@C and @c to 10 and then @H finesse??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or give an open @H trick?|pg||
nt|pelu: but I expect that NS are dorced to give an entry to dummy in @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this can get ugly|pg||
nt|pelu: first NS has to find the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: what to play now in N? @SK? only DD u can play @S5|pg||
nt|spooky: let's say north plays @SK, with this @S's in dummy declarer is almost forced to take the ace|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spooky: @SQ, 2nd/4th through declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|pelu: max down 1 if East play @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant take @D7 - will in a strange way squeeeze dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: this board totally shows that defending is way harder than declarer play, 1Nx= by North on the other table..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen down, more questions by east|pg||

nt|pelu: I have tryed to follow the play in OR - but that dont make sense - sh be down 1 with that play - but prob a mistake by operator in play|pg||
nt|spooky: if Paulissen plays @CK now it will be 8 Imps to Meltzer|pg||

nt|oosmanb: but North can pass this, tempting as it is|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 8 loser hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: North has too many outside losers, lacks of aces should make him pass|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|spooky: can't south have like an outside king?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|oosmanb: K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: Brink like to bid 2@Hs again :)|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess they are set for game now..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: still 2@s 1@D 1@C minimum?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: I dunno just saying|pg||
nt|lml: do you agree with Willard's pass of 1@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@H myself|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: even against a 7 carder it has no chance, so against a 6 carder...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here they bid game either way it seems|pg||
nt|lml: now if Willard had bid 2@H it would have been a touch harder|pg||
pc|h5|nt|spooky: Is the @SA never onside at you oos?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|pelu: ok @SK = the 8. trick in 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|spooky: good double from Paulissen |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H least likely to push opponents (in my view)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: aggresive but will give much needed imps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||

mc|11|nt|lml: so really this is moving along now.  They are a fair bit ahead of the most of the field|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell down 30 and probably out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Break time:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond leading lavazza by 23|pg||
nt|lml: too bad in a way I like watching them.  But then again that keeps fred geoff and the rest in it|pg||
nt|lml: and they are terrific to watch|pg||
nt|lml: I think Nickell lost quite a bit when two team members died, Soloway and Freeman|pg||
nt|lml: Soloway and Hamman had a very good partnership and I dont think Hamman and Zia have quite found their groove|pg||
nt|lml: and Freeman was such a terrific player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very true|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the Diamond team is a fairly new construct and a force to be reckoned with|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: wow Jan probabaly ecstatic at that lead|pg||
nt|lml: once South bid 4@S showing at the very least good spades North was getting to slam... seven may be tricky|pg||
nt|lml: so do you want to be in a grand missing Qxxx of trump?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a 7 you really want to bid, when 6 easy to miss|pg||
nt|lml: I can say this and you can't ... especially in the women's game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in bridge world are grands common after opponents open|pg||
mb|5H|nt|oosmanb: but far from over|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant not easy to bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 33 and you're home |pg||

mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: !!! :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: played a tough 6@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|spooky: Some though boards..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you guys mustve missed that board :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 16 lead I'm told|pg||
nt|spooky: 16 all helpfull kibs tell me|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 131-106 25?|pg||
nt|spooky: 1NT wouldn't be my choice|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh that's through 10 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, it's 11 from O'Rourke and 11 to Meltzer, so 131-115|pg||
nt|spooky: Thanks Warren :)|pg||
nt|lml: did they really make 12 tricks operator?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosmanb: I'm surprised that this 4@S actually made at one table|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 4@D is the max at this board, but they might sac again against the game|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H is @S's|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H=transfer to @S's here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was played by W as here, the lead was @s to the king and a @s came back..........|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
mb|3D|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: So 35 unanswered imps with one possible plus to come in for Joel|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Ok, a couple of kibz confirmed, THANK you,|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it was a 1 NT opening|pg||

pc|h4|nt|oosmanb: could brink shift to a @C after he gets @S ?|pg||
nt|spooky: why would he? |pg||
nt|oosmanb: would the Q@H there have been @D Spooky? instead of 9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he bid diamonds twice right|pg||
nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: plus the @D bids ..|pg||
nt|spooky: the only chance for West is the @SK onside, if South ducks it once, he might end going -2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: south will duck|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||

nt|lml: the normal ways to play this hand seem to lead to 1 down to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I once played a match up 13 with two boards to go, thought my opponents might be able to win it (based on my last two results).  they didn't play the last 2 boards well and got penalized for slow play, so we won by over 40.  penalties can swing |pg||
nt|lml: especially on a club lead|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: easy contract|pg||
