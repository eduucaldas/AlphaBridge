nt|vugraphzsx: there was a director call on the 3S bid we may need to adjust the last board. |pg||

nt|stc: very, very low scoring segment with very good play (was to expect !)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: matter of partnership style what you do on 6/6 hands like that - opening a two-suiter and rebidding at the 5-level may seem extreme, but who knows? |pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: there was a contested auction .. with an unusual jump to 3S.. south believes he was misinformed about he meaning of the 3S bid when he asked about it. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h has no chance, mirror @S and @C, nothing to be done in @D (and no entries anyway)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Can kibitzers help me here, any reports on anyone bidding 3NT here? |pg||

nt|uni_cicam: showing 15-17 balanced now|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: 3@C and 3NT will come|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: yes, but 3@C is a check back|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|oosmanb: 2@H was by South probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and as expected they land in 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes 2H was south|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 2NT could have been a strong hand with solid S suit also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milan - what would Kurka open with 4@S333 and 15-17 points?|pg||
nt|othered1: Really, 4@S is a very good spot, that couldn't be found after 1N opening, at least not with other room's methods.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many Precision players say 1@H is forcing -- not sure if it was here|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 3NT just balanced 15-17. 2NT can be even 18-20|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzsx: if I try to correct it though you may miss the whole board.. sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: failure to bid 2@C suggests 1@H could have been 4@H with longer @C/@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: No need April thanks you're doing a fantastic job!|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: dbl can help, but @C lead is still obvious, will Kopecky guess right?|pg||

nt|othered1: That's the winner once past 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: if they can stay there|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: needs a bit too much for 15-17 for a slam|pg||
mb|5D|nt|oosmanb: Since this is such an important match, declarer will try a pseudo squeeze and try to ruff two @D for a miracle|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very tough hand |pg||
nt|othered1: if south's @SQ were the @CK slam isn't bad at all.|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Hi Taymour welcome|pg||

pc|cK|nt|uni_cicam: true, but 3NT might be a warning bid, anyway here we go|pg||
nt|othered1: Will be faced with same position Hamman misguessed|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: tough decision|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oosmanb: I'm curious, can kibitzers send me a personal message whether they'd play this deal all the way through or just claim -1 and move on|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|timmy5: ill play :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm told 3NT was bid by Pharmaservice, Thank you Mh. Shaker :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: As I was saying, for us mere mortals 3NT seems hard to find, but at this level all 32 teams ARE capable of finding the 9 trick cold game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I had pharmaservices this morning.  a very nice pair from Denmark...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: and it has to be N who needs to convince South (due to the 4333 and AA Kxx @H)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|uni_cicam: but, if they try to get a ruff, probably they have it|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uni_cicam: this will take a while|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: taking by A is winning also againt 4th @D J on side|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: so yes, they might|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: play the Ace Michal, please :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think this is anything other than a guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck would play the same regardless of who holds the @DJ   and maybe even with @C33|pg||
