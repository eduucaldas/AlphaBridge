mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S play Acol (4-card majors) with a 12-14 NT in all positions|pg||
nt|Zmud99: there's some adds every 15 mns during 15s I think but it's free so...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other vugraph tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   but wear a seatbelt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson: N-S would be too high at the five level should East find the aggressive @DK lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bilde unable to rebid 1NT as that would show 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hence the 3-card 2@C |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but 2@S?    i suppose 2@C had to confirm 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: He can hardly bid 2NT with no diamond stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what else but 2@S is there after 4th suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same for N-S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|swanson: Sometimes one has to fight the impulse to be spectacular at the table doing such things as leading unsupported honors, but here the @DK is a standout on the auction.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|mc|12|nt|swanson: I wonder what the thought process was for the spade shift.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought declarer had a stiff diamond I suppose, but still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blame the caddy for giving him wrong yardage?    no wait, that was last weekend ryder cup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought USA had forgot that already :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forgotten even|pg||
nt|swanson: The safer 3NT game was reached at the other table - a good effort with an 8-card major fit and a singleton.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: That seems right. He is discussing with the director|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the truth is out -- i'm a Golf fan, not a  USA golf fan|pg||
nt|Zmud99: you can watch live action on http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  !!!|pg||
nt|swanson: First time I ever watched a golf match played underwater.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see what Piekareks problem is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer could surely be 2524 on the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had not guaranteed a stiff diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: As you said, he thought declarer had 1 diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but that is his problem, not declarer's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you bid a 2542 hand without a diamond stopper?|pg||
nt|phil: not an unreasonable inference but where is he getting his tricks is that is the case? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that @D2 showed an even number, so either 4 or 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Piekarek thought it was 6 apparently, so what?|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: EW play Baltic Club   1@H shows 11-18 HCP|pg||
nt|swanson: Really, the diamond play by West should be suit preference (in case partner was leading a singleton).  East will know partner holds the ace when the king holds.|pg||
nt|phil: hmm - I would take it as count in that instance with strong spades in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i read correctly  3@D shows splinter in @S|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: It is unusual to splinter in support (of likely a 5-card suit) with three weak trumps.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: but i thought original Gladiator  the slow auction was weak   it's been a long long time|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@S is a little touchy - declarer has to manage two losing clubs even with the @CA onside.  THe danger is an early trump finesse and E-W clear dummy's trumps.  THe diamond lead ...|pg||

nt|swanson: 4@S will make if declarer guesses to avoid a spade loser. |pg||
nt|phil: 3@d for the lead - some more aggressive action than 2N would have shut out the lead director|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|phil: although leading the @hK would lead to the same rresult|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Josef And Cards currrently in 2nd    Team Pharmaservice in 3rd    for Group H|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|swanson: I don't know what 3@H shows, but any call other than pass by North over 3@D looks like a big overbid to me.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wonder if 2N was any @S raise or  a transfer to @C|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|phil: can he get it right with a partial count? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: since Bilde took a call  2N must have been @S raise, so 3@H said something about accept/reject depending upoon south's possible strengths|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson: Considering the spade suit alone, the percentage play is to finesse after East plays an honor on the first round.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil: but without the diamond lead declarer has other options|pg||

nt|phil: even if they are 3-1 onside, the hand is practically cold anyway|pg||

nt|swanson: Using a four level cue bid as choice of games (rather than a slam try) when there has been no suit agreement is a new idea which has a lot of merit.|pg||
