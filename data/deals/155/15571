nt|athene: not sure why he played the clubs that way|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|mb|r!|an|shows 2 spades|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: btw Martens 88 Nickell 71|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: 2nt is natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell inquires further about the 1 nt bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: So Nickell have closed the gap a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have music Greco says, as a piano plays in the background|pg||
nt|kareno: North happy to be able to pass!!|pg||
nt|sommer: difficult but makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: this makes it easier|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: I like the overcall folks.  You must get your good suits into the auction when it's safe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa leaves to quiet the piano player|pg||
nt|kareno: I heard that Rodwell is still playing so he's innocent :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: trying an intra-finesse in spades, playing east for @S10x/@S9x|pg||
nt|athene: now a club through, trying to get west off some endplay|pg||
nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will lead the @SJ from dummy next time he plays the suit, holding his losers to two|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||
nt|athene: sorry out of his spade spots|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd silently counts to himself|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: now @HQ to king and ace, and @SJ, maybe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sommer: is it over?|pg||
nt|bessi2: he can now.. play a heart to the jack ruff diamond and exit in spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no cards were played while we were offline :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahhh:)|pg||
nt|athene: if he views to drop the @H10 offside he can even unblock his @H8 and finesse the six :) as a kibitzer points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still has not played a card :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can you remake the score, Ala?|pg||
nt|bessi2: the 10 of hearts doesnt need to drop.. west will be endplayed in spades.. he knows he has the king|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure his nice intra-finesse play actually got him anything because if he gets forced in diamonds it doesn't matter whether he ruffs with a small spade or a boss spade|pg||

nt|toral5: we r heading for a super exciting last set|pg||
nt|athene: certainly east had to lead a club when in to give the defence a chance|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: a pity we lost the play there|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I don't like it|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. I wonder how he played it|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|toral5: 4@H depends on the opening lead by greco|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks to our excellent operator for a job well done.  Keeps us informed on bids, plays and knee jiggles too :)  I love how you bring the room to life for us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of pointing and writing|pg||
nt|toral5: 12 imps at stake here only on the opening lead|pg||
nt|sommer: tough to bid 2@S now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell says he should have taken the intrafinesse in spades instead of hearts perhaps?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but good!|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S now?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sommer: done:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I thought S may get excited:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|caitlin: that's it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: killing lead|pg||
nt|toral5: beautiful lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow, found the diamond!! For the push.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|bessi2: many play this sequence as showing a better hand.. raising to 2@s immediately with that hand.. but they clearly dont play it that way|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Yes, I'm sure she has nice, expensive knees :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|toral5: sadek had an easy lead at the other table cos walid dbled 3@D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|toral5: but wel done greco here for sure|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know how you find a diamond vs a spade.  But apparently it happens - I'd say it's a 50-50 lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco laughs and says he lead well|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||

nt|athene: are these 14-board segments?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth was glad his pd had a minimum :)|pg||
nt|sommer: guess so, yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: i'm told 15|pg||
nt|sommer: 56 in total|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, they play 4x14 bfs|pg||
nt|gulyas: bds, sry|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 15 (60)|pg||
nt|athene: why not 16? 16 is a nice number - it's a power of two!|pg||
nt|athene: 14 and 15 - well, they aren't a power of anything|pg||
nt|sommer: 15 it is ..60|pg||
nt|gulyas: it has something to do with WBF policy, how many bds a player can be forced to play on a given day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all sessions before this were 14 boards in the Rosenblum, but yesterday they played 15 boards in the McConnel|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Last hand of the set.|pg||
nt|toral5: karen u mind listening to a silly theory?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kareno: I'm told in Nickell match both tables found @d lead without a clue|pg||
nt|toral5: its actually silly,but belladonna said this in his interview:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone have the video link?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco first alerted the diamond and then waved it off after seeubg the 1 @C opening|pg||
nt|caitlin: When are we back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No more video today; tomorrow|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: No 'we.'  I won't be back today.  Sorry :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I think 56 is the magic number|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|kareno: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|toral5: beladonna told in his interview to eric jannersten:whn u hold 2 EQUAL suits,add up the suits.and lead the suit with HIGHER total.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|gulyas: it all started in Beijing 2008|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: He was a fabulous player.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa scratches his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: 4@c will not excite Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: 1NT is 15-17...|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with upgrade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: as do I|pg||
nt|sommer: E's hand is more 16 than 14|pg||
nt|athene: this won't take too long|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson was caught red handed and everyone laughs|pg||
mc|10|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has 3 trumps, an A, and a possible ruff, not a bad hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sommer: now..a @C?|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first trick might have been wise if the lead was a doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: oh no.. this is still making since he played a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: odwell leads high from a singleton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: <meckstroth agrees <<<|pg||
nt|athene: he wants to set up a club trick using the trumps and @DA as entry|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c8|nt|bessi2: he is on his way down it seems|pg||
nt|athene: he surely didn't duck this queen|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, this was not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson goes hmm on the drop of the spade queen|pg||
nt|athene: he led to the @DA and played a heart up|pg||
nt|sommer: @C3 would work!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sommer: wow..the @C3:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sommer: he can claim now:)|pg||
nt|athene: he is planning to draw trumps ending in dummy and just lead the @C7|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson talking to Meckstroth and chuckling|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he gets lucky even with @Cs 5-1:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Robinson shows his hand|pg||
nt|athene: meckstroth could have returned a small club after winning the queen, but it wouldn't have helped|pg||
mc|10|nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|athene: decalrer could just ruff high, draw trumps, and set up the club|pg||
nt|athene: dummy's club spots and @S8 are nice cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: the players have left and bye for now >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|sommer: guess this was the last...tnx all:)..tnx kibz for your remarcs|pg||
nt|gulyas: tx all - sry abt the score, but the connection was lost, and running scores are down, too|pg||
nt|gulyas: Nickell was up by abt 25 the last time we knew|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but we can say Nickel leads "a bit"|pg||
nt|sommer: 25-6 it was|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was 31-6 at some point|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hear that Zia went down in the same 4@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the lead is more now|pg||
nt|gulyas: making a wild guess: Nickell up by at least 35|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, more news: Zia made the 4@S, but the score maybe 39-6|pg||
