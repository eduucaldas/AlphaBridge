nt|ybob: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|3for3: good morning from Philadelphia|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: he may have wished he didnt come in.|pg||
nt|athene: double probably something like meckwell - one minor or both majors?|pg||
nt|rado: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ybob: easy tricks with a friendly @C |pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: a @D-ruff = down 1 - but a nice contract|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C pass or correct, 2@H =majors|pg||
nt|mr murray: that is how meckwell would bid if he would bid at all. guess when coming from behind no time to be a coward|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: 2@H is down 1 at least|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|3for3: assuming rdbl showed some values, that is alot of bidding opposite a non vulnerable overcall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: east obviously doesn't think double is penalties|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mr murray: usually in expert partnerships first dbl is t/0|pg||
nt|rado: defense should collect all top tricks and try @C promotion for 3 trumps|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztb: Katz asks about the lead and receives a response of 4th|pg||
nt|athene: he can try a spade towards dummy for a possible overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: and will be rewarded|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice try by W|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: @D4 = asking for @H = low suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|athene: not too much interest here; there might be an imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|3for3: north sensibly doesnt try for ruffs himself|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: obviosly they play after 1/  bid, reverses show no extras|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: yes we are playing this slowly|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|athene: running the diamonds first isn't a bad idea, although you won't expect them to throw spades away (assuming 2@S was actually natural)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Hi Folks  :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ybob: declarer lost the trump control to down 2 now|pg||
nt|rado: other table movie http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Chiu deep in thought|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|han: with 24 HCP combined, some EW will probably get to 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N EW might be interesting...|pg||
nt|han: I think after 2NT, west should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|han: 13 HCP but 3 aces and very good spot cards (10's and 9's)|pg||
nt|xenya: W will eaise, yes|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|han: a good chance to pick up IMPs for Argentina... or to lose IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: cards are quite friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|han: declarer will likely duck this trick, Nunes won't be able to continue clubs that way|pg||
nt|han: Notice that Helness, in the other room, only bid 1NT with the east hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: but if E ducks and Nunes finds a @H switch...|pg||
nt|han: they can probably open quite light in third seat, white against red|pg||
nt|han: I think Nunes will switch to a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes in the tank now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|han: it's the most attractive suit to switch to|pg||
nt|han: spades is clearly out|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|han: and diamonds... declarer denied a 4-card major so he probably has some diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: well done -- these guys seldom make mistakes when defending|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: now a @H continuation obviously beats it|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: first blood to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|han: now Fantoni just has to hold on to his diamond king and heart jack, and south only has to guard the clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni can see 5 tricks now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||

nt|henryb:  Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: someone will end in 3NT here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Peter :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphztb: Katz writing to explain the 2NT alert|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like a normal and fairly straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps all 64 tables will reach 3NT on these cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either someone is legitimately squeezed or they throw the wrong thing anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell explaining the 4 @D alert|pg||
nt|athene: N-S obviously play a double of stayman simply says "i would have doubled 1nt"|pg||
nt|caitlin: probably puppet?|pg||
nt|athene: is 2@C a positive in diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: i will try and hunt out the NS convention card|pg||
nt|ybob: 110 in 2@C ? probably push hand at board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a reasonable way to play, especially when people bid stayman on nothing|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing less than 3 hearts or might just bid the game|pg||
nt|athene: i know that @S vs. @H auctions tend to end in 4@S but it looks a bit over the top here for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: a nt partial for most...unless you are meckwell, then an easy game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bocchi Ferraro? i doubt you can find that|pg||
nt|3for3: helness sensibly does not invite opposite 3d chair 1@D|pg||
nt|ybob: q@C lead ...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: west can see that if he passes 1nt, north is sure to double, and now NS are far better-placed |pg||
nt|athene: if you start with stayman, sometimes your opponents have trouble working out they have the whole deck themselves|pg||
nt|3for3: i'd lead a low club.  length surely on your right.  if a club at all|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks the meaning of his bid, to confirm that it is a limit raise or better|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: last hand it was west who had @CKQJ bare|pg||
nt|athene: it helps in the play of 3nt if you know that will be the case every hand :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not this one though  :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nhas yet to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|athene: sementa is wondering if he ought to pass his - he will wonder for a while and then bid 3nt, i would imagine|pg||
nt|caitlin: N has yet to|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting what south can have for this bid, given that he didn't pass the double|pg||
nt|athene: i guess no-one wants to get cute hoping for 4@H-1 against 4@S-1 so they just avoid the whole dilemma|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i don't think clubs can be his best suit - he would surely pass the double then|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 21 I would GO|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they registered it with ecats for this event - but not many did so i am not overflowing with confidence|pg||
nt|athene: anyway it looks like strong club, 2@C = diamonds, rest honest-as-the-day-is-long|pg||
nt|hedyg: Anna has not yet posted the CCs of this event|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C in Bocchi - Madala system is two-way (1) GF or (2) club raise|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: when 2 passed back to south he pointed down|pg||
nt|ybob: best start to NS here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: surely N should at least correct to 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but Bocchi/Madala do not play a strong @c system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: sementa decides that 2nt showed his hand and hence he has to pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ala|pg||
nt|petergill: Bocchi regards himself as a system designer, so these two probably play much the same|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that of the unbid suits, bramley chooses @CJxx rather than @S8xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the Bocchi -Madala system S would not have opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps reasoning that he is more likely to find his partner with four or five decent clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n s nt 12 15|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ybob: return @C was better|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but with a weakish hand and 5+ clubs surely south was passing the double of 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: underleading the ace allows south to play more trumps later if that looks right but it retains control so he will get the lead to cash out if necessary (e.g. if the clubs look ...|pg||
nt|athene: threatening)|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has too much fire power though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mr murray: nothing matters|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: we will not win land speed records here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrt2000: correct|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|reisig: and with weak  4-4?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: when a person bids stayman with a very weak hand he usually has short (shortish) clubs as he is going to pass any rebid by opener, so south would know his clubs were over east's|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: yes strong @c and weak NT here|pg||
nt|athene: quite often when you are trying to find partner's suit, it's better to go for a minor than a major because partner would have overcalled with the major but not with the minor|pg||
nt|mr murray: he should not touch diamonds here as hand still goes bait if N and E diamond hoinors arereversed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ybob: return @C win 1 tempo to NS , now easy |pg||
nt|rado: now 9 tricks maybe:)|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: with weak 4-4 you just bid 2@H then pass 2nt, surely|pg||

nt|athene: a spec asks a question which i was wondering - it looks as though there is some mixup with the labelling of the teams|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley is playing on team bramley, not team lavazza?|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps a lead of the 6 of hearts might have made the need for a switch more obvious|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S forEW|pg||
nt|ybob: they lead 2/4th in NT , i think |pg||
nt|3for3: 5@C save for NS|pg||

nt|rado: cheap:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mrt2000: will they get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|petergill: The Open Room of this match also has the team names not matching the players who are seated|pg||
nt|3for3: the 2+ 1@C hurt NS here.  North was afraid to raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: Bocchi likes trying out new things - i know when he played with Duboin they changed their system from time to time, not because it was getting bad results but because Bocchi got ...|pg||
nt|athene: bored and wanted to try something different|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrt2000: may do so now|pg||
nt|athene: this 2@H opener is definitely a bit different|pg||
mb|5C|nt|3for3: Helness 2@C lets South double, and now the save is found...|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrt2000: will do so!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Yeung now in a spot for having responded 1@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|athene: well, hearts is the unbid suit, i guess|pg||
nt|gluckenval: sta inciuciando con te ? lolllll.... mica gli ho detto che sei una ragazza impegnata... forse dovevo ? :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: the teamnames are reversed on the scoreboard :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s pointed down when bid 2 h|pg||
nt|athene: but to lead a heart from Qx does mean you have to play partner for the absolute outer limits of what he can have and not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 11-15 both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S natural and forcing, I think|pg||
nt|3for3: even if partner can have only 2@C, I think North needs to act with a void the first round|pg||
nt|ybob: i think down 2, because are humans :)|pg||
nt|ybob: OR playing 3nt, down 1 in last board|pg||
pc|c4|nt|3for3: so HH conservative approach wins them the first swing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphztb: Yeung scratching his head, not knowing how many times he needs to rebid his 3 points|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asking for a review of the bidding before he leads|pg||
nt|athene: of course this is trivial with 2-2 trumps but declarer will be thinking about worse breaks|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v true|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you cashed two hearts and the queen didn't fall, you would be badly placed|pg||
nt|3for3: .|pg||
nt|3for3: might he need to rise to play trumps?  seems unlikely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: as you are going to lose the lead in clubs or diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: and the defender with the @HQ might cash it and leave you very short of tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: He explains he was daydreaming|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|athene: so you might duck a diamond first perhaps|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: how would 5@C fare?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: the club switch was good for the defence - now declarer can't take advantage of 3-3 diamonds to get a club away from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: which might be a very useful play if it turned out someone had an annoying @HQxx|pg||
nt|reisig: Any bets on the result?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can possibly go down with @HQx with west|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 4|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bet -50|pg||
nt|caitlin: making|pg||
nt|athene: you think the defence have been deceptive in clubs?|pg||
nt|reisig: Yup|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer will place west with three clubs|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible the small club switch from @CQx might muddy the waters|pg||
nt|athene: if think they will find a heart lead you might prefer to try 5@C|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this looks slightly worrying|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: in the other room surely it's going to go 1@D - @S and east will get a chance to bid 2@H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|caitlin: yessssssss|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|3for3: all road lead to -3 at this point, so 3 imps to Camberos, but could have been more|pg||
pc|d4|nt|reisig: Have I EVER been wrong?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: in the other room they didn't get the early club shift so i assume declarer indeed got his club pitch on the diamond|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|3for3: In OR, South for Zimmerman opened 1NT, so no save was found there...|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: cannot miss a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|xenya: ecactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 2c was game force|pg||
nt|han: and a heart lead looks quite normal|pg||

nt|han: now declarer can take 4 heart tricks|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|han: even without you probably meant|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: Slawinski(or is it y?)|pg||
nt|han: west's spade suit is quite good with the 9 in front of the 1087|pg||
nt|han: here they write Slavinsky|pg||
nt|hedyg: an odd card is from an even nr of cards with an honour or from an odd nr of cards without an honour|pg||

nt|hedyg: or S³awiñski :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and still counting.... probably hard to see the magic 9|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 imps on 3 to Camberos when they found the 5@C sacrifice in the other room |pg||
nt|han: well he just threw a heart trick|pg||
nt|han: but he can take the diamond finesse so no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: still thinking...|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C is only 2 off on that hand, but declarer found a way to go down 3|pg||

nt|athene: declarer was playing west for 6-1-3-3|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: he had shown hearts and spades so west decided this was a good shot|pg||
nt|3for3: a misfit that looks like it will end in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even 1@D and 1@S from West -Pas - 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: he also picked the trumps though and ducked to the bare ace first time|pg||
nt|ybob: friendly 9@S in S to win 3NT to EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: in which case with diamonds 3-3 he only needs one ruff anyway so he can cater for 3-1 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes west might bid 1 or 2@S|pg||
nt|rado: or 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: mad.....new laptop frozen board|pg||
nt|petergill: William is right , with the 1@S bid at the other table being by West, North passing and east bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: that's sort of unlucky - because often in that situation you are forced to play for 2-2 trumps as you need two ruffs anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S, to describe the 5-4 shape, or Dbl to describe the strong hand?|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|ybob: win 3NT here if N lead |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztb: 3@H appears to be Smolen|pg||
nt|dkgrab: RR never wrong   :)|pg||
nt|hussein2: Hi William|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|reisig: Thx David :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl does seem best - can always bid 2@s over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 1nt is typically t/o of hearts but east is so strong, he thinks he can handle the auction|pg||
nt|athene: some play this sequence as constructive, so they have to just transfer to spades (as in the other room)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hussein2: EW plays this as 5/8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ybob: 8@D lead win too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Yes. Game force with 5 spades and 4 hearts. Had the major lengths been the other way, bids 3S|pg||
nt|01molaire: ý  believe  missclick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|01molaire: he   can    make   it|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players have requested that I not click on the bid until the board is passed under the screen and I sometimes miss passes.  Pls keep me on my toes-lol|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer likely weighing his plan|pg||
nt|hussein2: Ahmady might bid something|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@S is constructive, east has a game bid with all those major-suit cards and a side ace|pg||
nt|mr murray: thats y that auction seems wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i am still not convinced declarer played it very well|pg||
nt|athene: wouldn't west have a weak-2 opener if he had that hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: all plyer thanking each other|pg||
nt|hussein2: Agree -- looking at Qxxxx Axxx 10 tricks are very possible|pg||
pc|c3|nt|reisig: For this hand ...get some ice -- have a drink :)|pg||
nt|athene: several kibitzers are suggesting that ducking the first spade might have been a better move, tactically - indeed that's what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: I predict 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: by covering the spade you force west to switch|pg||
nt|petergill: The play is very interesting|pg||
pc|c4|nt|caitlin: 51S aT |pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: W thinking|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@S  at jeast]|pg||
nt|athene: west can't really be contemplating sticking the eight in can he?|pg||
nt|caitlin: at least 1@H  4@C  1@D|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly this @H5 lead has probably confused everyone :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Well ..he's tring find ANY other chance to beat this|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that it's west who has pushed it here, not east - so 2@S ought to be a bit more than west has|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he doesnt take the safe transfer to spades then it seems he should bid crawling stayman p or c|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|01molaire: yes  |pg||
nt|peachy: how do they know, do they hear a click?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Because of a small technical problem that I can't fix - names of each teams on your score is reverse : Bramley is LAvazza and Lavazza is Bramley - sorry for this  |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players were adament that they can hear the clicking, but when they fondle their bidding boxes, the cards make noise|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: still, I will honor their request not to input the bids until the board is passed through|pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence switches to @d's, East might pitch @HJ on a @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Hervé|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Nunes alerted 2h from Fantoni|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: so should have the last 2 and they cost Zimmermann 12 imps|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|othered1: should be game force with @C, or balanced, or @D support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: this looks strange|pg||
nt|othered1: this isn't exactly a great illustration of the system, missing major suit game|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: strange but real...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: have they not located the spade fit?|pg||
nt|othered1: but t hings are very friendly|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely Nunes could have bid @s over 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: could not bid 1@s since that is limited to 9 hcps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had to set the gf 1st with 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni will make this...but likely to loose 2 imps on the board|pg||
nt|othered1: There is lots of artificiality in their auctions' development.  Perhaps 2@S would not have been natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will tyr to find something on Dan Neill's site|pg||
nt|othered1: A Fantunes card, perhaps not up-to-the-minute:  http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 4s in the closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so preasure here and he knows it ....|pg||
nt|xenya: well, 5@D is not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: absolutely not|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment..|pg||
nt|xenya: which makes it even more interesting to watch|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he knows for sure closed room will play in spades|pg||
nt|han: It's a very difficult hand|pg||
nt|han: here he can make it easily because diamonds and spades both split 3-2 and the person with short diamonds also has short spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Fantunes' style has them dancing on the edge pretty often, but they don't seem to wear themselves down.  Other pairs mightn't have the fortitude to handle all of that.|pg||
nt|han: he can win in hand, ruff two clubs in hand while pulling on more round of trumps with the high trump in hand|pg||
nt|han: and enter dummy twice in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni still thinking|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|han: well, it is clear|pg||
nt|han: because if he plays spades spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty clear to us, not to him|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|han: if he plays heart ace heart queen*|pg||

nt|han: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: wow..|pg||
nt|han: playing spades gained nothing|pg||
nt|han: and playing the queen of hearts can't lose when you think about it and will often gain as only one defender can win that trick|pg||
nt|han: so lose only two tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a good, but known play|pg||
nt|han: two IMPs I meant|pg||
nt|othered1: or both :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director here complaining about time|pg||

nt|petergill: South bid 1@C, not East|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 3nt easier than 4@S here - often the way with a 4333 facing a 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: notice that Bocchi can't open a weak-2@H because they use that for a cunning both-minors bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: yes Bill i checked the movie again and he had 8 tricks for 2@s= last board|pg||
nt|athene: multiply the auction by the square root of -1 and try again|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S and possible 5@C|pg||

nt|rado: or more|pg||
mb|3C|nt|3for3: not likely EW will save, no one has shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@C from south, not east, operator?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: ????|pg||
nt|hedyg: Ala is this correct?|pg||
nt|athene: it's exactly 90 degrees off correct|pg||
nt|athene: west got a little luck in the other room to strike a 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Conservative pass of the weak jump by Guido Ferraro, vul at imps. |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H "semi positive", showing the weak-2 he wanted to open first time :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Norberto Bocchi has a very good hand for his weak jump|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c is 16+|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess 1@d would be weak |pg||
nt|athene: at any other vulnerability, lacking a weak-2@H, i think people would open that north hand 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: missed 1st two tricks |pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly be a bit worried about bidding 2@H facing a strong club - you have a pretty good hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: Could well be jitters, playing on vugraph and knowing how formidable the opposing team is|pg||
nt|peachy: formidable, in the best of sense of course|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz says that the auction 1C p 1D p 1 NT he might have 4 of a major|pg||
nt|pelu: np 11 tricks for NS (or 12)|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxxxx  and out from North being enough for a fair vulnerable game at imps, South could have done more. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: will be an easy 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: nine easy tricks once he knocks out the spade - will he get something going against west in the minor suits to make more?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 10 I will change it later|pg||
nt|hussein2: nice shift|pg||
nt|athene: with 4hcp facing a strong notrump i would have thought pass was the normal action - it's not that you are really scared of playing 1nt|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|peachy: declarer has nice spot cards in all non-club suits, so again no imminent danger in any suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|mr murray: he did but this is goingto turn out oik on the spade lead|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to play spades before diamonds, to protect the @HAQ, i think|pg||
nt|hussein2: but @d produces 4 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: Thank you operator. THat is a common style in the US, where 2/1 is rather prominent as system. Opener could even have both 4-card majors for 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|peachy: Even when not playing 2/1, some play that opening 1C and next bidding a major guarantees 4+ clubs.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ybob: OR playing 5@D so 2 points  to Camberos |pg||
pc|c6|nt|hussein2: also N might play @c after winning @d ace|pg||
pc|c8|nt|reisig: 4@s might fail...if that's the contract|pg||
nt|athene: well, now he *could* make an overtrick by ducking a club then cashing the @CA and playing @SA, spade to endplay east|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why he should do any of those things|pg||
nt|3for3: game easy with all suits breaking well, but camberos doesnt know that yet|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests that it would have been better to start the spades leading the ten from hand - but that won't look so clever if west has the singleton king|pg||
nt|hussein2: he can make now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play low @S to J|pg||
nt|ybob: not @C ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|athene: just nine tricks will do nicely|pg||
nt|athene: in fact when you play 3nt with a 5-3 major fit you WANT to make nine tricks rather than ten|pg||
nt|athene: because then there is more likelihood you get a game swing|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hussein2: timing was managed nicely|pg||

nt|athene: it means your partner is much better-placed|pg||
nt|athene: whether that is worth giving up a natural 3@C overcall is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: there are many top pairs who feel it isn't|pg||
nt|caitlin: here yes, typically not so|pg||
nt|athene: it's all very well doubling these artificial overcalls to show "cards" or even "a penalty double of one of their suits"|pg||
nt|athene: but you have to discuss follow-ups|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: S thinking|pg||
nt|athene: in particular, is pass forcing, and what does double mean?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same as w ubusual NT but not NICHAELS|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bid 3@s over 3@c --- get it off my chest|pg||
nt|caitlin: xx is card showing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S limited opener, playing strong club system|pg||
nt|anton72: just for the records ...... who leading now..... in small table Bramley 12 ( Dark Blue color ) ....where is a player names with Dark Blue are colored Lavazza,s players ..... so ...|pg||
nt|anton72: ...Which team really lead now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|3for3: 5@C|pg||
nt|3for3: -5@H-7@D|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|athene: south must have been really really nervous doubling there, since he has NO defence|pg||
nt|caitlin: E habd?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he isn't a nervous fellow though|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, 1 prediction down :(|pg||
mb|4N|nt|peachy: a relaxing partscore, not a whole lot to think about|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control, with @D's agreed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|3 keys|nt|pelu: 3NT can make on a @H-finess - but 5@D is the place to be|pg||

mb|p|mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: yes 5@D cold E-W|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: heart now and a happy defensive crossruff ensues|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes we announced that|pg||
nt|hedyg: the teamnames are reversed , the seating is correct|pg||
nt|petergill: Lavazza leads 12-0, but Bramley will most likely gain 10 imps when Bd 5 has been played at the other table|pg||

mb|2H|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c gf, natural or balanced or fit|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the game force with support hand.  When partner implies at least 14 HCP, a flat 10 with support is enough, at least for them|pg||

nt|athene: even if they didn't cash their club you can't get all your clubs away on spades|pg||
nt|3for3: at least the prediction of 7@D came off without a hitch|pg||
nt|rado: quiet 4@S now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: and you aren't going to risk the heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: might be tempted to try 3nt|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: (more of a concern at MP, admittedly)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C obviously a strong spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: As the Running Score in our match is recorded wrongly (perhaps all 8 players sat int he wrong seats?), it is possible that Running Scores in some other matches might also be back ...|pg||
nt|petergill: to front|pg||
nt|athene: another non-weak-2....the last one was costly|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@C transfer, same in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: no alert on pass sorry |pg||
nt|athene: now NS will go into their little dance and emerge at the other end in 6@S, we assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@HX looks like minus 800, worth missing out on. |pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: Hervé checked and the seating is correct, the screboard is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: scoreboard|pg||
nt|3for3: notice the red suit symmetries|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now 2@S looks normal from west|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: but in the other room he passed 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe he was a bit worried north had a spade stack over him - certainly possible on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: although it isn't a penalty pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: E 2D artificial, though he happensa to also have diamonds.  It is either 4th suit, or a checkback bid, depending on system]|pg||
nt|mr murray: If wrong seated someone will catch hell :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: @SJ lead in the other room talked declarer out of the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that was a sneaky thing to do|pg||
nt|petergill: and without the weak 2@H, North will lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is artificial showing a 6-4, with 3@C asking?|pg||
nt|petergill: if EW end in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe 2nt is any game force|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: w thinking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: 4NT invites slam, and with a six-card suit, E is happy to oblige (I would, anyway...right ot wrong)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz is pondering his response|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz sneezed, we said bless you, and now he starts his thinking over again|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung is asking about the 4 NT bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: i'm told 3@D has shown 6@S-4@D, which seems logical|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S, a spade to the queen picks up Jx in South, whereas a spade to the queen does not pick up Kx in south, so low to queen is best. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: a spade to the ten doesn't work against @SKx with south, yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: favorable club lie, hearts run, and NT also right sided.  Not a really cold one, but I think I would accept|pg||
nt|petergill: West has no club stopper, so they are headed for 4@s or 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: unless you can get a trump coup going|pg||
nt|mr murray: very well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphztb: Katz tells Nickell that he will probably make 7|pg||
nt|athene: but for a trump coup you need lots of dummy entries which usually is hard with a 4-count|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I forgot there was no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: especially THAT four count|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: South objects to that :) :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: this is an Italian keyboard and we have not figured out how to make smiley faces, so rofl|pg||
nt|athene: just like the @C4 switch in here from @CQ4 against 4@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: you'd think they w9u\\|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphztb: this is the 7th match of a round robin|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Even 5@D was too high|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east through that west's sequence said his 3@H was an advance cue for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east thought that|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely W would have loved to be able to pass 3@d|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|sK|nt|petergill: East (reasonably enough) took West's initial response to show something, not nothing|pg||
nt|athene: advance cue-bids are a nightmare - not only are they impossible to read when they come up, but they infect other auctions too|pg||
nt|athene: true, most of the fault lies with the 1NT response|pg||
nt|hussein2: Well played also|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: half time,  slight break in action here|pg||
nt|athene: most top pairs have revised the standard sequences after jacoby 2nt or the equivalent but everyone has different methods so it's hard to comment|pg||
nt|mr murray: still can go either way. only a board 1/2 separates them|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 2 players out of room  |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|athene: imagine if declarer has @CKQ10|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are not a regular partnership, and perhaps East did not think that fast arrival principles apply to this auction, in which 4@D might not totally set diamonds but be scrounging ...|pg||

nt|othered1: 10-13 card says|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzta: Nunes change his mind and claimed 10 tricks loool|pg||
nt|hedyg: can be good 9 -13 and is unbalanced |pg||
nt|othered1: 9 off the top in 3N and 11 or 12 in @C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: Nunes speaks Spanish?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: excellent 5@C with no wasted values (12 tricks can be made actually) -- can they achieve that?|pg||
nt|han: good decision by Nunes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes they can|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: in a flash|pg||
nt|han: he bid 2S to see if partner has support, then he would want to be in 4S|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm there goes the slam :(|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like 6 imps to Zimmerman|pg||
pc|h2|nt|han: no support then 5C should be good, either as sacrifice or to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe Nunes should have bid splintered in @H over 2@H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|han: I don't think so Hedy, have to check if partner has spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he rembered the 4@s they missed earlier..|pg||
nt|han: more important than slam which seems far away|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: The 2-bids cover a very wide range of shapes, so it's probably good strategy to get aggressive over them before they can unwind things|pg||
nt|xenya: it does feel like EW gave them a little push to the game...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|c9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he can make 12 tricks now in various ways but will ensure his contract|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: well.....!!!|pg||

nt|caitlin: own!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: especially since your hearts are very likely pretty much useless, facing shortage|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not as though your 4-count has got any better|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly|pg||
nt|petergill: I am like Hedy and William, and my partners do forgive me when I pass forcing bids|pg||
nt|hedyg: you have great pds :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12:2 to Lavazza|pg||
nt|mr murray: quick smokde break|pg||
nt|athene: flannery start in the other room but NS still got into the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hedyg: but bd 4 needs correcting|pg||
nt|pelu: or 12-7|pg||
nt|petergill: or Lavazza 12 Bramley 7 when Bd 4 is corrected|pg||
nt|athene: in fact the flannery opener might have made it easier for north as he could double, clearly showing minors (east showed 4@S 5@H)|pg||
nt|mr murray: not easy to beat 3n/t n/s|pg||
nt|rado: 1@S not bad with AK+A here|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: double looks better|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer X|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: is this the "other" version of ghestem?|pg||
nt|reisig: yup|pg||
nt|athene: south might have given 3nt a brief thought but he does have a flat 13 count facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a 4134 hand to me|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|reisig: Hard to Pass|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i just checked NS convention card|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C = black suits|pg||
nt|athene: another 2nt rebid to show a 6-4 - but this one is more limited as to HCP|pg||
nt|3for3: NS can make alot of clubs here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphztb: both N-S players are shown a downward motion at the 3@h bid, showing that it is a weak 2@H opening|pg||
nt|athene: since NS are strong clubbers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bramley had a tough battle to take the 4th qualifying spot in Group A, overtaking the strong Payen team on the last day|pg||
nt|mr murray: my thinking on these hands is when opponent on my right opens 1 hearts and I have kqx I upgrade it to akx and bid accordingly|pg||
nt|ybob: @c lead and trump 3/1 win only 11 tricks i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks about leads and is told standard or 4th best|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H is indeed there but i don't expect many people to be bidding it|pg||
nt|athene: what with the new drug testing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok so having espoused the advantages of not bidding clubs with clubs, it's only fair that we see the other side of the story|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT in the strong club system is a spare bid which can have a special meaning assigned to it|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ lead might give you some problems in 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south's hearts are nice, certainly|pg||
nt|3for3: well this wasnt best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|3for3: game is laydown in clubs or NT...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mr murray: pde lead would certainly beat it|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|pelu: on board 5 63 x 4@H +1 - and the 2@H here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 3@C with black suits it has to be a limited hand of course|pg||
nt|athene: ok, no third chance :) had to be a spade at trick 1 or trick 2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|caitlin: has a clob|pg||

nt|hedyg: as soon as Ala can fix bd 4 score Bramley will take the lead|pg||
nt|athene: it was hard for east to find the spade switch|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: the @HQ and @HJ could have been swapped|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: another 4@S  now makable|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it might look as though west went a bit quietly there, with quite a few points facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't expect his @HK to be worth much|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: when opps have lots of shape and black suits|pg||
nt|athene: and he doesn't have a stack in either black suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the game could easily be making|pg||
nt|athene: another point is that NS chose to bid game - they weren't pushed into it|pg||
nt|athene: as a passed hand, you can use double to show some interesting hand over 1nt|pg||
nt|mr murray: they opened flannery in open room. surely w leads a spade from j10x rather than a heart with xxx. I think:) I have been known to be wrong a time or two or three :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: maybe 5minor 4major or something - whatever you can't show with your normal methods|pg||
nt|petergill: like 5minor and 4major, for example?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and in that case, usually, you want some sort of surprise to double|pg||
nt|athene: that might be just the ticket here :)|pg||
nt|rado: oppps sorry 4 top tricks for defence:)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C majors and south's double just showing a good hand i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes a multilandy X works if you play that|pg||
nt|athene: no convenient dummy entry so declarer will just launch diamonds from hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The undertricks are not vul - if EW choose to play clubs from the top|pg||
nt|athene: with two suits wide open, declarer might just try to steal one diamond then cash his @SAKQ and give up|pg||
nt|athene: this is a harder problem at MP - judging exactly how much to try to get away with|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the italians seem to use double in this way a lot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: no point trying to battle your way to dummy - the finesse is probably wrong anyway :)|pg||
nt|rado: N opened 1@D to plan the bidding if 1@H response , now showed some 15-16 with 3 fit and @H shortness|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Minus 100 (avoid minus 150) is usually the aim at matchpoints|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell thx Katz for his hand, says it is too nice, and lays down his hand|pg||
nt|athene: whereas elsewhere we would be a bit surprised to see double with primary support for one of partner's suits|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: Other room opened 3C so spade fit never found. Here, it was not found either because the club suit is much too pretty to not bid.  However, over 2H, North might have considered 2S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: yes, -100 beats a lot of partscores their way|pg||
nt|ybob: well 2@S shows decent hand 15 16  with single @h, now S dont like his K @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 9@D not smith echo here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: exactly same bidding as OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H is touch and go, I think|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|reisig: If you look at all the finesses ..yes|pg||
nt|athene: i guess west doesn't fancy the 3-level facing a passed hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: the operator in the OR is confirming the result with the players each board before entering it|pg||
nt|petergill: Ruffing a @D exposes four trump losers as the cards lie, so setting up clubs is best|pg||
nt|athene: even if you run into club ruffs you hope it will cost the defender his natural trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @D switch is best, to attack dummy's trumps. Hard to visualize this, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt some sort of ingbermann over the reverse?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|peachy: I am not sure I could have forced myself to pass, vulnerable IMPs, but I just have to re-train myself, because Hamman also passed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: it seems logical on the basis that declarer didn't try to set up a diamond ruff himself|pg||
nt|athene: so, what is not good for him might be good for you|pg||
nt|mr murray: hard to beat if at all possible|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 might turn out to be a big card here|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking if the defence attacked diamonds and declarer went for hearts the defence might get three diamonds, @SA, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that will happen|pg||
nt|mr murray: heart king onside big card|pg||
nt|mr murray: could be  a swingy board|pg||
nt|athene: the @HK is onside but not if you take a double finesse in hearts :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|reisig: If you live by the sword ....|pg||
nt|hussein2: @d now to set|pg||
nt|athene: now if the defence attack diamonds declarer can try to set up long diamonds and never concede a heart at all|pg||
nt|mr murray: no set|pg||
nt|hussein2: or dec ready with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: club lead :)|pg||
nt|hussein2: yeah 3114|pg||
nt|mr murray: new leader|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will simply duck diamonds and if the defence play too many they will suddenly find diamonds are not their suit at all|pg||
nt|hussein2: this lead really costed Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: big time|pg||
nt|athene: the defence's best chance is to attack declarer's communications with a spade lead, maybe|pg||
nt|mr murray: turned out to be worst lead possible|pg||
nt|athene: now he might have to get the hearts right to make|pg||
nt|mr murray: happens sometimes|pg||
nt|mr murray: other times it wouldnt be so costly|pg||
nt|athene: diamond shift now probably gets ducked to the jack and a spade from west, say|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|athene: it's a bit unlucky to find @CAK9x in a hand which has shown 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mr murray: 9 tricks inalready he knows how to finesse club 10|pg||
nt|hussein2: Yeah, @c lead sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|mr murray: faster please|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he would finesse the @C9 if it came down to that i guess|pg||
nt|mr murray: I wanna be around to see the finish|pg||
nt|mr murray: Is there time alloted for naps? :)|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead in the other room and declarer went for the double heart finesse, which was all very bad|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Bart Bramley almost won the Bernasconi competition to try to determine the world's best card player, the last time it was held (Michael Rosenberg won from Bramley and Balicki)|pg||
nt|hussein2: double @H finess should be the %play with some @s entries|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a clear-cut hand to bid or play|pg||
nt|athene: one point worth a mention is that neither east player took his @SA on the first round of the suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: true :) maybe EW try to live by the sword when NV and avoid dying by the sword when vul :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: even with just @SAx they hold it up as long as possible just to annoy declarer generally|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: didn't bramley actually score higher than rosenberg but take too long?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the Par Contest|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@C is OK, as is 3@S|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol Bill|pg||
nt|athene: i am getting suggestions that this is a gazzilli sequence but you wouldn't normally play that with a strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: for the 2nd time in this set, there is a possibility of a forcing 3@D bid being passed. |pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be gazzilli or Bocchi could not bid 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: Feldman only down 1 in 2@HX - the best result all over! but -11 IMP|pg||

nt|athene: you end up at the 3-level all the time which is just too high|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Actually North played @SK and made 10 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: and I suppose Karic has then ruffed a @s and re-enter dummy with trump K|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: NS play a Strong Club system|pg||
nt|petergill: If we had a copy of their system, we would give it to you, but we don't|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s w passing notes|pg||
nt|athene: even after east passes, EW are likely to get pushed too high|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@H here east might feel obliged to give it a fourth|pg||
nt|athene: just in case it makes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|twcho: and finesse in trump and then coup Katz in the endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: now n e passing notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still he doesn't have a very good hand - exactly the wrong holding in diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: many pairs would wheel out some specialised GF heart raise here but the italians like to use 2@C to get the extra room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mr murray: nice stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D must be a splinter with a club fit so Duboin can see 6 or even 7@H on the horizon|pg||
nt|petergill: Here's a more recent and more interesting interview with Norberto Bocchi http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/and-now-lets-talk-about-bridge-interview-to-norberto-bocchi.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: pass clearly forcing|pg||
nt|ybob: wd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: again NS could not find the best suit |pg||
nt|hussein2: would this one put Lavazza ahead? Had many comments last time i said so :)|pg||
nt|ybob: E can be endplay in some minutes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|petergill: Any opinions on what South should do over 3@C? Pass? 3@D? 3@H, trying to reach 3NT? Close decision. |pg||
nt|petergill: North might have an opinion on this matter, at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|pelu: he has a normal opening and a passed pd  = 3@D or pass - we can all see that pass would be the winning option - but not so easy for Ferraro|pg||
nt|petergill: For 3@C, North must have a max passed hand, with long clubs, lacking 4 spades (else neg dbl of 2@H)|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, difficult bidding problem|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that they open 11 counts and even some 10 counts (but I don't know if that applies to hands with long clubs), Pass of 3@C was possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of @CQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: nice bid by Karic although it appears that he has only 15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung goes and gets water to allow Chiu to think|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: or so it seems|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the controls and three good trump support, his hand of course warrants the game call|pg||
nt|peachy: his 15 HCP are all controls and he has a probably useful doubleton, must bid 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: his hand is actually better than most 16 HCP hands|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed!|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: nice intermediates|pg||
nt|peachy: and a fistful of 10/9's that are clearly useful|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the director passes through to see how things are going|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: east hopes to find his partner with a singleton club and two trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mr murray: u is right this time :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: this will tie it surely|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mr murray: win 340|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|twcho: with the balanced nature of the opponents card, there is just no way that this contract can be defeated|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: no kibbitzers are allowed inthe BBO broadcast rooms|pg||
nt|athene: club lead, win @HA, club, ruff, bingo|pg||
nt|athene: that would be the case if south had more clubs and fewer hearts, as you might expect|pg||
nt|athene: life is harsh!|pg||
nt|mr murray: more than tie|pg||
nt|rado: declarer most probably will start @C suit now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mr murray: leader changes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|twcho: Nickell is leading in their  group comfortably after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the director might grant an exceptionto the captain of a team, and allow them to kibbitz, if permission is requested|pg||
nt|twcho: Zen is fighting for the KO berth|pg||
nt|twcho: and they need a good score from this match|pg||
nt|athene: the good news is, he wasn't beating it whatever he led|pg||
nt|petergill: At Trick 1, always plan @CQ play before playing from dummy - don't play fast from dummy, then pull out one card then another from your hand - that would destroy the illusion|pg||
nt|ybob: @H to A @S finesse|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphztb: Now Nickell turn to think|pg||
nt|peachy: while it is slow, I'd like to tell you all who are not in Philadelphia, that the tournament is absolutely top-notch professionally organized.  Everything runs like clockwork, is ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clean, neat, and staffed with "zillions" of TDs and caddies and aides on the floor|pg||
nt|petergill: Not much of an illusion at this level, as all 64 (perhaps only 63?) Souths would find @CQ play|pg||
nt|athene: yes, sorry|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|rado: well ruffing @H also good|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ybob: differents way to play it, i prefer @H to A, finesse @S, @H to K and small, when drop QJX discard @C to endplay|pg||
nt|rado: suppoze DBL was points ( I ahve old CC of HH pair) declarer played well|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c5|pc|h9|nt|petergill: 2@H overcall was both majors and 2@D over 1@D natural as per Kokish training, I believe|pg||
nt|ybob: if drop QJX @H was a clear move too|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: in the match last night, the screen accidently crashed down and everyone jumped.|pg||
nt|peachy: Wow|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: ut the playing conditions are the best I have ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking they could beat it but they can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: ok to make a mistake occaionally. covers up mine :)|pg||
nt|ybob: easy 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Absolutely the best I have ever seen in 35 years of playing|pg||
nt|twcho: tks Ala for all those additional information|pg||
nt|petergill: Is slam easy or hard to bid?|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a very good slam as last board|pg||
nt|petergill: If East can show the singleton @D, then the nice fit can be found|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphztb: I cannot see the explanation that \yeung is writing for the alert on the 2 @H bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: probably Flannery|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C here if you want it enough|pg||
nt|rado: S may jump 4@c leaping|pg||
nt|ybob: E bid first :)|pg||
nt|rado: yes:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: 2NT is some sort of raise - sorry we lack Convention Cards so we cannot enlighten you|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: Neither of thse partrnerships is a regular pairing - we can only look up systems from previous events for estblished partnerships|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would tentatively suggest 2NT isn't natural :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I am glad you are here TOmmy, you know the prevalent systems in Hing Kong|pg||
nt|peachy: Hong Kong|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz leaves the room to go to the restroom|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H = short @D and 2NT is lim+ raise, we think|pg||
nt|pelu: so far only 3 pairs out of 24 has missed the slam|pg||
nt|ybob: calm 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mr murray: onother push|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|petergill: 7@D -100 costs too much at his vulnerability|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Ala Hamilton Day for a good job as BBO Operator|pg||
nt|petergill: -1100 I meant|pg||
nt|petergill: 14 boards per set|pg||
nt|petergill: I think there are 14 boards, then a break|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: i would guess 6@C here is a bit better than 50%, but not much|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|athene: 2-2 clubs and you are ok |pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you need the spade hook and a bit of a following win|pg||
nt|athene: wind|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 2 sp game force and 4 sp was regressive was explanation|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: seems counterintuitive, but he has to fly with King to make, blocking the suit|pg||
nt|mr murray: regressive. Nice word not used enuff in bridge :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|athene: i have a couple of kibitzers who are puzzled by the seating here - they think Sadek-Elahmady are on the Bramley team|pg||
nt|athene: i was just checking the official site but it's refusing to co-operate and give me the team lists :)|pg||
nt|hussein2: Probably because its the first time they play with Italians.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|twcho: even he flies with K, he still need to finesse in @s to make the contract, not the @d|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: i would guess 2@C is some sort of artificial or semi-artificial GF|pg||
nt|athene: it might be "balanced or clubs"|pg||
nt|athene: there has been some mis-labelling of teams in other matches|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: That was the last for this segment. Restart 1:30 Eastern time|pg||
nt|ybob: ok thx all :)|pg||
nt|rado: tx all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: About 50 minutes|pg||
