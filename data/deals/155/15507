mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|phil: EW are Pinot and NS and Deutsch|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|phil: Deutsch is in 1st and Pinot is in 2nd, so both teams should comfortably qualify for the top 4 spots of their group|pg||
nt|phil: although if Pinot were to get blitzed, they might get passed|pg||
nt|kfay: Hello, Phil|pg||
nt|phil: hi Kevin|pg||
nt|kfay: yes, there is an outside shot that Pinot Noir might not qualify for the knockouts if they do quite poorly|pg||
nt|phil: Pinot is on 155 and Wang Dade in 5th has 142|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|kfay: Hello, Michael|pg||
nt|phil: although Wang Dade is the masters of their desting since they are playing Canada with 148 tied for 4th|pg||
nt|phil: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|kfay: Followers of American bridge events will recognize Michel and and Thomas Bessis (a father/son partnership) as members of the Vanderbilt-winning Zimmerman squad|pg||
nt|kfay: They also took 4th in the prestigious Cavendish Invitational Pairs in the past year|pg||
nt|phil: curious choice here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: The full table consisting of most experienced players. But not much to fight for|pg||
nt|phil: spades lay very nice, so I think they dodged a bullet|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: N/S are, of course, a very famous English pair who have represented England many times and placed 2nd in the inaugural World Mind Sport Games in Beijing, which replaced the Bridge ...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|wstuart: that was meant to be a question, "you know him?" but I forgot teh punctuation.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next question -- which is best   1@H or 2N to show 2-lowest|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 11-13 if balanced|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|hedyg: depends on your agreements on what your 2suiter bids show, weak, medium or strong?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i also factor in @S length -- then randomly pick overcall vs 2-suited bid|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Chagas has been a champion for ever. I Dont know whether this is a regular partnership|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: at the other table Piekarek is in 8@S  [4@SX]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which brings up our auction    East DBL probably 4+@S   West DBL probably 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov in West bid 3@S over Hemant Lall's 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Auken really thinking here?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now she needs the K@H in E and when that is 3rd needs the @c finesse as well|pg||

nt|blum1956: The declarer faces a real problem in the trump suit|pg||
nt|blum1956: If he misguesses then there are 4 losers|pg||

nt|hedyg: wow unlike Chagas|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|kdr_fm: possible 3@C is a cue ... we'll see|pg||

nt|blum1956: from time to time these CCs are changed...|pg||
nt|phil: not a lot of difficulty here on this layout - declarer can try either black suit successfully|pg||
nt|kfay: 2@d on this auction was artificial and game forcing, so 2N likely shows a @d stopper for N/S|pg||
nt|kfay: which is why E might not have wanted to lead from his 'longest and strongest'|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|blum1956: Gold cannot see the opponents' cards. He knows that one needs to play that kind of contract very care fully|pg||

pc|h4|nt|kfay: Although I believe it's Kit Woolsey who said that he doesn't like to lead from honor-topped suits that have 3+ holes between the top two cards|pg||
nt|phil: I cannot tell if 2@d is hearts or an artificial GF - judging from 2N it looks like hearts|pg||
nt|kfay: so, for example, A10xx wouldn't be a proper holding but AJxx would|pg||

mb|4D|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some mixed raise?|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2S Michaels- some now play as hearts and specific minor|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: what does Chagas know here to make him pass?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: or king|pg||

nt|odysseus69: looks like he didnt see pd's opening bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhh that is a great explanation|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: so  1N-2@C//2@D  says not 4@H, maybe 4@S    [2@H=4@H and maybe 4@S]|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: he cant even get to dummy to lead the @hQ to tempt a cover :<|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: I suppose he didnt want to duck the club with @D coming back?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is tough on N going up the ace could be so wrong if declarer has say KJxx|pg||
nt|wstuart: His best shot:  tangling the @H entries|pg||

nt|wstuart: Why didn't west bid 1@D 0-6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: So it is official, they are playing a stdish system.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: what do we think about 4 spade bid?|pg||

nt|wstuart: RDBL will show the A, pard will be in a position to judge if the single stopper is right for his intentions in any contract at any level.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT might keep them out of a slam or misjudge whether 3NT or 5@D is a better strain.|pg||
