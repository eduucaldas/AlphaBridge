nt|kareno: Game in hearts to n/s.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: At the moment Deutsch is leading their group with 152 VP, while Canada is second with 142.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I thought this match might be a reprise of the infamous one from Geneva but Deutsch seems to be a transnational team.|pg||
nt|othered1: The real battle is for 4th place, as only the top four in a group qualify for the knockout stage.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: Some may remember that I played for Canada more than once so you'll know where my heart is :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 5th place in the group now is at 130 VP, so Canada especially still must play well to qualify|pg||
nt|kareno: The natural way to play hearts works and I predict eleven tricks.|pg||

nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|stc: Our two teams are 3rd and 4th separated by 1 VP|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: nowadays almost everyone will open N's hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|forcing check back|mb|p|nt|stc: Also an interesting fight between Pepsi and Punch :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|splinter|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: sorry |pg||
nt|blum1956: now making|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|h5|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|othered1: The field has been broken into 16 groups of 9 or 10 teams.  After 8 round robin rounds, the top four teams in each bracket qualify for the round of 64 in KO format, |pg||
nt|anton72: 8 tricks |pg||
nt|anton72: for E-W with best defence|pg||
nt|kareno: And no dancing around, west just bids it - will north get involved?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Correct that, 9 round robin rounds|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, with the expected 4@s intervention.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kareno: No guts no glory!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsu: AND INTO THE TANK BY E|pg||
nt|kareno: Now it's all on the lead if east passes.  But 4 clubs in his hand ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: sorry about caps|pg||
nt|kareno: We didn't think you were shouting :)|pg||
nt|Jacki: Welcome Raija|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Karen, Jacki, all spectators!|pg||
nt|kareno: Raija :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Very hard to east to evaluate if west can be bidding game on only 3 baby trumps and 8 HCP|pg||
nt|kareno: But for sure four clubs in hand suggests a save!  West obviously has a lot of round suit cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: cards on table and still deep in thought ù|pg||
mb|6C|nt|othered1: I like the idea of saving after the 5@C bid, but then what over 6@S?|pg||
nt|kareno: North's bid looks dangerous but with distrbution, he must accept the pressure put on his side by west's great bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Anyone think south's pass will look forcing to north?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: now  <n |pg||
nt|kareno: I'd say it's time for north to quit ... south, after all, passed 1@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I completely agree with that, 4S clear|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzsu: back in the tank |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I personally don't think it's forcing.|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s now in the stratosphere.|pg||
nt|kareno: No forcing passes in this auction.|pg||
nt|peachy: If EW play strong club/precisionm the 4H bid is even more attractive, although in 2/1 or such, I dont think I would have found it|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't think west can consider bidding again, but it's close.  West knows he only holds 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: EW do play a club system|pg||
nt|peachy: Canada is playing with fire now|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks kibs for the strong club info|pg||
nt|othered1: In limited opening systems, jump raises to game can vary from very weak with long trumps to relative flat minimum openings with 3-card support.  |pg||
nt|kareno: These are the auctions that leave you with sweaty palms!!  |pg||
mb|7C|nt|peachy: Danailov has heard enough...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: danailov staring at the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: and his hand|pg||
nt|kareno: However, I think that north's 6@d was over reaching - south passed 1@h and 4@s.|pg||
nt|peachy: ohmy|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, the gamble 6D worked.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, I can't imagine n/s will bid again. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: But I've been wrong twice or three times this auction already in my guesses :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsu: not even sure how the X apppearedù|pg||
nt|othered1: At this vul, if 6@D makes and you're out for 100 or 300, you may have put the match in play on board 2, a scary proposition.|pg||
nt|kareno: It is the bid I think west will wish he had made!!|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: sorry, i retract -- W didn't double 6@D -- he bid 7@C instead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: live by the sword, die by the sword (this time the sword's name was 4H)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|othered1: Note the quiet result in the CR, where west evaluated the hand quite differently (2@H raise)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

mc|10|nt|peachy: difference in system, I think. This EW play Precision|pg||

nt|blum1956: weak NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: link to the running scores, as brought to me by Barry Goren|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dJ|pc|cA|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|c8|nt|mamos: in a way its the sort of result  both sides can feel quite pleased with  -- no big minus score|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mamos: or was .....  commentators curse|pg||
nt|gulyas: knowing S has 6@Hs, among others, makes it less likely he has @DQxx as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: wow I think that a@C was unwise after 5@C|pg||
nt|mamos: but ery difficult looking at two Clubs and six Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: specs talk to me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: at least let me know you are breathing - wierd talking to myself|pg||
nt|petepunt: presume pepsi is the polish player ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cJ|nt|stc: yes|pg||
nt|stc: here @h was better, puting some pressure on dec|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think you are seeded if you are a bit good|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|blum1956: Pepsi should be Jacek Pszczola, the World Champion|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mamos: ok  safely done|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to allow for 4-1 break in both black suits|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|othered1: If Canada wins in a slaughter, Deutsch's qualifying for the KO may be at risk.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|peachy: Karakolev apparently giving this a good long thought but he should have gotten it right|pg||

mb|p|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@c checkback, but I believe not GF|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: 6@h making but not a sort of perfect contract|pg||

pc|d5|nt|petepunt: playing small @H on board 18 seemes strange|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx, however, doesn't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, rather, shouldn't|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I think it's riskier not to overcall.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend says whole different ball game. both agreed cant make 4|pg||

nt|reisig: Roland has chased me all over|pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|mamos: you arrive as EW have a bidding challenge|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Richie would just bid the cold 7NT|pg||
nt|reisig: shld be easy to reach 6@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||
nt|yuval10: won't be so easy to beat this one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: who likes 3N??/|pg||

nt|mamos: not me|pg||
nt|reisig: But --- Huston will bid more|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C is 16+ so S looking ofr possible grand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
pc|c6|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yess!!!  RR|pg||
nt|mamos: im told NS like the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|vicky888:  the openeing 2@d is weak?|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||

pc|d7|nt|stc: BIG POINT NOW|pg||
nt|blum1956: This must go down as opposite to the 5@c but South has to find the diamond switch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is tough|pg||
nt|blum1956: I bet he will|pg||
nt|blum1956: East MUST have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Punch asked range 12 to 14explained|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, the logic seems ironclad...double dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: Q@D looks right yes|pg||
nt|stc: at MP much more tough, here he has to try @d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Jxxx @H, @DA is not impossible|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT and then 3NT by West - ton a kind of Jxxx bidding|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a kind|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: no, true|pg||

nt|petepunt: thx all and well done to the scotts lady|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thinking again|pg||
nt|stc: they may cash up to 6 tricks|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now the defence is safe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gulyas: double dummy, declarer could take 12 tricks, more likely to be satisfied with 10|pg||
nt|mamos: I stand corrected it is of course the USBF  not the ACBL who are the responsible body|pg||
nt|mamos: these two teams have fought a hard battle and are both still favourites to start the Round of 64|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks for the help from you specs   keepng us right :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: one off  or two off or even three off|pg||
