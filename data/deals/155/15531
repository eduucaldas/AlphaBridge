nt|janhamhurg: any spectator?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i c ... thx|pg||

nt|bobholl: part score probably 1nt ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: id N doubles 1nt it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt making 8 tricks i predict :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x now is take out|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: good evening and welcome back to the World Bridge series, round robin, round 3 of 9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levy not happy with his @H holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: what ever they play it must be working to get them this far. :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the N hand is close to 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: willkommen Hedy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: in polish system 1 dia mostly promisses 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: what else as 2@H dangerous contract|pg||
nt|toral5: a dull 3nt to begin with|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/WomensTeams/germany/auken-vonarnim.pdf|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: running totals for all events   http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT was good/bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and you can spy on other tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess same result here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: north has 2 chances to lead his singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: N asked leads are 4th, replied yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|newmoon: somewhat aggressive 3NT by West, no invite|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: possibly 2 down if trump promotion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dec can ruff high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: on the 3rd @D ie|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that needs to play exactly 2 rounds of heart before|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not trump with 7 :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: but East has a maximum, and 3NT looks fairly certain to make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: this should make overtricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry running a bit late here |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 tricks are easy, with the @s position can make more|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 3 @s tricks possible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: actually Hedy,   I think 2N=5+@D and 4+@C|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not 7 of @D (they reverse perhaps)|pg||
nt|monsted: looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: make that overtrick given that approach to @cs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: ok.. i will check|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 3@C would have been longer @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: well over X they play transfers but over 2@H as well?|pg||
nt|hedyg: also seems like an overbid if not good/bad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: sry this is normal|pg||
nt|newmoon: from time to time, I will also tell you what the PAR (best result) is on boards, assuming best declarer play and best defense.  But this is a double-dummy analysis|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: but these ladies are agressive bidders|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: defence right on the ball|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: but 10@s can be a trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so is declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: well good would be in context of big club -- but as you say  they are agressive -- especially with distribution|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: hand not breaking well  |pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Frank :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|d4|nt|bobh1: ducking not a great idea|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @s i mean|pg||

nt|pelu: Morten is here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|pelu: Hansen-Bilde has played very often for the national team|pg||
nt|athene: 4333 with bad spots, so game is really unlikely from east's point of view|pg||
nt|athene: much better to pass and hope south feels obliged to do something, which might be costly for his side|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|mcphee: may manage 9 however|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: with both kings in N and @D 3-3 and @C 2-5 u can make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|mcphee: yes Lauria has a bad hand for much defensive hopes|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: and that 7@C in the dummy is a good card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Caine in 3NT - will make: lead @C2 from S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mcphee: so first blood to Cayne|pg||
nt|athene: declarer not knowing diamonds are 3-3 so he ducks down for a possible squeeze in the minors|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4S72H642DJ62CKQT32,SAJT5HAT9DA974C94,SK943HKJ75DKT5C86,SQ86HQ83DQ83CAJ75|sv|n|nt|ahollan1: well that wasn't quite double dummy defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what that bodes for set |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome back to Paul Orth|pg||
nt|pauleger: hi all :)|pg||
nt|toral5: hi|pg||
nt|newmoon: PAR is 3@S= by e/w, and n/s can make 3@H here|pg||
nt|monsted: no CJ would have made 9|pg||
nt|phil: looked like they could have set it with an early @d shift - the defense had 3@d + 2@h + 2@c ready wafter the @c play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: EW play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many @D from west??|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: looks like easy game here|pg||
nt|toral5: part score battle coming up|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: not as easy as with a 1NT opening :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|not forcing by passed hand|nt|sybarra: 3 @S will not play well,  and 3 nt is a bit iffy also |pg||
nt|wstuart: that was meant to be a question, "you know him?" but I forgot teh punctuation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: seems weak 2's by e/w = 5xM and 4xm combination|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: next question -- which is best   1@H or 2N to show 2-lowest|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 11-13 if balanced|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant imagine cayne not taking the push at imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: south has to cash out at the earliest|pg||
nt|newmoon: this treatment is getting more popular all the time|pg||
nt|bobh1: even non-vul|pg||
nt|phil: its a nice 13 with 3 aces and some intermediates|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: everything lays perfect for declarer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt open 1 no with 5 solid hearts and 3 small spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 17 with a good 5 carder is too strong for 1 nt in my book. what say u ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: depends on your agreements on what your 2suiter bids show, weak, medium or strong?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit strong that's for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: this sequence is better|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you miss a heart contract to often i thk, i woudnt mind the strenth, since the jack of dia is not a great card|pg||
nt|chick: rebid is the problem ... 1@H, P 1@S, then what?   2!N showing 18+?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes i wd upgrade to 18|pg||
nt|bobholl: would bid 2@C if opening 1@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: and sat as many of us would |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is natural..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Vic :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Paul  :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: this could have got ugly for EW |pg||
nt|toral5: is 2@S muiderberg?|pg||
nt|pauleger: i am already looking for their cc|pg||
nt|bobh1: E has a zillion options so it might take a while|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: whatever you bid, it's a lie ... that's why 1N is better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: also i like to bid my 6card major|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: g'day vic|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria produces many fine players and is now a major challenger in Europe|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed, and these 2 are among their finest|pg||
nt|chick: if you had 4 clubs, then I would agree with you|pg||
nt|toral5: south should cash out now..else....|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the Open Room, we have Sabine Auken and Daniela von Armin  n/s resp|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he assured me they play fast|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i also factor in @S length -- then randomly pick overcall vs 2-suited bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: partner as passed hand also confuses my decision making|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Wayne |pg||
nt|bobh1: michael seamon is very fast...this is an eternity for him|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: Chagas has been a champion for ever. I Dont know whether this is a regular partnership|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now comm problems solved|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: i think they make 1 less in this room|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: at the other table Piekarek is in 8@S  [4@SX]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which brings up our auction    East DBL probably 4+@S   West DBL probably 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov in West bid 3@S over Hemant Lall's 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Auken really thinking here?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: this is a very new partnership created just for this |pg||
nt|hedyg: Michel and Thomas Bessis their teammates at the other table|pg||
nt|pauleger: yes, its 5+@s, 4+min|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vicky888:  if he starts a club now will take all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: kaplan rubens tell us that hand is worth 18,10 points|pg||
nt|pauleger: E/W playing baltic club|pg||
nt|newmoon: The 2 girls recently played in the Buffet Cup (bridge's equivalent of the Ryder Cup)|pg||
nt|toral5: tnk u paul|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: but if the @C fin loses and @D comes back|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bobholl: the T9 of @S count also :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now she needs the K@H in E and when that is 3rd needs the @c finesse as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she has many options --  i thought maybe even @H to 10|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: or ruff @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: then she loses the K@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is not a winning option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh ... that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i meant before @H play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is more revealing line|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|hedyg: Alain Levy's wife Ann-Frederique is the sister of Mrs Bessis|pg||
nt|phil: contract in danger now if North unblocks that @dK|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: and less effective|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: i had not thought of this one|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    here a link|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk7: Hi Wayne and Karel|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Karel welcome |pg||
pc|hT|nt|kdr_fm: any excitement ? :>|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|8|nt|odysseus69: better to exit with heart from dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: he guessed it wrong|pg||
nt|bobh1: but reasonably i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: asked if diamonds 3<3|pg||
pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: so this will be a none gain at a push in 4@S|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mcphee: non|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|pelu: but 5@C cost only 100-300|pg||
nt|athene: it's very common these days to use 2NT response to an overcall to show a strong raise|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1 down in 5@C it seems but this is a hard save to find|pg||
nt|athene: then you can use the jump cue as a mixed raise and the simple cue as a 3-card raise|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: it's felt that it's more important to show different sorts of raise quickly and unambiguously|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: oohhh big board|pg||
nt|hedyg: Danailov did well not to disc @d|pg||
nt|phil: he won't like the answer|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: A9 of hearts was too much, he would have made without it|pg||
nt|bobh1: he played S for a @h honor...the winning guess was to play N for the K speciically|pg||
mb|1C|nt|anton72: could u explain for us this move from S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C, usually no 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: S was dummy, she didnt move|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: 7@H looks good|pg||
nt|newmoon: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades here.   But they me tempted to try for game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|an|support|nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall will also open 2@C since they play a form of Precision|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be on their way with a raise of @H's |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will u bid the 6 carder @S suit as 1 @S 2@S or pass ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead 3NT no chance but will he find it|pg||
nt|newmoon: But they may be...|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|monsted: great result DK i open |pg||
nt|bobh1: lucky to only lose 5|pg||
nt|monsted: 5 C only 1 down|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: how ever they do it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: singleton spade is big - if N can get a spade cue from south at some point ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door Townsend and Gold who were Englands leading pair in Bejing are now a dissolved partnership but fulfilling all engagements|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now X i would have passed a reopening ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spade?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|toral5: with a @D king wastage he still accepted|pg||
nt|newmoon: e/w must ensure 2 @Ds and at least 2 trumps|pg||
nt|toral5: wt if he escapes a @D lead and guesses trump correctly?|pg||
nt|pauleger: difficult lead for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@C has chances|pg||
nt|newmoon: the small from doubleton is popular in Norway, and Leif-Erik Stabell lives in Zimbabwe now and has popularised it here|pg||
nt|pauleger: declearer might try a @c to the K @h to the table and throw a @d on @cA|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the open room N never bid at all|pg||
nt|phil: Michaels hand has some defense and a lousy club holding - perhaps he should x? |pg||
nt|bobh1: here he bid twice|pg||
nt|monsted: 4 C was was the key for N|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess the 1@c opening had a different meaning|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: the open pairs are also starting today...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes 5@C is the best contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: if she can ruff out the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in heated auction Lalls get to 6@C|pg||
nt|monsted:  1 C here are 3+ in club|pg||
nt|bobh1: this has to be a forcing pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c bidding out the shape - so a sing Spade is indicated|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow unlike Chagas|pg||
nt|bobholl: i stop @S and you ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they will try 3 no and go 4 off|pg||
pc|s6|nt|toral5: looks like making|pg||
nt|pauleger: with trumps breaking 4-1 i think he will get forced out of trumps on that line of play|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible 3@C is a cue ... we'll see|pg||
nt|sybarra: but question is is the @D bid viewed as cue |pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess jimmy didnt see it that way|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|janhamhurg: 3 off|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he does, West ruffs 3rd @H with ace, and with no entry to dummy left, South has to play trumps from hand, losing a further 2 trumps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: 2 off i guess|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: there is the 3@s cue now N is off|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N will ask,  then ask for extra, such as K |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Norths pass meant as more encouraging than immediate 3 hearts. I expect Townsend-Gold to reach game|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: Levy bid his hand strongly even though he knew that KJ@S not worth much..|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the @D K isn't rigth in a doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: oh well,  just bid it!|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think Levy can bid more than 2@s|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: South hand will be no surprise I think |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Bilde asked about count.. Cayne said basically standard|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|phil: really wishing he doubled now|pg||
nt|bobh1: can see not doubling at matchpoints but at imps what the heck?|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they happen to make on a distributional fluke, it's 4 imps|pg||
nt|bobh1: in the meantime you were hoping to make a red game|pg||
nt|phil: 500 mitigates most of it - 150 does not|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you have some equity to protect|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no one is looking particularly awake this morning.. including the viewgraph operator..  |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kdr_fm: @s + ruff.  @SJ will be worrying ..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Townsend just bashed 4@H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: 1@s-2@H-p-4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would go 2 off but if he tries to make 4 off|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|toral5: now he is down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: counting points now|pg||
nt|vicky888:  he will try to make by giving dia|pg||
nt|vicky888:  and down4|pg||
nt|newmoon: East does not have to take a chance of being overruffed|pg||
nt|phil: considering its 8:00 on the west coast, one of the commentators is included|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|toral5: wt if he had ruffed 3rd @C and than low @H?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess is the bets play in imp|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: yes you do worry  |pg||

nt|athene: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: a mild chuckle |pg||
nt|athene: hansen might imagine that 5@C is a cue for hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is one of the reasons many experts prefer to open 1@d on these hands|pg||
nt|athene: that looks quite likely from his point of view - he knows his partner is probably void in clubs anyway|pg||
nt|athene: certainly, two-suiters can be hard to bid when you open 2@C and run into pre-emption|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is there any option that doesn't need @S finesse?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @CQ coming down and endplay in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ruff out @ss and same hand has Kx in @D and Q@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: or Qx in @c and K@D on side.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hadn't thought about guessing @DKx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my sliderule tells me -- just take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: easier when we see the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: it means the bee in polish (his name)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now offering choice of games between 3NT and 4@H.|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be they will survive and gain an imp :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: yes a little lucky 4 spade here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: peeking at the hands confirms that :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: most as hearts and minor|pg||
nt|monsted: nice |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: much laughter, nice bidding from the North|pg||
nt|phil: very nice and a big board for Cayne|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think we have to fault NS in this room for not interfering, as bad as you might think the auction in the other room was|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: they have 13 VPs more than the 5th team|pg||
nt|phil: was told Jimmy showed A + A with 3@c|pg||
mc|13|nt|pauleger: I think I would have bid 3@c directly|pg||
nt|toral5: this surely should be a gain for josef and cards|pg||
nt|toral5: even direct 3c on 1@S is ok.but 2@C is something to much on dbl|pg||
nt|newmoon: a bit conservative by South here.   3@C first time would certainly help|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, P|pg||
nt|phil: so 7@d is eassssy|pg||
nt|monsted: y 3 C nw should be |pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SAKT92HKQDT943CA6,SJ65H862D872CT972,SQ73HT973DKQ6CK85,S84HAJ54DAJ5CQJ43|sv|b|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess there are hands east can have where 7@S makes and 7nt doesn't |pg||
nt|athene: but not so many|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|athene: if bilde had simply bid 4@D over 4@C then west would have done something interesting|pg||
nt|athene: like 5@S splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now at least you are playing in the right suit|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|d|nt|mcphee: so I am told Seamon also opened 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ah well, Burn's Law claims another victim|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: and the squeeze will work automatic - a double show up (S has in 2 card position @CQ+1@H and N @S- 1@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: so the auction on 6 is also off to a wild start|pg||
nt|pelu: but no 3@C overcall from Dennis Bilde - so easy to find @D-fit|pg||
nt|athene: in my experience it really pays huge dividends to intervene over 2@C|pg||
nt|pelu: 100% agree|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh so the will find 7@D then|pg||
nt|athene: even regular partnerships have lots of mix-ups|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt or 4@S here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: east will come to two clubs and two red aces i guess|pg||
nt|athene: lauria might be wondering whether he has to run the @S10 to pick up @SJxxx with west|pg||
nt|mcphee: right but he can not go wrong|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out another problem for declarer - he might fear that clubs are 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: so he might not think he can afford to knock out both red aces|pg||
nt|athene: and he might play for west to hold the @DJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am sure that is his major worry|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe the 2NT scramble will point him in the right direction|pg||
nt|athene: if east had five clubs he would be more likely to bid 3@C over the redouble|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: not so sure it is so clear about the @C length|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|athene: of course if east does have five clubs and both red ace-jacks, he will have a bit of a problem discarding on spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|h5|pg||

nt|sybarra: land on feet anyway |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a good slam. really should be bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 5 3NT by N in OR after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|odysseus69: an Ace - 3 trumps- and the right doubleton- and partner bid 4D vul on his own - East is nearly worth 5 Clubs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cant understand Kurka's play esp as he is not vul|pg||
nt|pauleger: slam time now|pg||
nt|newmoon: a kib says "von Arnim overcalled 2@C   Auken in 3N"|pg||
nt|phil: if 3@c is "4 controls" (A=2, K=1), not as easy as West could have @hK + @cAK|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: geeze :>  Dont understand the @dk without at least one round of trumps ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: he made!|pg||
nt|pauleger: with the @d finesse working, 3N would make|pg||
nt|toral5: finally a slam:)|pg||
nt|newmoon: yep  3NT should make on previous|pg||
nt|toral5: atlast piekarek got the cards to pass:)|pg||
mb|2C|an|asking, not game forcing|nt|hedyg: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|newmoon: our first slam now    :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if @S 33 it is bad what he did|pg||
nt|toral5: is this reverse  bergen or some strong @S raise?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unusual method for me|pg||
nt|newmoon: well... I will guess 2-way bergen 3@C:  either 7-9 or 16+|pg||
nt|phil: still, I don't a lot wrong with 4@d by East in the OR|pg||
mb|2D|an|at least 12|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i guess that gains if North started with singleton @DJ or @D10|pg||
nt|newmoon: but 4NT negates that.   forget what I said|pg||
nt|bobh1: given they open 10-11 counts, 2@c is some kind of invite|pg||
mb|2S|an|8 to 10|nt|hedyg: no X by N..|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth go 2 down but information double asks for bid :)|pg||
nt|phil: get your suits and set trump when the auction is under stress|pg||
nt|monsted: 2 c is Toronto|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: this might go down a packet|pg||
nt|toral5: how can he blackwood?|pg||
nt|newmoon: slam cold in 3 strains here:  @H/@S/NT|pg||
nt|toral5: the ladies did bid 3nt last brd and deservingly picked up 6 imps|pg||
mb|r|nt|hedyg: what does Chagas know here to make him pass?|pg||
nt|bobh1: relay to 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: or king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C not true stayman  -  initially it is search for 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like he didnt see pd's opening bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhh that is a great explanation|pg||
nt|pauleger: Josef and Cards closing the gap|pg||
nt|phil: Michael picked a very bad time to get involved|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  1N-2@C//2@D  says not 4@H, maybe 4@S    [2@H=4@H and maybe 4@S]|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am still looking for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe an Ace was hidden|pg||
nt|hedyg: sticky cards?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: what is a packet sunil?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kdr_fm: E/W philosopy is no invites it seems.  Vul in teams probably fair enough, otherside rates to bid em|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they play the hands well,  so add a point or 2 |pg||
nt|pauleger: trailing only by 8 imps now|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib suggests that 3@C is some form of Jacoby raise and they use 2NT for something else|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky to find a @H picture or even xx @H with partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 3c=14 plus w 4 s|pg||
nt|newmoon: missing game on previous board resulted in 6-IMP swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 4@D|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx operator|pg||
nt|pauleger: I think Auken - von Arnim´s auction will take much longer :)|pg||
nt|toral5: thts wt i thought;a strong raise to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 9 HCP, 2 4 card suits which might come in, 5:3 IMP odds and one of teh finest declarers on the planet playing the hand.  I'd give it a shot.  ;)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kdr_fm: he has alot of work here|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't think even Sam can make this one though.|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help |pg||
nt|wstuart: May need help of biblical proportions.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk 2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 down i guess :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so - 500 is an indian packet:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: but xxx @H are bad news|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i think Landen was worth 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: would think a double instead of 3N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i haven't quite figured out why they do that -- but i haven't given up    someday i'll understand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: he cant even get to dummy to lead the @hQ to tempt a cover :<|pg||
nt|phil: Jimmy's blood pressure rose and fell greatly in the last 30 seconds|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Jimmy said.. I could have bid 3C...  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: I suppose he didnt want to duck the club with @D coming back?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is tough on N going up the ace could be so wrong if declarer has say KJxx|pg||
nt|wstuart: His best shot:  tangling the @H entries|pg||
nt|wstuart: North knows south started with about 8HCP - so, one entry out of the KQ@D he is knokwn to hold.  Where is that card is what he is wondering.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: so over 2@H which does not deny 4@s she decided to play 3 NT?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: throw in a couple of beers and it is a german packet :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|toral5: @D ace gone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kdr_fm: N/S have 2@H , 1@C & 1@D for sure|pg||
nt|wstuart: good play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and a curry sausage!|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|kdr_fm: thats curtains|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|bobh1: N's decision not to double was costly, unless he can find a way to make this|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|wstuart: if the @C was on, @C broke and the he found @SJTx he could have still made it.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: bd 6 NS in 4@s|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|phil: he should make it if he plays clubs to be 4-4|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: now 2 down is sure |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the endplay has gone so we see an extra thick packet: 800|pg||

nt|bobh1: E will be under a little pressure|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: I believe S should either pass or bid 2NT there.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: hope chagas continues his conservative streak no I guess not|pg||
nt|bobh1: thinking back to the earlier hand when W failed to double...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Mike asked the meaning of the 4C, answer was not discussed, no special meaning. |pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps Michael sees this as a forcing pass situation|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|newmoon: bd 8:  the girls are in 3NT in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if @ss were not 2-2 she was down so she played for them to be 2 2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kdr_fm: 2/2 split or singleton Q is what odds anyone ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but natural?????|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this looks like a tough hand - i think you need to be 4 of either M rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: girls :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: for -1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: East might weell have owed one more bid on the last hand, but west would have declined anyway.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: hope they agreed here what 2@d is|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 clubs is best|pg||

nt|hedyg: but when it is right......|pg||
nt|odysseus69: needs to find spade queen- favourite to do soo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: on a @D lead NT can become bloodt|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that looks like a natural lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H/4@S makes double-dummy.   3NT is -1|pg||
nt|pauleger: I am a 2@c bidder here|pg||
nt|newmoon: that assumes best defense of course|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: bloody (yt are close sry)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: this is a bit more scientific than open room auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry= thought bidding had died|pg||
nt|mrdct:  odd that north didn't reverse with 2@s there|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low heart lead, is correct to play the queen, only legitimate play|pg||
nt|mrdct:  chance for a swing here for sugar millers|pg||
nt|newmoon: the odds favour a club fit after 1NT I guess|pg||
nt|pauleger: just 16 points and no information from pd. why go to the 3 level|pg||
nt|pauleger: if pd bids 2@s after my 2@c he has a good hand for @c|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@C would be my choice tho|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this looks down for sure|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 off or 3, depends on play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: right -- i missed if @S 3-1 then always down|pg||
nt|pauleger: and I can make a move|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the advantage of 2@S is that it's forcing and p might bid 3@c or you can pattern out your hand nicely if he bids 2NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: contents|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 of dia asking for a high color- cant be spade..|pg||
nt|bobholl: why not ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec ak10 on the table|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not quite impossible :) but indeed improbable|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops.   Now he will play a trump to dummy, instead of dble-finessing off table|pg||
nt|pauleger: yes, if 2NT is some sort of Lebensohl, agree|pg||
nt|mrdct:  might go for a bit of a cross-ruff here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: leading pds "suit"|pg||
nt|wstuart: West was so afraid of his singleton @S that he tried to muddy the waters with 1@D?  Interesting action at this vulnerability.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: was 2D n-s made 3 |pg||
nt|phil: another opportunity for Cayne here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: signal issue there - may have been better to duck the @H and not have to make a decision|pg||
nt|wstuart: OK, not a Polish club, but something where 1@C is forcing and 1@D is 0-6.  :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  might see this auction push to the 5-level with NS' double fit in the red suits|pg||
nt|newmoon: dble-dummy solver states that 5@S can be made here|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: NS have a good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|newmoon: bidding box with S/W   West is thinking, I reckon|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this 1@D=same as last hand 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: go figure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and seems % to bid it with south hand, might be making|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still conservative by Chagas -|pg||
nt|mrdct:  3@s some sort of transfer preempt i guess|pg||
nt|newmoon: probably solidish minor|pg||
nt|pauleger: I don´t like such preempts with a 3 card major |pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm told solid minor|pg||
nt|newmoon: e/w are bowled out here, it seems|pg||
nt|mrdct:  3NT an attempt to buy the contract undoubled|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this wont be south thinking|pg||
nt|newmoon: oh|pg||
nt|phil: so the true score is Pharma 20|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will enter it as soon as these guys slow down|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct:  this still wont be easy fro EW to find their @s fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: 1NT looks strange by chagas|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H are dificult to take against @C contract (han even 5)|pg||
nt|pauleger: 5@c is on, too|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@C pass or correct?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=7-10 and as you see can have 4 card major since 1@D usually DENIES 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|phil: bidding 7 isnt very realistic however|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: what would you bid?|pg||
nt|bg: nothing like a flat hand to stir things up|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it looks like a 2NT bid from here|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@c pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Obviously, none of us are what they ARE playing, but we are sure that it is not Polish @C.  |pg||
nt|mrdct:  north may have been better bidding 4@d pass/correct as he wouldn't be too unhappy playing in 5@C if south has @C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes.  4@Cx is too revealing|pg||
nt|newmoon: and yes, 5@C also makes, Paul|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@Dx is only -2... |pg||
nt|phil: but the NS action makes 6 unachievable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: so 11 to Pharmaservice|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: landen is wondering if he needs to underlead his spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and surely worth 4S over 4H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|newmoon: I am surprised.   4@Ds in West and dble of 4@C surely shifts the decision to 5@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: nice bid by lev - N ignores it|pg||
nt|wstuart: South will try for slam, but we hope they won't get there as the @D loser and @C loser just won't go away.|pg||
nt|bg: here is a rarity 6 h which should a push in any duplicate game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only an accident can stop them -|pg||
nt|bobholl: cuebids enough so guess this is NF|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 hearts here is going down, 3 club is slightly dangerous bid, but makes for sure|pg||
nt|pauleger: Jens playing with a Norwegian guy|pg||
nt|phil: no systems over penalty x's I guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|newmoon: South passed first round?   wow|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: sometimes pd has 109x in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=6+@H MAX  [but limited by failure to open 1@C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 10xx|pg||
nt|pauleger: Sveindal i guess :) So no Belgians ;)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: 4 clubs shows a good second suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea how they play 4@c, as 5 5 ?|pg||
nt|bg: 4D = cue|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i agree esp since he was a passed hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but i admit that i woudnt have bid 3 clubs, may be over 2 spade, if they bid that|pg||
nt|bobholl: especially with the bad breaks to be expected :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs play transfers after the neg DBL, so 1NT probably showed @Cs.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i was thinking!|pg||
nt|newmoon: I thought I saw Belgian flag.  I must be mistaken...|pg||
nt|newmoon: this bidding is so strange to me.   Anyone?|pg||
nt|pauleger: It´s a Danish flag ;)|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib says "1@d= nebulous i think"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: north hand lends itself to a stayman auction to be followed by invitational 2s bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you go the jacoby route i think must continue with 2nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was time for keycard - that double helped Chagas  -now keycatd|pg||
nt|bg: xx=cue|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: same bid till 3@H in OR and then S bid............4@H!!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: here i am almost sure Levy plays XX as 1st rd control|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably thinking he hand is gettting better and better|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh and there i thought 1NT a mini psyche to discourage the opps :>|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you are vulnerable|pg||
nt|phil: 1N xx'd would have been interesting and probably makes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bg: 4s=cuw|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some undos needed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might think Chagas has void|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: he hopes they will play @C for him not a bad idea|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Hemant likes to give his son practice as declarer :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bg: 5H=2 no Q|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@d transfer|pg||
nt|phil: Seamon could run to 2@d - which is not pretty|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|wstuart: Muriel1 points out that the @CA lead will let 6@S make - however, due to the NS methods here, it is played from teh wrong side for thsi to happen.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: finally - but Levy should have bid this over 4C|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Vic? could they not have a grand?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure - but with aka +club king - all South needed to know was AKQ of hearts and club ace- key card was invented for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2@h obligatory|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kdr_fm: cant see anyway for this to make - not Squeeze on|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|newmoon: maybe 2@D was just "forcing"|pg||
nt|newmoon: oh, ok|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: now that they don't there is trouble lurking|pg||
nt|phil: but I guess no one wants to step out and take a position this early in a long match|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|kdr_fm: Spec making the point that IF 1NT was @C's then 4@C cue is not a good idea|pg||
nt|bg: Joey would have claimed by now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am assuming that 4C showed 5-5 and decent club suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|pauleger: I would understand the double as: Partner, i had a penalty double over 1@s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|newmoon: yes, and a x of 1S would certainly g'tee @Hs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|kdr_fm: basically needs @HK to come down in 3 .. not happening|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: one back to Pharma|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|athene: lauria downgrades the hand from a 1nt opener because of the rubbish minor-suit honours|pg||

nt|mcphee: good match|pg||

nt|newmoon: was a costly 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: x was to|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: last for now|pg||
nt|phil: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: coming up i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Some badly needed IMPs for Mahaffey.  We have a tight race now.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c now for EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: slamtime!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pauleger: but that´s a thing, which is discussed here plenty of times. What the X specifically shows (does it promise some extra defence against 2@h or not)|pg||
nt|phil: Im so used to 16 board segments :)|pg||
mb|2C|an|10 to 12 and 5H-5C|nt|bobholl: oh oh they will surely bid it now |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i might have bid 3 dia with north|pg||
nt|bobholl: then he would have an easy 4@D bid what now i don't know |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be 5 dia:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the polish @C is dificult now :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be asking aces?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: afraid to lose an ace and a @H|pg||
nt|pauleger: 2NT is the normal takeout in that situation|pg||
mb|3C|an|?|nt|fabsayc: pollack not liking this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose you double and pray|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: costly misunderstanding for team Dhampur|pg||
mb|4H|nt|odysseus69: back to back slams|pg||
nt|bg: interesting started 1 spade not 1 club maybe systemic problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 @c is 16+|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play precision|pg||
nt|odysseus69: strong club|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Bulgaria/karakolev-danailov.pdf|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far so good |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or just 6, which i dont like- but never argue against sucess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: here he seems to be hoping landen has seven clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or hearts double stopped|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we hear all the tme - "good hand for stronfg club" - I find myself saying "bad hand for strong club"|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: fast claim|pg||
nt|phil: so looks like a push - see you in a few|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and the long hand getting the tap |pg||
nt|bg: I think E has to keep bidding  otherwise a systemic weakness|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: P has enough if he has a 12-14 NT so ?!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: He'll be short a trick..  He could try blocking hearts but that still gets him only 8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East has done well or got lucky -|pg||
nt|bobholl: his @H posession is bad |pg||
nt|bobholl: if w has @D points they are wasted|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with ace of dia instead of the king of hearts a nice, but difficult to bid grand|pg||
nt|bobholl: but than in need of a singleton @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: yes a 4144|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play @S iso @C :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it looks as if we are waiting for the boards to come from the other table, is that correct?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i mean the results, sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: were they playing 14 or 16 boards ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 14 he said! so all over, 3 more sessions to come|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thx all for watching!|pg||
nt|bobholl: if i rember rigth it was 14 so tya :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 2NT scrambling|pg||
nt|wstuart: Why didn't west bid 1@D 0-6?|pg||
nt|newmoon: perhaps an immediate 2@C by South (not forcing to game in competition) would have solved everything|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wstuart: So it is official, they are playing a stdish system.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: if the @S were 3/3 onside he'd make at this point - pitch a @h on this and the @Ck|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|nt|bg: both|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have bid 2@c with the W hand and that would have gotten us there fast|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: if he believes the lead blocking hearts is a serious option|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@S makes double-dummy.   Tougher when playing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: for those who don't now West -- if memory serves  Jaggy's first time playing in the United States led to a rousing victory in the 1987 Reisinger Teams  on a team that included 4 ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: players from 4 different countries  [Jaggy India, Zia Pakistan, Billy Cohen Canada, Ron Smith USA ]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: but i digress|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|newmoon: easier to make 6@S if first trump played is the 9 off table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pauleger: no|pg||
nt|pauleger: east would play low |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: now he may go down three|pg||
nt|newmoon: that's ok... pins the 7.   1 trump loser only|pg||
nt|pauleger: but would you really play low from hand?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: in the other room South in 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: if she plays A@H and @H there is a possible trump promotion|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have thought so.  The lead AND the auction suggest a heart honor in north.|pg||
nt|newmoon: lol   that's why I said double-dummy.    Tough hand, I admit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: would "time out" for declarer |pg||
nt|bg: I agree Hedy 2 clubs is a good call firstly it is a game force and secondly it allows par to make a normal rebid|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: is that the right Queen?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if she plays Q@H she wins for sure|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib reports: "Sementa played @s to 8 for 12 tricks"|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|kareno: It's a gutsy play to block the suit...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Karen :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: very well done|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Thanks, Martin :)|pg||
