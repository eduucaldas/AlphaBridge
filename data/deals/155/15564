nt|kareno: Sapan :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@s some sort of flower bid.|pg||
nt|toral5: hi karen:)|pg||
nt|kareno: I suspect it is east who is thinking - north has said his piece.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|toral5: 3@C will be in easy make especially aftr a dbl frm west|pg||
nt|kareno: Good trump lead by west|pg||
nt|toral5: and now no @C guess|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: For those who don't know the term, 'flower bid' means a fit showing jump.|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: yeah.thts wt i was typing to a kib:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|toral5: @D 8 is gud here.so 9 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa jiggles his leg while Greco thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: With the diamond in the pocket, it's an easy hand for declarer.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be jiggling his leg a lot this match I think :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|toral5: trumps now ll restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|toral5: ouch a @D discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: players show their hands|pg||

nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
mb|p!|mb|3D|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||

nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play of the cards :( |pg||

nt|bjacobs: A good shot, but no dice|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves: defense at imps or rubber bridge is much easier in many ways than at matchpointed pairs or board a match|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: you can more simply plan as the goal is clear, defeat the contract, except is situations where it is doubled etc|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|kareno: He can't see the spade suit.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C!|nt|kareno: The contract is easy from south but not from north|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|toral5: 3@C looks like 54 45 minors weakish|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin shifts backwards in his chair as he thinks|pg||
nt|kareno: Flower bid again :)  e/w can make clubs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he inquires further about the bidding and grunts at Hampson's response|pg||

nt|bjacobs: G/M play Standard|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|algraves: well , Moss Gitelman very standard, |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: and I think e-w  also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double or 1@H?|pg||
mb|d|nt|algraves: and so so Elahady and Sadek although they may play the balanced club with weak NT hands so that 1@D is natural,|pg||
nt|algraves: not sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H |pg||
nt|bjacobs: To me, that North hand is right on the margin between the two|pg||
nt|algraves: Fred deems his hand too good for 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: AGREE|pg||
nt|algraves: planning to rebid 1NT perhaps over 1@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: i Like the suit quality|pg||
nt|algraves: NS can make only 2@H|pg||
nt|algraves: EW can make 4@D somewhat luckily|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C jump fit may suit the east hand|pg||
nt|algraves: they may not play it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: true but it is a useful gadget i think|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: bd 1 is entered|pg||
nt|algraves: so that confirms what I remember about this great Egyptian pair. they play the balanced club 11-14 in a standard structure|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so 1@D is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|algraves: so Sadek is free to jump on 4 poor trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if you think how bad the south hand might be this is a peach|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|algraves: minus 50 into the opps 130|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: but nv games are not to be bid frivolously|pg||
nt|algraves: note here again at IMPS where you are relatively content to sit around and beat 3@H|pg||
nt|algraves: at Matchpoints whether to bid to 4@D more of an issue|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: you all will have lots of space to fill,  we seem to be at snails pace|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s bidding to 3nt?|pg||
nt|algraves: 3NT easy as the diamonds suit does not have the club ace for entry|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|algraves: ew have 6 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: very std response|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|algraves: so this is GF 2NT as are all there 2NT resp|pg||
nt|algraves: they do not play 2NT as forcing raise over major|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah  a nice gadget|pg||
nt|algraves: so North is quite correctly bringing 5@C into the picture for game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT nat is a "gadget"?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well gf it is|pg||
nt|algraves: that will make also as even with a @D lead the @D can be discarded on @H before touching trumps|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3@H is a good bid by Moss.  For example, switch North's red suits to see why |pg||
nt|roswolf: my grand om always passed 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: personally I prefer it but we are a dying breed that is for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes ... 2NT natural is a bit like Latin - a dead language|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not just in this auction, but in practically all auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm still alive and kicking in england|pg||
nt|algraves: so natural bidding here, Brad showed his concetration and interest in @C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Latin?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup our public schools still use it|pg||
nt|algraves: well, unless you are going to play a sophisticated structure that starts with 2@C on balanced hands over 1Major|pg||
nt|roswolf: and lawyers like me - i was a classics scholar at university|pg||
nt|algraves: then it is better for you constructive bidding and NT posistioning and keeping defense in dark to play 2NT as balanced GF|pg||
nt|algraves: then 2 over 1 is real suit and 2NT means you want to play NT|pg||
nt|algraves: rather than have 15 ways to raise partners spades|pg||
nt|algraves: try 14 ways and get two natural bids back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes in england it was called baron and actually worked within acol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd make a great debater Allan ... the question for the evening: "should 2NT be natural" - AG for the affirmative|pg||
nt|algraves: right oh|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: we finally made a decision here and now the conversation between W and S|pg||

nt|bjacobs: songs of the 60s goes very well with 2NT natural!|pg||
nt|algraves: well 5@S is on the Club guess|pg||
nt|algraves: 3NT will have two chances to fail with a @D lead or switch|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps East will declare 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but it improves the mood procul harum keeping latin alive|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: HMMM THAT IS WEAK!?|pg||
nt|algraves: ok home and cooled out in a solid game|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves: the main reason for the 2@D bid is that the suit is so good that being doubled is unlikely and this is the last safe time to make sure you get a @D lead particularly against 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good bid, but actually might have been quite disastrous on this setup|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: in europe weak 2's have been devalued a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves: go ahead and try it at home, just make sure the suit is solid in the middle to forestall a penalty X|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: The other advantage of the weak 2@D is that it's quite hard to defend, because there are TWO open majors|pg||
nt|algraves: EAst will finesse the @C of course|pg||
nt|algraves: after getting the kids off the street|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh i didnt mean to criticise(too much anyway) it is just so different from european bidding methods|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|algraves: SAdek is thinking of a 4-1 @S break|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: this hand also shows that you do not have to always open 1NT especially with 4@C and 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Passed out surprises me|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would never pass out the north hand|pg||
nt|algraves: as you have no rebid problem after opeing 1@C|pg||
nt|algraves: so you get to 4@S|pg||
nt|algraves: however the downside is that you give away information|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Undaunted, the 2@D opening arises again from the ashes of the previous board|pg||
nt|algraves: that is one of main issues in modern expert bidding|pg||
nt|algraves: designing more and more ways to get to game contracts quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is too chunky for me nv|pg||
nt|algraves: while still being able to investigate slams accurately|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gitelman won't consider game, I assume, so this swing will be around 4 imps worth|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|algraves: and will require some play as they say|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: @CK lead may assist|pg||
mb|2S|nt|algraves: the hand is actually relatively well postioned for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|algraves: and a @S lead definetly loses contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the contract seems predestined but surely the play is not too difficult!?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is very tricky to play though - if you have to ruff too many spades, you will likely lose two trump tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: well it wil be difficult , and declarer is in the unfortunate positoin of not being able to see  the opponents cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the play is plenty difficult|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: we however are free to make 4@H as the play progresses|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: the k of clubs hit the table quickly enough|pg||
nt|algraves: it is attractive to declarer to ruff @S and take two heart finesses through west which will fail , unlucky|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|algraves: and really no good reason not to do that|pg||

nt|algraves: yes|pg||
nt|algraves: fred may now just play a and trump to avoid complications|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing a spade now setting up the x ruff does seem to work|pg||
nt|algraves: and then a third trump sinks him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Double dummy, declarer ruffs 4th club with the ace, draws trumps finessing East, and takes the diamond ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the boss is playing on the right lines|pg||

nt|algraves: the trouble with unblocking the @D and playing Ace and a heart|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|algraves: so well done all around , jolly good show|pg||

nt|algraves: thanks to mr Geoffrey Wolfarth or England|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: N/S have a choice of which game to go down in ... 4@H perhaps, which needs a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
nt|algraves: well this is an unlucky 4@H down one|pg||
nt|algraves: with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|algraves: it is a make with any other lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you 3NT might make for a similar reason ... low diamond lead from West for example|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|algraves: as you can maneuver a diamond discard on the @S before trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: What's more, if East happens to let go his TWO of diamonds, 3NT might make anyway|pg||
nt|algraves: Moss upgrading his 5 card club suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|algraves: to make up for his aceless ten count with pitiful trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might just be 3NT, and I fancy it would make|pg||
nt|algraves: and intneding to limit raise in hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 3@H next?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|algraves: well it seems a position not to show the support|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Oh, I thought Fred might leave 3NT once it had been offered|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|algraves: but Brad Moss might have pulled off a coup if left to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I thought he was indeed going for the brilliancy award.  How could West possibly diagnose his Qx?|pg||
nt|algraves: the audience informs me the diamonds block|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The audience is wrong|pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves: ah ,|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|algraves: well I never watch the spots anymore anyway|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: But I very much doubt West would have found the top diamond lead.  In fact he might have tried a spade, which doesn't work either|pg||

nt|toral5: its actually silly,but belladonna said this in his interview:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone have the video link?|pg||

nt|toral5: he,benito and forquet..:)true legends of the game|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c can be made with the Morton's Fork coup.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's very, very unlikely to be bid, however.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: maybe not so unlikely lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Morton's Fork would be leading low to dummy's heart in this case.  If east ducks, heart goes away.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|kareno: Oh, can't be made because east can ruff second diamond - sorry, I tricked myself.|pg||

nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: is there a technical term for sticking a Morton's Fork into partner on opening lead?|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco says you have to leave the cards out|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand.  South preparing squeeze but spade return will break that up I think.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|toral5: @S will kill communication now|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it will but not after @HK at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: club to hand, @D finesse, @DA and the trumps -- 2 tricks ago|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|bjacobs: I'm coming round to your view ... but sadly, we will indeed never know|pg||
nt|algraves: I mean dummy comes down with a gazillion aces and strong 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: and declarer has a balanced good hand|pg||
nt|algraves: with heart support|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|bjacobs: But one thing we did learn from that hand is that holus-bolus transfers do carry a real cost|pg||
