nt|daman: and we're off|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|tlc: cant ask for much more :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w  have agreat spade fit  and 4@S makes|pg||
nt|daman: NS will probably bid to 4@H   EW will compete to 4@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: duh   maybe they bwill take the plunge|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|daman: would we all bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: problem for n/s  red against green  so 5 level not good unless e/w go to 5@S|pg||
nt|daman: my theory is the 5 level belongs to the opps|pg||
mb|5S|nt|daman: West may fancy his defense|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ady: usally yes     but east may be tempted to take out insurance of opponents making a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|daman: cheap insurance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tlc: so it appears this will be  -1..very chaep|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: in fact west got their first|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|nt|daman: he looks like a hero if the @H Ace is onside|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: which is not unreasonable|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: 5@CX in the CR   a HUGE swing for Lavazza|pg||
nt|tlc: no...5@H has some problems with repeated @S lead tho|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: you are funny Hedy... its good to have your around|pg||
nt|marlowepi: font know their style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've just started board  13 so we'll have to wait|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1C for me with that shape. seldom any insurmountable pressure where your major is spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: discussing last auction.  bidding showed minimum HCP but extra shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-3@C from Nystrom?     their 2N opening is @C & @D but with 12-15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: worst relay in the system...  laughter|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: an anemic overcall|pg||
nt|bobh1: trading on the colors i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Linda :) i love it and guess it shows..also fun with you!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed Marshall -- no reason not to show the real distribution  but some 5-card majorites ...|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|bobh1: so this is a stolen bid situation|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes even good pairs play "stolen bid"|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: most of those majorites burn to a cinder before they hit the ground|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel can't sit, can he?     for that matter -- can Nystrom?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Mustafa and Phil|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: in the other room East (Baxter) didnt defend quite as well as Sementa.  he failed to keep an exit card|pg||
nt|lml: the British Lions are first in the E division|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: these two teams had a tough battle earlier  just one imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT by W on a 9@d lead in OR last bd|pg||
nt|lml: I mention this because Paul Gipson blogs and he has been giving me a hard time about ignoing him|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: it is quite unexpected|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this can make if he knows the heart situation after queen or jack wins  first round|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzsv: nystrom, comment <should be some useful cards there|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobh1: S might have explored 3N as an alternate spot|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: I hope he does well... I have my favorites|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: i guess he can make this too|pg||
nt|hedyg: dpnt we all?|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont*|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: about the last board specs have been pointing out that they acution was different in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: West didn't have a chance to support hearts and it made it hard for East to unblock|pg||
nt|lml: yes the LIONS have a bye this match but that is only 11.5 VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H fixing trump, 4@c cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: VanCleeff comercial.  Check out www.bridgetopics.com |pg||
nt|hedyg: 11.5 is an usual score for a bye, isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Lauria requested a restroom break...  id offer to fill in but...  :)|pg||
nt|lml: yes but some people suggested the LIONS were helped by it... don't really think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol April|pg||
nt|lml: after all this is over I am going to start reviewing bridge websites in my blog.  There are so many new ones.|pg||
nt|lml: Van Cleeff has one of course and several others|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know if Van Cleeff is on facebook, bridgeblogging is of course|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|h3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: maybe bridge is coming into the modern era|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|xenya: 7 top tricks -- maybe there's an endplay available|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: N was hoping heart JT would be doubleton. but EW would still have the tempo|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kittyc: BridgeWinners is on facebook too, they are running a contest each day to pick Rosenblum winners in KO stage|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: this is actually going fairly well for declarer despite the bad diamond break|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry, silly of me -- @SJ is 8th |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: but what's the harm in @S first?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: thanks Kitty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: Bridgeblogging has a contest as well ... if you want to check it out.  All you have to do is name the 5 countries with the most winners|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never mind -- then 4 losers|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|tokay1975: declarar still hopes  to make  6diamond tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: he will have to guess @ss|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: he should though I would think|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now 3 down when he discard hearts from dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: i guess he knows about Sementa's @ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: from the auction|pg||
nt|lml: West has to have hearts left|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: unless West pysched|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: yes plus he can count the hand out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: 9 now -- S had 3 opportunities to get rid of that @H10|pg||

mb|3N|nt|daman: 3NT has it chances here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: great bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT opening   big balanced   not used much these days|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: can see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: that's an old Acol 3NT bid|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|tlc: as long as a heart's not led,, all will likely be well for the defense|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores |pg||
nt|ady: has 3 heart tricks  and 3 club tricks    will likely use club entry to play 10@S  to leave north guessing what to exit with|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: same difference|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play away from K@D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: not same difference  if North were to play a diamond  could give a heart up for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: North was never playing a @D|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||

nt|bobh1: zia calls it "last board-itis"|pg||
nt|lml: but the second last board is usually safe from my brain dead nature|pg||
nt|lml: and all entrants get a gift certificate.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Auken pulling away|pg||
nt|kittyc: full disclosure I work for BridgeWinners - they also have the swan games running scores embedded in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher DID open 1@C on 14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand here i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last set for the day/match   but other tables still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: yes last one for today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx to all, especially April who has done a fantastic job|pg||
nt|xenya: same result next door|pg||
nt|tokay1975: just 1550|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: I am only saying that because Luise was asking me too... sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow starts Knockout Round of 64 -- but we won't know the bracket until all matches complete today|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thank you all too!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: apparently they are in 6@D in the OR so it could be a push anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no doubt she will soon be doing lucrative endorsements for operator shoes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|lml: I am getting several specs tell me that they too mess up on the last board... makes me feel a bit better|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if our players can hang in for just one more deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I have trouble on the first board, usually by the last one I am warmed up :)|pg||
nt|tlc: al, wjhat's their systemic opening with this if they hadnt bid 1NT? 1D?|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like a easy 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|kittyc: do you open 1H or 1S in 4th? we would open 1S for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=a) INV, 4+@S  b) 5+@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 13|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: he could have treated as big 1@C  or  catchall 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm  "imaginative"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: N now sorry if there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: Duboin illustrates the theory that the purpose of bidding is to figure out what not to lea|pg||
nt|bobh1: d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised Lew bid only 3D. something to be said for bidding NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if he  made   5cl  they win 12  instead of losing 14|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lml: I like 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: if you are opening a four card major might as well make it the good one|pg||
nt|kittyc: also most play that 2H over 2C Drury for spades is nonforcing with 4Hs so you get to right fit|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good evening to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hihi|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: see there is an apolgy when you expect to make it|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: just like we were discussing earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lew not used to having ONLY ONE long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Had to join you, you looked lonely:)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|tokay1975: tyyy|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: play for 3N facing many modest smatterings|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: this was a real football game.  We started with Cayne running away with it and Auken shaky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil confidently reached 6@C|pg||
nt|tlc: on 14?|pg||
nt|andersk: the first board was not good for BRAMLEY, had a huge upertunety, and missed it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- yes 14 was bid to 6@C  after natural 1@C opener|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tokay1975: his judgement  was  very good i thk to bid  5cl |pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Anders|pg||
nt|tokay1975: note that  giorgio  duboin bid  4nt  and they were ,in 5h impossible to make|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: this is the last board for now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i prefer also  4nt but i am not sure which one is  better |pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobh1: the movie says that 6@d made in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: then Auken got a few good results and the momentum shifted.|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you April, great job @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: thank you Linda :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|andersk: I like the 4 NT bid too. But Im more conserned about the line of play from this room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now jack of hearts maybe? |pg||
nt|andersk: small @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened an Acol type 3N|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  if he can make  4cl tricks he is safe  thats why i thought he will play jack of hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|lml: I wonder if the score is correct in the CR on Board 15|pg||
nt|lml: they fixed it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set scheduled to begin in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bobh1: they just changed it to -2|pg||
nt|lml: 6@d was down|pg||
nt|lml: a big blitz|pg||
nt|lml: congratulations to the Rayner team and good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|lml: I hope I can be watching both in the finals!|pg||

pc|d4|nt|andyv:  OR returned @c at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores  for running scores |pg||
nt|andersk: S has to continiue @C now otherwise the @S can be good or @D trick|pg||
nt|andersk: or 4 @H tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andersk: tempting to use the Queen, but actually no need|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

nt|andersk: Normally a game bid and won at both tables, with players with theese skills|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: this is quite a thin game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mamos: but has chances|pg||
nt|blum1956: not easy to stay short of high level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: think 2@d is just artificial game force|pg||
nt|tokay1975: is morgan thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsv: yes|pg||
nt|tokay1975: ok its free  :)))|pg||
nt|andyv:  not to his partner:)|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|tokay1975: his pd  has 4 aces with 19  count and still his hand  cannot mnake 5|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even 4 is  problem that  cl ace in onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse, the defense knows what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: club lead probably best for defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: West playing 5@d|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: if, for some reason, NS reach 6@H, E will have to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  right conclusion|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: op, undo pls|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably|pg||
nt|andersk: South need to cover a 9 loosers hand, and he opened 1 @D, Impossible to be slam here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: very hard to play 4 16board sessions  in a  day with high concentration|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: 5@C was one off too|pg||
nt|xenya: the double is questionable perhaps but hard to resist|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|mamos: declarer could have made but double dummy i think|pg||

nt|xenya: i take it back -- the double was obligatory on the auction|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that didn't seem to be much trouble|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if a strip and endplay is the best line|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: amazing -- it appears N got the distribution completely wrong|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: he even needed no guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 2 lead a @C|pg||
nt|stc: and even tougher to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv:  I can only see one side of the screen, so there will be some delays during the Rees / Pepsi bids.  Fortunately, these folks bid fast. |pg||
nt|blum1956: may get 12 tricks now but will surely get 11 if North doesn't try a trump now|pg||
nt|stc: I think he will be happy with 11|pg||
nt|blum1956: surely|pg||
nt|mamos: double not looking so good right now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||

nt|funtay: http://bridgewinners.com/running-live-scores for all groups running scores|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to get @Hs right now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: declarer needed Hearts to make the contract so needed to use @SJ as entry  defence gave chance|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now North must pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: I am only seeing one side of the screen, so bidding may be delayed until the board comes back to this side.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would East lead from @dKx holding @HQxxx?|pg||
nt|xenya: possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Also, any alerts are only explained as per the West South discussions. |pg||
nt|xenya: the bidding seems to indicate N has strength in clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is comfy|pg||
nt|xenya: so diamonds is simply the unbid suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andersk: If @H is 2-2 it will be ok to play @S after 2 rounds of @H  The problem is: What to do with the 100% @D switch, wont help to run it, so only 1 line left: @C A onside|pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: Hi Linda, welcome back. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|stc: a routine 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT coming up|pg||
nt|lml: the game was a bit easier in the opening room on a heart lead and they made it for 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: we have the live scores at www.brdiegblogging.com too ... just push the big button|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sorry www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|andyv:  guessing time for S|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: well a lot easier|pg||
nt|lml: interesting deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|petepunt: 1nt would have been weAK  here|pg||
nt|blum1956: kind of chekback |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C is actually the best contract east-west I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Deutsch 152, Canada 142, Pinot Noir 139  - I must say the third-place team sounds interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will pull this without too much thought |pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  even less thought for E:)|pg||
nt|andersk: If you find your hand wurth an opening, and your pard penalty doubles, with a unlimitedhand, why do you take out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I just saw a declarer go down on a @H lead, so...|pg||
nt|lml: this is certainly a friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: i admit I thought Heart lead made it much easier|pg||
nt|stc: can make +1 with @c guess|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n 15-17 2c check  bak|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: All they are doing is pointing to the cards, no explainations are being asked |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n 15-17 |pg||
nt|lml: you may have some chances on a bad heart break|pg||
nt|xenya: a pass missing|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: I thought so too:)|pg||
nt|lml: well if declarer guesses diamonds there are nine tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: a thoughtful lead, but it doesn't help this time|pg||
nt|lml: without anything else|pg||
nt|lml: 5 diamonds, 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has several chances to make now|pg||
nt|lml: you have to lose to the @DQ to give yourself any chances of going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  does E have enough to raise?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @D has to be forceing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Its pretty unlikely to go down and I bet out declarer will make it|pg||
nt|andersk: if not he would pass 2 sp|pg||
nt|andersk: omg|pg||
nt|andyv:  congrats to EW... great spot to stop at|pg||
nt|andersk: How can this action be non force|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@C was a great bid preparing to defend 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: yes I have blogged about them.  They are from 3 countries all wine producers I believe.  France Argentina and I think Brazil|pg||
nt|mamos: looks pretty dull|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: sorry commentator sleepy.  Yes 5@C has 3 losers... maybe wishful thinking|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: even getting diamonds and clubs wrong it looks solid to me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: since N has no @H to return, he really has to misguess @C to have a chance to go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: no 5 card suit in S, but 3S|pg||
nt|petepunt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: or 11, depends on @c guess|pg||
nt|blum1956: both 3NT and 4@s easy |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: only one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: and even then...|pg||
nt|lml: yes there is seeding|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know the rules for seeding within a group.  Does anybody know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps because he didn't bid 2@d over the dbl?|pg||
nt|andersk: Ok people|pg||
nt|andersk: listen|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|vicky888:  difficult to go down, and Jitubhai is the Master :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lml: he might misguess diamonds to avoid the south hand I suppose|pg||
nt|andersk: When you take out 1 NT X, you have already shown 6@S and a weak opening, why do partner bid 3 @D if not force?  I|pg||

mb|1S|nt|gulyas: N could have been squeezed had he held the @SQ as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS 4-card majors|pg||
nt|lml: I think the finishing is important because you get to play the weaker half of the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: In this phase each bracket has 9 teams and 4 will qualify|pg||
nt|xenya: Open room is in 6@DX on the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: Board 17: in the other room, the Japanese EW got doubled in 4@S -- no overtrick, so 2 imps to Diamond -- somewhat amusing|pg||

nt|xenya: S clearly meant the double as penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think when you have specific agreements it's much easier to make decisions...E felt his Kings were not located well, hence the pass on a very marginal game.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|blum1956: but he needed the 1st round finess then|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: need good wriggle after a weak nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: often 4! and 4 card suot |pg||
nt|lml: yes the momentum can certainly change but this is a very steady east-west pair|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3@S was not a good spot|pg||

nt|lml: but actually diamonds is the better spot|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably Lev was too conservative|pg||

nt|andersk: 3@C is my choise|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: asked from 4 Y|pg||
nt|lml: he chose to open a lead directing club rather than his 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand was nightmarish for EW -- think we can expect a minus from the other room as well|pg||

mb|3H|nt|andersk: 4@H is righthanded now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this can be defeated and probably will|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will get to 4@S|pg||

nt|tokay1975: i thk this is not easy after trump lead 4h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: if they lead it|pg||
nt|andyv:  close decision because W has forced and doesn't know the quality of the E's hand...3@h could be on anything including Jxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsv: sorry about that |pg||
nt|andersk: Jxxx can be enuff|pg||

nt|yuval10: K@s of course, as Vladimir suggested|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|andersk: then 4@H is @H2-2 or a @S hook or QJ stiffed in @C|pg||

nt|andersk: We are not talking about what 3 @D showes, IMO it is just general force, and 3 H is nothing more to say, still 4 @h is makeable from W point of view, so IMO I would bid 4@H|pg||

pc|h8|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie declarer can arranger to ruff a Diamond in dummy but requires perfect timing and a rather fortunate lie of the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: Michael Rosenberg points out the winnin line: dummy reversal on a non-diamond lead. If a @D is led, you can engineer a @D ruff in dummy...|pg||
nt|xenya: because 4 clubs are 3 trumps are in the same hand|pg||

nt|vicky888:  North also thinking on similar lines... to rescue|pg||
nt|mamos: North has no business rescuing|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has doubled yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: can we get a director in the room |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S makes no sense from a passed partner - North does best to pass quickly and pray|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: got one thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this may be messy|pg||
nt|mamos: we dont have Convention cards so it's difficult to be sure but it seems likely North's 2@H showed both majors and that he forgot |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: presume rdb shows a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|stc: standard weak NT methods here|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is in trouble - he does not like to defend 1NT redoubled with that sort of hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vicky888:  lucky to get passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West may still want to talk to the director -- it may depend on what the correct partnership agreement is|pg||
nt|stc: No, XX is automatic|pg||
nt|xenya: but then E's pass is too timid?|pg||
nt|lml: East pass is very strange to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: may have been discribed as intermediate on the other side of the screen.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C sure looks tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: described sorry|pg||
nt|lml: it was a momentary lapse no doubt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT has reasonable play, but the hands fit well |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|yuval10: and 6+ @s's|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Should've been thinking about his lead instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: looking like 800|pg||
nt|blum1956: The innocent 1@d opening with the North hand would have costed NS a lot |pg||
nt|blum1956: as compared to the weak NT|pg||
nt|stc: Weak NT is war :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: punch thinking about the whole hand, not just this play|pg||

nt|mdgraham: practical 3NT. Gold won't worry about his club void  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is not easy by any means|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: upside down count and attitude. reverse smith echos. lead low from 3 or 4 with or without an honor. |pg||

nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|stc: grand not so good|pg||
nt|blum1956: the correct bidding leads to 6@s or 6NT - NS will undertand they are off the @sQ|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT much better|pg||
nt|tejjyid: CUrious decision not to cuebid 4@D by North|pg||
nt|lml: a heart shigt maybe|pg||
nt|lml: shift|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Although spades play for five tricks - @SK first. Entries are a bit of a problem thouh |pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's contradicts Bird's law|pg||
pc|d4|nt|reisig: See?  :) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: What do you call AKJ98542?|pg||
nt|mamos: welcome richie|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@c, and it seem logical for S to play @s to the J and try to "hide" the K, then play @h from dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: he doesn't know that @s's are 5-0 of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays J@c and K@s, it will make it a lot easier for E to switch to @d after K@h|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's hard to see how 3N can be made -- assuming E shifts to a diamond when in with the @HK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: lots|pg||
nt|reisig: TRUMPS|pg||
nt|mamos: solid|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Trumps for sure at IMPs|pg||
nt|mamos: eleven|pg||
nt|blum1956: very strange indeed|pg||
nt|lml: East can build a club trick eventually|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: the entries are tricky for Towsend|pg||
nt|mamos: scratching towards 3NT here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|gulyas: cannot go wrong in @Cs, so 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: nice play by S nontheless|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East doesn;t know now who has the @SK - so it might be hard for him to play a diamond if South (say) leads a low heart now|pg||
nt|lml: it works in some games|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and he will be inclined to place West with the @C10 - if South hand KJ109, then the long think at trick two was a bit dubious|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Townsend asked if they play Michaels over 1S, <yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: Maaybe North preferes to show a minimum hand first|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe worried about quality of @C reason for no 4@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What minimum? 3@C only promised 16...|pg||
nt|petepunt: good 16+|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes but Jx and Qxxxx are not the best|pg||

pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: well, it doesn't mater how you bid making slams, so long as you do|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Board 25 corrected, thanks|pg||

nt|dburn: East may bid anyway|pg||
nt|lml: well we do|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will bid that, probably|pg||
nt|dburn: he does have four decent hearts, after all|pg||
nt|lml: so if north passes and East bids 5@H what then|pg||
nt|andyv:  or simple 3@d:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|stc: however hard for E to put the K@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  styles matter.. in OR, N bid 1@d and S was able to show his values.  Both rooms reached same contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
nt|gulyas: they cannot open up both @Cs and @Hs for the defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think W's X is quite dangerous, given the fact his Partner is the only limited hand in the table, when he already passed|pg||

nt|yuval10: they started well, until Deutsch responded|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|stc: if @s played from dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: will -1190 be a good result since NS has 1430?  i think not, it isn't so easy to discover the 6@s |pg||
pc|sK|nt|reisig: I guess this isn't one of those ...draw trump and claim hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|stc: looks like .2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with Q@D dropping N should make this|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @ds aren't 2-2, this hand is not making so finesse for Q should not be an option.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: too early to worry, Linda -- this will lose to 6@S if bid in the other room :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 1nT?|pg||
