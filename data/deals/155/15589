nt|ahollan1: for multitasker  you can try to follow bidding/play in other vugraph rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|othered1: EW are Precision-based.  NS's system is unto itself, with things like weak NT, all 1-bids forcing, and intermediate 2-bids that can have lots of playing strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: 3@C will be in easy make especially aftr a dbl frm west|pg||

nt|toral5: and now no @C guess|pg||

nt|kareno: Zia opened the south hand 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all fantunes 1-suit openings are 1-round-force|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine north will not push to game, even though their overcalls don't have to be very sound.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio thinking at the moment|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: can be weaker if (5/4) @H & @S  but usually 14+ HCP|pg||
nt|jtr: Surprised Garner didnt express and opinion about 4@s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: light double...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: I would just get to the heart game quickly with the south hand.  Maybe Stayman first but then hearts.|pg||
nt|toral5: ya stayman is betr|pg||
nt|jtr: an opinion|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yvesj49: dangerous board for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Tez|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|toral5: but 4@H on 2@D wont normally show 6-4?|pg||
nt|kareno: If north hasn't got four spades, then hearts looks right on a known 6-2 or 6-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|toral5: and if the 1nt oc tends to be offshape,5-3 @S can be missed and land in a 6-1 @H fit:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Notrump overcall with singleton heart?????|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|toral5: but thts against the odds.likely is he has atleast 2@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Fantoni did express one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well... Fantoni expressed a strong opinion now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, the opening was stronger here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But even so|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: action in the 2nd board...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|kareno: 4@h would be equal lengths in majors or longer hearts and that's the end of this auction|pg||
nt|toral5: yes!!|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@H has to be longer @H for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: all players look away and think about the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: How many boards this round?  32?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I believe it is 14 boards.  All rounds today have been 14 :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Hey:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 4@s seems makeable.....|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of handling charges here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tez: i prefer 3@h ..looks like 2 down|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france 4@c shows 5/5 at least....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Tez|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|c5|nt|tez: 3..hi Yves|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|kareno: I'm surprised they are still playing 56 board matches at this point in a World Championship.  In the US major KO's we start with 64.|pg||
nt|toral5: yes:(|pg||
nt|toral5: is sementa heading for trouble?|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @D return?|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't want to burn his club entries.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa played a heart and discarded a high diamond, and it appears Greco discarded the diamond jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: clubs are now being played|pg||
nt|toral5: but he will end up making as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: You think?|pg||
nt|toral5: has the play been haulted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I lost the play of the cards :( |pg||
nt|toral5: wt happens here on a @D return|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: I think declarer is in trouble|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|toral5: final is suppose to b 96 brds?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if a trump back rather than the @h might have worked better|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, north isn't playing with open cards, as we are.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but Fulvio thought 3@c in Claudio's seat lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @s ace and @h for the jack ?|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, west played 5@Cx and north led trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and..back to thinking|pg||
nt|tez: all tickets to 3 down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|othered1: Systems of all four pairs are rather different, so it's possible we'll see few identical auctions (perhaps strong NT openings, excepted)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yvesj49: good new !|pg||

nt|dburn: that would be a remarkable effort even for him|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or trump|pg||
nt|tez: for appercut..pd maybe has 10 of @c|pg||
nt|dburn: first it isn't his turn, second he doesn;t have a diamond|pg||

nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|Walddk3: Re the slam on board 4, Wolfson- L Cohen bid it, Meckwell did not, and Gu-Lu bid it, Pasman-Simons did not. So a 12 IMP swing in all 3 matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Interesting that Meckwell, with methods not all that dissimilar to Greco-Hampson's, missed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Claudio thinking now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: reading his system ? lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fulvio and Greco discussing the bidding on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|othered1: On board 4, Meckwell had to deal with a 11D overcall and a preemptive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: meantime Claudio cards on the table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno: From a spec:  Zia would play a @d here  |pg||
nt|kareno: Could work!!|pg||
nt|toral5: only 8 tricks even aftr @C hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson needed to be escorted to the restroom|pg||

nt|sommer: they may bid the game now|pg||
nt|sommer: done|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: lol|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can Strul take their foirst IMP in this session?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: they are 15 down this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: time for some norwegian magic|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see how|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but for a change Fantoni is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east 4@H bid from west, facing a sound raise, with good opening bid and six hearts|pg||
nt|athene: easy 4@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is a standard queen, but it varies at times|pg||
nt|sommer: sure..it was E's bid, wich was tough|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose guess both rounded suits|pg||
nt|jtr: This one is a gimme|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad there aren't any statistics for average time per hand  per player|pg||
nt|jtr: Nobody has a sad enough life to calculate it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes would be high on that list -- maybe even higher than their WBF ranking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking nunes about nt range|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking...he learned from fantoni|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not the fastest player|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: well...he is stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lucky he is not playing with Fantoni|pg||
nt|jtr: Nunes can be slow too|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards on the table now|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was he that took enarly 20 minutes to play a hand the other day|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i had him 2 or 3 times on vg this week and did not seem slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in politically correct speak    they are     deliberate|pg||
nt|jtr: It all revolved around KJ9xx opposite Axx|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Boye is not slow, but he likes to think when he has a problem|pg||
nt|jtr: He eventually dropped the doubleton Q offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye stil thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but cards in his hand|pg||
nt|jtr: It was Fantoni i am told|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|caitlin: one example of few in favour mof bidding stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S may have been a strong relay and 3@S a maximum response, but I'm unsure about that.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asksabout card ing and the response is udca|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|pbmarstr: A suspicious mind|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|caitlin: stats show not bidding stayan with 4-3-3-3 is far superior|pg||
nt|kareno: If you play forcing stayman, then you can get more hands right :)|pg||
nt|toral5: now duboin has the easiest of shifts...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|tez: 10 trick now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: south could have risen with his @HA to play a diamond and get the @DK set up|pg||
nt|jtr: Now he neds to guess the @h|pg||
nt|jtr: needs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he has to loose a club and a spade... so no imps at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he can even loose some|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: then declarer has to drop the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: playing against sound opening bidders you could do it|pg||
nt|athene: since north would be pretty much marked with the @SQ after south produced the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but Meckwell open pretty light|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nt is 14 to 16 points by Meckwell|pg||
nt|athene: still he has the same decision here, anyway, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: you can't try to endplay north as you can't strip his clubs|pg||
nt|sommer: N MUST have @DK + @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: ah, but the @C7 might get set up - sorry|pg||
nt|athene: yes, ace and a diamond looks pretty good from here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: I taught it to Lynn Deas decades ago and she loved it enough to adopt it - she's done pretty well I'd say :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|pbmarstr: Definitively no Strul IMPs|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|caitlin: I know 2 way Stayman well......afterall I am Canadian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: I cannot see Sementa's cards, nor what he played|pg||
nt|caitlin: np|pg||
nt|tez: he cant get risk with @c finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pbmarstr: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|jtr: 6 was a better play maybe|pg||
nt|jtr: North would always play the 5 with 1053|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told, consistent with another source,that 3@S showed m 4-4 (or maybe 5-4?)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if south turned up with the @DK (which he surely couldn't) then the @SQ would just have to be dropping in north's hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: now north has to establish the @C7 or solve the spade dilemma|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Moment of truth is delayed|pg||
nt|jtr: To look like 105 doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes,,, Fantoni thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tag   you're it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he took a card out but changed his mind|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think he will guess right now. Why will the opponents not play diamonds now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm reminded of an acronym   MEGO    [My Eyes Glazed Over]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Answer: Because 10x in @H in N|pg||
nt|jtr: He maybe has some idea of the shape|pg||

nt|3for3: gitelman has the sort of hand where you can be pretty sure you can make 5@C if partner just has choice of games, so seems clear to show fit|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Helness asks more questions|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sommer: ..ya, but why prefer 3NT to 4@S from E?|pg||

nt|sommer: @Dlead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asking questions and Robinson talks quietly|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@Hlead from @S and @Dshift is good, but hard|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth asks if the 2 @S bid shows 5 @S and Boyd says yes|pg||

nt|athene: on a heart lead you would expect declarer to rise the ace and play spades right away|pg||

nt|athene: he doesn't want to run into a trump promotion with 2-2 trumps but he certainly can't afford to cash a second top trump if they are 3-1 and then be denied a club ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with @Hfinesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..now:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: signals in trump suit are asked with 2 possible answers given|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: N/S at the other table have had a fairly horrid time|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: the 1@H bid might itself be light but you would not expect south to bid 2@S on a known 3-card suit with no values|pg||
nt|athene: so you know he has something|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just hoped it was the @HK, reasonably enough|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco writing to explain the 4 @C|pg||
nt|toral5: fit leader 4@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H is probably down, but 4@S could be close|pg||
nt|athene: the defence just have to get their club set up here before it vanishes on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: south had better not lead his singleton!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|toral5: 4@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Or more - north of course will raise spades.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: 4@c would suggest clubs (if that's east's second suit) or else hearts.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|toral5: i bet @C ace is going away|pg||
nt|kareno: Whoops - there goes a club trick.  But there aren't eleven tricks (or even close if defense leads trumps).|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be down one from this point, though.|pg||
nt|toral5: as the cards lie,trump lead and @C ace was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco puts his cards down and holds his head between his hands|pg||
nt|toral5: and than @D.tht wd ve been 800 i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa is fidgeting and his leg jiggles|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr this lead greco will escape for a smal loss|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco makes no move to play a card|pg||
nt|kareno: Greco a slooooooow player|pg||
nt|toral5: can greco manage 3 @D ruffs?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Dismond has picked up 27 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: "Sorry" from Greco|pg||
nt|sommer: good 4@S and sac|pg||
nt|athene: north with five spades and the void in hearts doesn't want to double and double, because that will lead to partner passing too often|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@s might have been a close affair|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd asks Robinsons if his bid shows a minimum and Robinson concurs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-18 HCP, not 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: action heroes ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sommer: well, is down with best defence|pg||

mb|6D|nt|bessi2: in the Wolfson-Fleisher match one table made it while the other wend down in 4@s I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards before leading|pg||
nt|jtr: Great @d switch by Helgemo next door|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these guys love to lead from Jxx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i have friend who berates partner/teammates anytime the lead from unprotected Jack -- even when it is right!!|pg||

mb|p|nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|toral5: ?????|pg||
nt|toral5: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: for holding up the play|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C might have eleven tricks? five spades, four clubs in south hand, two ruffs in north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: woooow|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps not quite right|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe not so right :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: optimistic|pg||
nt|caitlin: woke me up!!|pg||
nt|othered1: it was right not to play 4@HX . . .|pg||
nt|tez: with acelees hand 4 nt..i dont agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fred back in the lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agree with yu tez|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c for sure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: of course, no-one is going to play in a mere 5-4 club fit with a splendid 5-3 spade fit available|pg||
nt|tez: np other leads|pg||
nt|dburn: why would anyone lead the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco choosing not to lead one of his bullets|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sommer: Boyd will see a small hope, when @DJ falls, but he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tez: we belive they will not ruff to @c ace|pg||
nt|othered1: with partner's double of 4@S, how could east lose an ace?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: I don't believe they will either, but if partner has the king of spades and the ace of hearts is not cashing, it might be a good idea to establish spades for our side and not clubs ...|pg||
nt|dburn: for their side|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly hard to find:)|pg||
nt|jtr: But they can get the @cs going|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: some spec says 4NT shows even number of controls|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzta: Boyd is emotionless upon receiving the bad news|pg||
nt|athene: well, 4-0 hearts isn't so bad - it means 4@S might be making|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he is not doubled:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd leans his chen on his left hand and thinks further|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: or rather his chin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brogeland led right suit -- just [in this case]  wrong card|pg||
nt|jtr: And declarer may not read the @d situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes cards on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D3 was ostensibly 4th best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back in his hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and......back on the table|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He probably know Boye has the @H king after some thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i should go get a coffee|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|toral5: but did he play @C q?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Now two rounds of hearts after club ace inflicts some damage.  But must play a diamond after that.|pg||
nt|toral5: this is 800 now|pg||
nt|toral5: same position wt v discussed on an initial trump lead by duboin|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes, Greco played a small spade and trumped it and then lead the @C queen!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|nt|kareno: So instead of down one, it'll be two .|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzta: More thinking for Boyd|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 now - cant take all trumps|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think the way to beat 4@s is repeated heart plays be the defence.. pls correct me if I am mistaken|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Does not help to hold back the @D Q if Boye has 4 diamonds then|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Okay down two.  He can claim now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards are shown|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toral5: no.3 down|pg||
nt|toral5: 2 down i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: six six Greco says he could not resist :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: repeated trump plays work, too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: Oh dear|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Might have the @D king of course|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see why he did that|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nunes should probably have blocked the diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: And neither will he be able to soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye asked YOU CAN NOT HAVE 4 spades isnt it|pg||
nt|jtr: Blocking @ds doesnt help  The defence just establish a @c|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Fatal spade return|pg||
mc|11|nt|jtr: Are we back?|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Here we are, both of us|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell asks about leads and is told A from AK|pg||

nt|athene: but for all he knows south could have length in both red suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth leaves with the director for the restroom|pg||

nt|kareno: For the specs, that is a duck hoping west continues into the tenace.|pg||
nt|kareno: The ten by east obviously denying the jack of hearts so west will shift.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hampson fingers different cards, but not a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: WC players rarely continue with signal from pd guiding them. Do you agree Karen?|pg||

nt|yvesj49: will coast a lot|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be pretty brutal.  And Fantoni judged not to go for vul game ... |pg||
nt|yvesj49: what's 2@d opening ?|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d majors..weak hand|pg||
nt|othered1: minimum 3-suiter with stiff @D, I think.|pg||

nt|tez: i thk..i m not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco stil thinking|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: somebody|pg||
nt|jtr: Another poor board for N/S next door|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: fantoni is thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead and inspired views could make this|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Strul needs desperately some good boards to hope for a come back in the last session|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on the final board of the set   15|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni stil thinking|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: All heart leads will beat the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th and final 15 board session of the Quarter Final follows after a short break  [depends on when/if our room finishes :)]|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking ... do not go away|pg||
nt|jtr: Tell him it will be more intersting if he leads a @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: director must give the keys of the room to the players lol|pg||
nt|yvesj49: pass ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Ah A compromise|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Or diamonds|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Can win now I think. The right diamond wiew and the right choice in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boye closed the screen asking some questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: about leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: boye put the cards on the table|pg||
nt|jtr: Claiming?|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no,,lol|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but an intersting ploy David      claim and let the opponents figure it out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards in his hand now|pg||
nt|othered1: east just trying to run for cover -- west could have only 3@H, I believe|pg||
nt|tez: pass is forcing i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i think so|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: 2nt is natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell inquires further about the 1 nt bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: But double punitive i thonk lol|pg||
nt|othered1: I don 't think you double them out in 2@H, vul, to pass them out in 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Hamson writing and Claudio reading|pg||
nt|yvesj49: start tomorrow what time ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Claudio asking questions...ans some more writing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they write cards for the family ? lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: nobody reading the bulletin now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lolllll|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So Nickell have closed the gap a bit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: we have music Greco says, as a piano plays in the background|pg||
nt|kareno: North happy to be able to pass!!|pg||
nt|sommer: difficult but makeable|pg||
nt|sommer: this makes it easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: nice weather in philadelphia but opponents are strong lol|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kareno: I like the overcall folks.  You must get your good suits into the auction when it's safe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa leaves to quiet the piano player|pg||
nt|kareno: I heard that Rodwell is still playing so he's innocent :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might well finesse against the @H10 at some point and go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell puts his cards down on the table to think|pg||
nt|athene: he can lead the @HQ on the first round of the suit to delay the decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell shuffles his cards and thinks some more|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: First challenge managed|pg||
nt|jtr: Next a low @s maybe?|pg||
nt|jtr: After @dA|pg||
nt|jkotor: Q@s ! @s|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Then the spades will be blocked|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he has to establish tricks somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking now|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can make this against good defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i am told there will be time penalties...|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: In VPs?|pg||
nt|jtr: I hope you dont get any Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: i hope not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: probably we will start the next session immediately after this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Fantoni thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lets finish this session first.. i say|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|yvesj49: very good lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yvesj49: it seems 800....|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: match getting closer again|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and closed match again|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|pbmarstr: I think Boye will have to trust in a defensive blunder|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: at the moment counting how many tricks he has|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe playing North for Ax@c is best|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: and he said Incredible board|pg||
nt|jtr: Then he can be endplayed even if he wins @cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: closed the screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ours is actually one of the closest matches|pg||
nt|caitlin: and slowest!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: asking questions |pg||
nt|jkotor: cause all Polish lost yesterday :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes looks realy distressed now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N has to play @C Q, and S has to play low to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jtr: He should see us!|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he was shaking his head|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep So are we|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: boye does not look to gather any momentum...lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: he said sorry and back to thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: stil thinking|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|athene: trying an intra-finesse in spades, playing east for @S10x/@S9x|pg||
nt|athene: now a club through, trying to get west off some endplay|pg||
nt|bessi2: a great technical play from Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will lead the @SJ from dummy next time he plays the suit, holding his losers to two|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd seemingly fidgets in his chair|pg||
nt|sommer: @Cshift needed to cause problems nowwww|pg||
nt|athene: squeezing every last drop out of his club spots - well when you overcall on such a threadbare suit you have to |pg||
nt|athene: sorry out of his spade spots|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Boyd silently counts to himself|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: restart time for final set is scheduled for 30 minutes|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: this must be wrong|pg||
nt|jtr: Because i suggested it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we finish 3.5 boards ??|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: PLayed N for 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now Fantoni thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|athene: now @HQ to king and ace, and @SJ, maybe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is painful to watch|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|athene: declarer's probably is he is getting a bit forced in diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but if the defence force too much all that will do is strip west's exit cards so he will surely be endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|sommer: endplay possible even for overtrick!|pg||
nt|bessi2: an interesting line would have been to cash the ace of spades play q of hearts.. ruff diamond and exit in trumps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tez: nice defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: is it over?|pg||
nt|bessi2: he can now.. play a heart to the jack ruff diamond and exit in spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: no cards were played while we were offline :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ahhh:)|pg||
nt|athene: if he views to drop the @H10 offside he can even unblock his @H8 and finesse the six :) as a kibitzer points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Rodwell still has not played a card :)|pg||
nt|sommer: can you remake the score, Ala?|pg||
nt|bessi2: the 10 of hearts doesnt need to drop.. west will be endplayed in spades.. he knows he has the king|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure his nice intra-finesse play actually got him anything because if he gets forced in diamonds it doesn't matter whether he ruffs with a small spade or a boss spade|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|tez: 4 down posible|pg||
nt|yvesj49: very often nice defence....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with these 2 players|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|tez: 12 or 13 imp to Zimmerman|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: Greco thinking to minimise loses|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good view.....|pg||
nt|yvesj49: @c|pg||
nt|passell: now 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Claudion in the tank now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: neck n neck now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: 3 more tricks for south - nice stop.|pg||
nt|toral5: a push here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ruff A @d and only 3 off|pg||
nt|tez: right|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - both teams have 37 IMPs less 36 for slow play fines - should be one all with four to go|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty Tez i'm happy it's the first board i didn't make a mistake lol|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: all the players are completely impassive|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Gitelman says humph|pg||
nt|xenya: this beats it i think|pg||
nt|toral5: @S ace and @H?|pg||
nt|toral5: helgemo will be forced to duck;else north makes 3@H tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: not enough tricks i'm afraid |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Gitelman asks about the original 10 @S lead, with different possible holdings which might include the @S king|pg||
nt|toral5: if he finesses he is down straight|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: if there was streaming video, and there is none this session, this would not win an Academy award for an action film.  The most action that occurs is when Brad Moss leans back and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: cracks his knucklees.|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: wait now Gitelman leans back and stretches !|pg||
nt|ritong: bridge is a little less spectacular than football, admittedly|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Gitelman sips his cold coffee, but that does not provide the answer and he goes back to holding his head :)|pg||

mb|p|pc|dK|nt|toral5: 4@H depends on the opening lead by greco|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: on the flip-side   didn't Brogeland-Salensmind win one of the big pair events in this year's Summer NABC|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: Thanks to our excellent operator for a job well done.  Keeps us informed on bids, plays and knee jiggles too :)  I love how you bring the room to life for us.|pg||

nt|toral5: 12 imps at stake here only on the opening lead|pg||

pc|d9|nt|pbmarstr: Ace, king of @D should be of some value. Ought to cue 4 @D|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bessi2: many play this sequence as showing a better hand.. raising to 2@s immediately with that hand.. but they clearly dont play it that way|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|toral5: beladonna told in his interview to eric jannersten:whn u hold 2 EQUAL suits,add up the suits.and lead the suit with HIGHER total.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this room has its own director|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h limited to about 13 points, unbalanced|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: Well, he can apportion fines maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: being the VG theater room|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: it all started in Beijing 2008|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stop play??   and as David says -- apportion fines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ohhhhhhh   you're big room vugraph    so started later than other rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: 15 min late|pg||
nt|jtr: It will be known who was slower if he was here all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: but to be honest i can not point my finger|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtr: You need it for typing|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: He was a fabulous player.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Sementa scratches his head|pg||

nt|sommer: 1NT is 15-17...|pg||
nt|sommer: agree with upgrade|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bessi2: as do I|pg||
nt|sommer: E's hand is more 16 than 14|pg||
nt|athene: this won't take too long|pg||

nt|toral5: he,benito and forquet..:)true legends of the game|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c can be made with the Morton's Fork coup.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's very, very unlikely to be bid, however.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i like to comment this sort of boards lol|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Oh dear, this might go down now|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: too eager to meet|pg||
nt|jtr: A @s lead next door gave a trick effectively|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzta: maybe not so unlikely lol|pg||
nt|kareno: Morton's Fork would be leading low to dummy's heart in this case.  If east ducks, heart goes away.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, can't be made because east can ruff second diamond - sorry, I tricked myself.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|kareno: I love Morton's Fork coup so much I named my trading company after it years ago.|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: is there a technical term for sticking a Morton's Fork into partner on opening lead?|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyway, let's watch Duboin try to make six clubs.  Heart loser going away now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can East be squeezed in the majors? Barnet Shenkin suggests that he can|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|caitlin: but will Greco get the ruff?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: If only east had a doubleton diamond, Morton would work :)|pg||
nt|toral5: east will be under severe presure to guard Majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin shakes his head no and then sits back in his chair|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Is there not a squeeze if declarer rises @HK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|toral5: CANT afford to cash @S.else no entry in hand for setting a M suit squeeze on east|pg||
nt|jkotor: but E can play @s after A@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: more sighs from Duboin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jakub|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caitlin: fastest I have seen |pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Declarer has communication hearts then|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Greco says you have to leave the cards out|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough hand.  South preparing squeeze but spade return will break that up I think.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|toral5: @S will kill communication now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jkotor: still gib wins it somehow, but after @c now, finesse @d and?|pg||
nt|jtr: Not a single game swing the whole set  Not that there have been many game contracts|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Now it will but not after @HK at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: club to hand, @D finesse, @DA and the trumps -- 2 tricks ago|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll try to ruff out the heart jack.|pg||
nt|kareno: And down he will go.|pg||
nt|jtr: 33IMPs in bits and pieces|pg||
nt|jtr: 37 now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kareno: True, Roland.  You need to look very far into your telescope to see that at trick one :)|pg||

nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|phil: curious; early matches were 56, then 60 yesterday....|pg||

nt|ritong: not that easy|pg||
nt|toral5: yeah|pg||
nt|toral5: not that easy to guess @S u mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean, even with a @s right guess|pg||
nt|toral5: why?|pg||
nt|phil: he'll be focused on 10 - with 3/5 leads he can't be sure if its from shortness or Q(J)97x - so he might play @h up, @c hook|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toral5: 5@H in hand,3@C,2@D,1@S and a @C ruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: how so, why? you have to hook @c twice and ruff one to boot|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Helgemo stops to think!  A first !|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|phil: seems a logical order would have been @cA, club ruff high, spade ruff, @d exit|pg||
mc|12|nt|phil: sorry missed Geirs ruff of the @cA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but 37-0   |pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: 1@H 1-round-force|pg||
nt|jtr: A chance at last for Strul|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 26 minutes to play one board, and to drink a coffee no time for shower lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: chance here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in france it's 18:34|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzta: for fantunes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, but maybe 12/13 with 5@H & 4@S   [as we see here]|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: At last a chance to get some IMPs for Strul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N= 5+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: now East in the tank..|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: director said you should be finished by now|pg||
nt|tez: in turkey 19:37 :) |pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the structure from here -- probably 3@H saying reject game try    [without interference]|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i bet theses guys will bid slam|pg||
nt|dburn: better let them use Blackwood|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: To be fair on the players time wise, all these part scores do take up a lot of time|pg||
nt|dburn: then, they won't bid a slam - if you make them guess, they might|pg||
nt|yvesj49: key cards BW is boring here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sommer: very lucky 10 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|athene: east bids 1nt because he doesn't think he is good enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand gestures on the alerts|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very heavy 3@S there|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S, declarer won't want to draw all the trumps because he wants a heart ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: ..exept with @Slead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Meckstroth and Rodwell still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told EW play "strong weak-2@S opener" so 1@S - 1nt; 2@S is a good hand already|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: this is the last hand of this set|pg||
nt|jtr: Few 'routine' contracts|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe 2 Aces out|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: thwy will be pushed there probably|pg||
nt|passell: 1100 here if dbl|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Hmapson is helping them|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: so 1@S - 1nt; 3@S is a very good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Philadelphia Vugraph Archives at  http://www.bridgefederation.ch/2010/wtc/index.html  courtesy of Yvan Calame|pg||
nt|dburn: they use Turbo, but the effect is the same - they will discover that there are two key cards missing if left to their own devices|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: in that case, this is almost forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Robinson asks about the 9 @C lead|pg||

pc|dA|nt|jtr: Similar auction|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Nobody doubled. Still a chance|pg||
nt|jtr: Standard Norwegian i am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: yes ... a chance to improve the 0|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: A decent slam in norwegian. Needs S to lead diamond ace. But thereafter good chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Nunes did not lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: so screen stil down|pg||
mc|12|nt|jtr: I am told a standard Norwegian slam is where the opponents cash 2 aces then wait for their trump trick(s)|pg||
