nt|ahollan1: 2N=Puppet 3@C   either weak @C or game force 2-suit|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 5@H is a cheap sucrifice, but will there be a chance to bid after 2C opening|pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|uni_cicam: dbl will show now 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 4@S for sure, but what if W has 3@D and only 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive, but i suspect DBL has more to do with @H than his actual hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: You might like to consider how many tricks West can take in clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphztb: notes being written on both sides|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: true, not enought defensive values|pg||

nt|swanson: took|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: curious. NS in the other room didn't find the spade fit|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S and 3NT look like that have about the same likelihood of making, but neither will be successful.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it looks like you will only make 4@s if you have the hand records|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: lots of hand rolling to explain bids|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, if anyone can snif this, South can|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|swanson: There is simply no reason to guess the 9x of spades offside on this hand.  Even Zia wouldn't make that play without the hand record.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jkotor: still a chance, gib says Martens could discard A@c|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but 10 from 102, yes? |pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 4+ or 15-17 balanced 4333|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: spades? what spades?|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@S will be 4th suit, than 2@S will show 4441|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 days ago Fantunes failed to find 8 card @S fit twice|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but 1H already showed an unbalanced hand if not 4441 than 5@C and 4@H|pg||
nt|dburn: Kurka perhaps taking the chance that Kopecky does not have spades - the only time he will is when 4=4=1=4 or 4=4=0-5|pg||
nt|dburn: and hoping that even if North does have one of those shapes, 3NT might make anyway|pg||
pc|hT|nt|uni_cicam: might be a lucky guess, 4S is probably 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: @H lead give some chances|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 4@s likely to fail unless declarer does something spectacular in trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs NT  meckwell use  Reverse Smith Echo  [when following declarer's suit   low says i like the lead   high says i don't like the lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: but, does E want any other suit?|pg||
nt|dburn: Rodwell may still not shift to diamonds, declarer's first-bid suit, but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Reverse Smith apply here?   nope|pg||
nt|dburn: ...he won't see much prospect unless East can come up with something in diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|uni_cicam: @C j might be an option since S might have 4252|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in most cases  meckwell also play  reverse count, attitude AND suit preference|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzta: Hamman asks about the bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c and 2@s after @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: a question is written|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: The defense can get spades going before declarer can establish extra tricks in hearts or clubs - not much chance for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asks about a 1 @C opening versus this hand by East|pg||
nt|jkotor: Consus polish team closed the gap on Strul thru 19 imps after 3 board|pg||
nt|jkotor: boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia coughs as he has had a achest cold during this tourney|pg||
nt|jkotor: what is the declarers line here?|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer will want to lead toward his Q8 of club initally - North could be dealt AK63 - but even then there are three club losers.  But perhaps North will duck with AK6.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Jassem continues to think|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe better to play for Qxx / Txx @h or Tx/Qx?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|c7|nt|jkotor: can have J@c in his hand from opps view|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|swanson: The problem with working on hearts is that there are so likely to be three club losers (in addition to the heart and spade).  But then, nothing looks really good.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=accept NT INVITE|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: even with 54 1NT was a better choice for E holding his 2 Qs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell holding @C length is just coincidence|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uni_cicam: only 8 tricks for declarer and good @S lead|pg||
nt|dburn: could be awkward for North, who will not know to play high if declarer leads a club from the table|pg||

nt|swanson: Video stream will be available tomorrow at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not exactly holding back here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: did well to reach game in both rooms -albeit a lucky game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jkotor: with @c 22 he needs only @d finesse, (1 @d on K@s, and @s+@d ruff)|pg||
nt|jkotor: *Czechs, sorry for my English|pg||
nt|swanson: The North hand is difficult to bid after the multi-purpose Polish 1@C opening.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: still, you can expect aggressive games ot be bid in both rooms|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: actually 2 entries to Kurka hand  [@C97]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 9th trick established, well bid|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: anyway, defense has only 4 tricks so a cold contract for NS. Much harder to bid indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was there a lead that could beat 3N?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: the McConnel [women] are playing 15 boards in their Round of 8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: we started the set with Board 16 to match boards played by the women|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: after a @H lead, declarer might be scared, but at the end he has a showing up squeeze in @D and @S|pg||
nt|rado: aide da spazim tradiciata az si lyagam a anshte se klasirat:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|rado: sorry private|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after @H -- if defense doesn't give @H [trick  9 with @D finesse] then 2@S 2@D 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise  @H honors must split and 4441 around the table [i think]|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: another question will be, how the bidding will continue after E will bid 1@H over dbl|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: this hand is an example that first you have to win in bidding, card play is just for wasting energy|pg||

pc|d5|nt|uni_cicam: +100 instead of -300 is a gold, Kurka bidding 4@S is the matter of a short partnership|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is great auction for partnerships to discuss    what, if anything, does Rodwell DBL say about @S|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: that is true, suppose 2NT is good/bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some say   denies 4@S, others promises 3@S, still others possible bad 4@S, and here --  just focus on @C & @D|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: dbl is now for 500 also|pg||
nt|dburn: the defence to 3@s was not accurate, so Nickell did indeed recoup 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: now it much harder for W to bid, everything can be wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Rod DBL -- can/will Meck sit or will they get to 5@C|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: difficult for both of them with two losing hearts each - not easy to see that the rest of it is solid|pg||

mb|3D|nt|jkotor: 4@d and what after 4@s?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: desperate measures- but even then 7 spades is so much|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: we can all see 7@S makes, but it is going to be very difficult even to get to six|pg||
nt|swanson: It is possible that N-S will push to a grand, knowing they are behind big time.  But the bidding is starting at a high level.  |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6 at least now|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|swanson: A big bid by Zia.  He was evidently planning to bid 4@S over 4@H.  But would that show another place to play or would it be a strong had with spades?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: W.C.Fields had something to say about water|pg||
nt|swanson: He had something to say about Philadelphia also.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: contrary to popular belief in constructive auctions Zia usually has his bid - he embarks on some psychological adventures but they are the exception|pg||

nt|warrens:  this makes 7, but I would expect both tables to be in 6.  we'll see if the preempt changes that|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: this is a grand slam if you're desperate, but it might not be so easy to get beyond game|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: do you and your partner know the meaning of (3@D)-4@D ??|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: sure we do, we will see if this action will lead to a right contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|an|dont lead|nt|ahollan1: that is funny if you're old  ---  maybe offensive if younger     but not meant that way at all|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right  Non-Lead DBL |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|dburn: but in an auction like this, it would also be scary|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopecky has a junior heart and opponents fit @D so possible SRT in S hand|pg||
mb|6H|nt|warrens:  N must be considering 6@D or 6@H, whichever would be clearer to partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 6 is safe, indeed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there's supposed to be another good link to WBF page -- but i don't have it :(|pg||

nt|ahollan1: women are in quarter finals -- this is round of 16 -- not sure how many boards played tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if North raises to 4@h and West decides to lead something dramatic, he might pick @cK - or he might pick a low diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oops my bad   last here is 29|pg||

nt|swanson: N-S are way too high - but there was little chance of stopping in time.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant make 4 spades whatever defence does|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia explaining that he can bid 1 NT with 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: that is why he wiggled or waggled the 1 @S bid|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: why @D instead of another @C?|pg||

nt|dburn: I don't think he did that - declarer probably won the club and played a diamond|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @DK probably confirming to Meck that @C are under control|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|swanson: It is amazing how often this type of situation happens - you have to play hard until they director refuses to give you any more hands to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: according to north and south, Zia has taken all of the tricks, but Zia just asks if he has 5 tricks andamman confirms :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might get this right - low from doubleton on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Zia asked about the lead and was told that his opponents lead low from doubletons|pg||
