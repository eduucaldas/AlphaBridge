nt|vugraphzsx: The Chinese ladies have arrived and ready to play.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|spooky: did he really make +3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: WOW! fun board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes, declare claimed 12 top tricks.. from Jansma... |pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: running scores here, as they get updated |pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades and a minor weak|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/runningscores/asp/knockoutphaseconditstatmultievcolours.asp?qtournid=835&qphase=FF&qroundno=1|pg||

mb|2N|nt|oosmanb: what's too high?|pg||
nt|spooky: 6 something?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@D there|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: aggresive lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Willie from NY here. Hello to all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: city|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Queens, NY|pg||
nt|peachy: I am actually not surprised at the lead, trump downt seem indicated, and leading minor is a guess ehich one she has|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Willie :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: I am trying to make the operator shut down but no luck|pg||
nt|peachy: pardon my typing :(|pg||
mb|3D|an|alert|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 4@S has a chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|alert|nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: I think Sjoert will bid 6@D at some point|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We need the open room up first with the correct score|pg||
nt|afulton: it looks like 4@s has a great chance |pg||
nt|sybarra: might be tough to stay out of 5 @D |pg||
nt|afulton: ah, minors are for minors, no?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh all,  I am off to the open room  gl here|pg||
nt|afulton: thanks, have fun Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting that 3@S alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant figure out why|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: unable to figure out alert explanation.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: W asking 7 -5? or just no to partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: only -1 Oos?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
nt|afulton: neither of them is bidding with extra values... |pg||
pc|h2|nt|afulton: Dirk pointed out that it will be tough to be unless there is @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well call me old fashion, north hand not an opener|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I wish he/she would read on the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: what happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I wrote a novel|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You must shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: because the score is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Please|pg||
pc|h8|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
nt|afulton: Martin, maybe that's why we aren't playing in Philly|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
nt|afulton: :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Somehow I feel I am wasting my time|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|rado: N-S use sophisticated prec @C , EW tooo in my memory from last days|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: still two clubs to lose, making this 1 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: OK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: or the Dutch equivalent|pg||
nt|pelu: the @S-finess looks ok - dont know @Ds 4-1 so he can lose to @SK|pg||
nt|afulton: (I was but only got as high as 20th in plate) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|afulton: Hmm... |pg||
pc|s5|pc|dK|nt|afulton: i don't think this was correct line... |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pelu: as expected!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes I think this is best. ruffing second one with 10 anyway, so you'll be fine|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: next|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|afulton: needed AK@d, then establish @s's before entry knocked out|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: this works|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: declarer might have done better to just lose the clubs that were never going anywhere than give up the diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: wd|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: so far so good|pg||
pc|s9|nt|afulton: only because @s broke|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: then yan just continues hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rado: part score battle expected now|pg||
mb|d|an|alert|nt|chick: precision 2@C, 6 clubs or 5 clubs+4 major|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double looks like woolsey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont have a cc for ew|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 major, 5 minor|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|pelu: easy 3NT to bid and win - I will go for coffee :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alert|nt|rado: W passed planning do bid later with bal hand hand no fit|pg||
nt|rado: many pairs use art 1NT after 1M dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: NS using a trash or scramble stayman auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: South showed 12-14 Balanced now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S probably a try for 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told there was an adjustment to score on board 1 of last segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: that is correct.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: so in fact netherlands may have 6 more imps than we are showing here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: You are correct.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|afulton: although @c would have been better on this hand... this isn't such a bad contract... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it were not for spectators, i would know nothing :)|pg||
nt|afulton: hey, all the VERY best specs are here!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: 3NT is a reasonable contract as well but U like 4H better, knowing that opener does not have a 4-card major, she should have xx hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: likelihood anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is painfully slow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: needed a spade lead to beat|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|spooky: this makes declarer life even more easy|pg||
nt|rado: trump lead was normal after the bidding, so flat board expected|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|afulton: interesting position... both east and west will be looking for ways to get to partner's hand for @c ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h2|nt|afulton: @HK |pg||
pc|c3|nt|afulton: and then another @h|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: compressing all defense tricks|pg||
nt|afulton: yep|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: spade eight beats this i think|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|afulton: not if south pitched @c... |pg||
nt|afulton: then what|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: for an overtrick even|pg||

nt|lml: it was the law|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure this qualifies but i like the idea|pg||
nt|lml: anyway I am all for bidding games vulnerable if you think there is a shot at all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you must undo willie|pg||
nt|afulton: Ming Sun opened 1@d |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: partner needs more than minimum opening or 4@S down off the top|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oosmanb: 123-97 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: SORRY  MELTZER 97|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the score is incorrect as the last 2 boards in the previous set were not recorded|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Add 14 to Strul, and add 4 to Zimmermann|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so at this point the real score is 53-115|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: but then maybe they make something their way|pg||
nt|lml: I dont mind it really and anything else seems sort of wimpy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: 2@S NO 3@S NO what have you got left|pg||

nt|rado: @H sevrelat hand types|pg||
nt|rado: several|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Larry Mori|pg||
nt|joest: now 1NT would be 17-19|pg||
nt|joest: what 'double' would be is somewhat more obscure|pg||
nt|peachy: decision for North - try for a major suit or transfer/show diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: New session Times 16:00 and 18:40 (instead of 15:30 and 18:00)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think the French ladies play Bergen|pg||
nt|larrymori: flat but with 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: would you know opposite your best partner? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I like this approach, just pass whatever South bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C is ambitious, i would be getting out to diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: easy decision, bid 2@C and pass any response|pg||
nt|peachy: Under WBF alerting rules, 2C (Stayman) is alertable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol, Stayman would like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|joest: hey there Henry|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|henryb:  High quality commentary group|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Real score is 53-115|pg||
nt|joest: now that you're here, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I missed a trick or two trying to correct the bidding from last hand.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: me either :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand dead flat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|spooky: unlucky lead |pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead :(|pg||
nt|rado: declarer should take @H finesse to make|pg||
nt|rado: 2@H much better spot |pg||
nt|joest: Helgemo thinking about a game try.  That might be debateable white with a superstrong NT behind you|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: there is something to be said about simplicity though, anything not natural alerted, but many jurisdictions have excluded Stayman from the alert|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems the down side of 2@C, leaves partner in the dark|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't know there was anyone above the level of EasyBridge who doesn't play it :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think North changed horses midstream, ie. strayed from original plan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe not|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: vul, she should pass 3@C and say a silent thank you to opps :)|pg||
nt|peachy: There was a risk that S would bid 3NT, then what?|pg||
nt|afulton: i thnk -2 was correct on last... |pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: may not even be permitted in France :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: not a great hand to lead from..|pg||
nt|larrymori: and implication that the @h honors are behind|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: nah, right to start with even establishing spades still one five|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only|pg||
pc|s4|nt|spooky: I gues Jansma will take his clubs now|pg||
nt|lml: probably interdicted|pg||
nt|lml: Apparently Hamman and Zia did not get to 4@S when Hamman opened 1NT on Board 20|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: zimmerman has chopped 20 off diamond lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: 3. and 5.??|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we could have exciting finishes in all matches|pg||
nt|afulton: more fun|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why this is not claimed|pg||
nt|afulton: because south on lead? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont care|pg||
nt|afulton: well, they cannot see all hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no layout where you dont take the rest|pg||
nt|afulton: Wang may not know won't be overruff in @s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: now here she is playing quickly and rightly|pg||
pc|h5|nt|spooky: just joking around probably, Jan is always happy to see the opponents go down :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|afulton: lol... |pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: escaping with down two if all goes well but three trumps off the bat would have made this a sad hand for NS|pg||

nt|afulton: risked all for what? |pg||
nt|afulton: should have ruffed high|pg||
mb|1D|an|alert|nt|fabsayc: same missed game at other table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was it not a low spade lead initially|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: Once you start 1NT it is probably impossible to get to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if partner super accepts transfer you may as well bid game though|pg||
nt|lml: so Hampton has pulled away a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but a superaccept really shows 4 not 5|pg||
nt|rado: some would have opened E's hand these days|pg||
mb|2S|nt|spooky: 1@C=12-14 balanced or 15+ @C's or 18+ any|pg||
nt|spooky: 1@D=0-6|pg||
nt|rado: hard bid for S now|pg||
nt|rado: 2@h, 1NT or Drury|pg||
nt|joest: how many commentators favor double over 1@h here?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would double, but 1@h is not so bad either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: easier to bring spades into focus.  A tad under strength if you're forced to bid hearts|pg||
nt|afulton: oh, do we have to always tell the truth??? |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes but vul game swings me to aggresion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: women lieing, when did that start|pg||
pc|s9|nt|spooky: 1@H is 3+@H I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most remarkable board in the previous set was 6@D making when one opponent had @DAx the other one stiff king|pg||
nt|joest: bidding hearts then doubling tends to show only three spdes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps one try for slam with north hand|pg||
nt|peachy: both 3NT and 4H are fine contracts|pg||
nt|afulton: "Here, Adam.... this fruit is wonderful... have just one bite?"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if this will be enough of a clue for wang to guess clubs|pg||
nt|afulton: maybe|pg||
nt|afulton: i was trying to figure out how to take 8 tricks with e-w cards|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|joest: this would appear to the appearance of a rare animal these days|pg||
nt|henryb:  on the otherhand, 9743 looks likd a 3 card suit|pg||
nt|joest: the 'natural 2NT" in competition!|pg||
nt|larrymori: no kidding|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|spooky: Drijver might double now :)|pg||
nt|rado: other room may present different bidding and contract|pg||
nt|joest: good point henry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gib made at second 2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: 3@h now shows some extras.  Garner might well kick it in here.  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosmanb: he's had enough|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosmanb: how does this play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 6|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: i see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 3@H 2@C 1@D|pg||
nt|spooky: for NS or EW?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: for EW|pg||
nt|oosmanb: declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|joest: this doesn't look like it will fetch|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he can divine to sneak the 9@s through...|pg||
nt|joest: they are in the same contract next door though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: snap|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Jack is too fast|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|spooky: he doesn't have an entry to finesse @HK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 7 tricks for NS |pg||
nt|oosmanb: same thing|pg||
nt|pelu: 7½ for NS|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this defence couldve cost though if declarer had A@s |pg||
nt|oosmanb: now he has extra @D trick set up?|pg||
nt|spooky: defence has 4@S 2@D and 1@C already... |pg||
nt|oosmanb: although im playing DD, will paulissen play K@C and @c to 10 and then @H finesse??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or give an open @H trick?|pg||
nt|pelu: but I expect that NS are dorced to give an entry to dummy in @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this can get ugly|pg||
nt|pelu: first NS has to find the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: what to play now in N? @SK? only DD u can play @S5|pg||
nt|spooky: let's say north plays @SK, with this @S's in dummy declarer is almost forced to take the ace|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: defense needs to be sharp now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spooky: @SQ, 2nd/4th through declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north must signal a heart|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzsx: done.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cute defence by Brogeland in the open room (did not matter though)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D10 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spade to the jack and queen and a *low* club|pg||
nt|joest: that would beat it if south had had the queenof diamonds with his other goodies|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes, the question with 46 would he just bid 1@s?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: so this one is heading down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|spooky: looks like it's made now|pg||
nt|pelu: close to make now - Play @CK!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Squeezes dummy if he plays @D first! (but still makes)|pg||
nt|pelu: max down 1 if East play @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant take @D7 - will in a strange way squeeeze dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: this board totally shows that defending is way harder than declarer play, 1Nx= by North on the other table..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen down, more questions by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: for those just joining us the posted daily totals are incorrect.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: we believe the real state of the match is 123 (OR) to 97 (Meltzer)|pg||
nt|pelu: I have tryed to follow the play in OR - but that dont make sense - sh be down 1 with that play - but prob a mistake by operator in play|pg||
nt|spooky: if Paulissen plays @CK now it will be 8 Imps to Meltzer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he will.. doesnt lose much|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes if its ducked he'll gulp and play another one|pg||
nt|chick: if the 2@S bid showed game values and a worthless doubleton, as I suspect, then S should look at the @SAK and bid the @CA on the way|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|larrymori: with all that?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oosmanb: hmmm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has to throw @S now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and can actually make an overtrick!!! @h now coming in|pg||
nt|joest: over a redouble, he might have to since jumps are weak|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|spooky: did south throw a trick now? (the @H?)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: oh oh|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: wrong attempt at endplay|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|oosmanb: -1|pg||
nt|spooky: so after all 1 imp to O rourke|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S more likely shape ask, anybody know|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: Some people have agreed that after opener shos a major, the other major is a slight slam try|pg||
nt|afulton: interesting... the lack of @d in South hand may convince Ming Sun to take @c finesse |pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are clues here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south did not bid over 1@D, combined with initial trump lead|pg||
nt|afulton: sorry, i meant H. Wang to finesse .. my apologies!|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

nt|peachy: There is always a potential for misunderstandings how to respond to Exclusion, unless firmly agreed.  Just "excluding " diamond ace from the numbers is not always enough of an ...|pg||
nt|peachy: agreement. 1430. 0314, how to show Q etc|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but ew can outbid them|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: even against a 7 carder it has no chance, so against a 6 carder...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here they bid game either way it seems|pg||
nt|lml: now if Willard had bid 2@H it would have been a touch harder|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be a push at 110|pg||
pc|h5|nt|spooky: Is the @SA never onside at you oos?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south thinks hearts agreed|pg||
nt|peachy: I like this auction better than the other room, where there was a jump to 6S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|lml: 3@H might have had some different nuances|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: guess my usual trump lead out of the question|pg||
nt|peachy: Well done ladies, now just bring it in :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: problem is after 3@H not easy to stop at exactly 4@D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: ok @SK = the 8. trick in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: interesting play by helgemo|pg||
nt|peachy: as long as no singleton club with opponents, the dummy trumps are good anough to suff three clubs, toss one on diam ace and take the rest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|spooky: good double from Paulissen |pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: 2@H least likely to push opponents (in my view)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: aggresive but will give much needed imps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||

nt|oosmanb: he loves the flop too, sitting right over that K@S and pd led A@C :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|lml: I like 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: well she is about to find out if she is happy to be in the game or not|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: so really this is moving along now.  They are a fair bit ahead of the most of the field|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell down 30 and probably out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Break time:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond leading lavazza by 23|pg||
nt|lml: too bad in a way I like watching them.  But then again that keeps fred geoff and the rest in it|pg||
nt|lml: and they are terrific to watch|pg||
nt|lml: I think Nickell lost quite a bit when two team members died, Soloway and Freeman|pg||
nt|lml: Soloway and Hamman had a very good partnership and I dont think Hamman and Zia have quite found their groove|pg||
nt|lml: and Freeman was such a terrific player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very true|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand the Diamond team is a fairly new construct and a force to be reckoned with|pg||
nt|lml: for a long time no doubt|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wolfson 25 up on Flesiher, the other two matches are no contests any more. Diamond and Nickell ahead by 1 zillion against Vito and Robinson respectively|pg||
nt|afulton: really easy to mosey into 5@d on sheer momentum|pg||

mb|2H|an|alert|nt|anton72: 6 @h will be good |pg||
nt|anton72: for BUL :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: new wrinkle here|pg||

nt|pelu: almost only a 4 card  @C-suit :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: needs @d lead to beat?|pg||
nt|spooky: Drijver needs to find the @D lead|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s may well be strength ambiguous if it promises 5 (and if 2NT denies four)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: wow Jan probabaly ecstatic at that lead|pg||
nt|lml: once South bid 4@S showing at the very least good spades North was getting to slam... seven may be tricky|pg||
nt|lml: so do you want to be in a grand missing Qxxx of trump?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a 7 you really want to bid, when 6 easy to miss|pg||
nt|lml: I can say this and you can't ... especially in the women's game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only in bridge world are grands common after opponents open|pg||
nt|afulton: get out the wrinkle cream!   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: double was hearts, hearts was spades, said the red queen|pg||
nt|afulton: anyone... the 1@h was also alerted as was the 2@h.... |pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: but far from over|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant not easy to bid|pg||
nt|afulton: thanks, Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this think is scarey|pg||
nt|afulton: that is true|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: indeed!!!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fold your cards, north|pg||
nt|afulton: they are about to end in the original contract i predicted (tho not this auction!) ... and south is thinking??|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: very long?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Stready long, steady wrong!|pg||
nt|afulton: ah.... MAYBE... they are writing all the auction definitions |pg||
nt|fabsayc: the longer i think the more i confuse myself|pg||
nt|afulton: that takes a long time|pg||
nt|afulton: WVanZwol needs to remember... her partner gets to declare :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: still thinking??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am having trouble imaging what this is about|pg||
nt|afulton: ah... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: general rule is 2@H is four trumps and a minimum with transfer advances|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: this is tougher than the final Jeopardy question.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: without the irritating music|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: is there a reward for slow play?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am all for rewards for fast play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in 40+ years of playing this timed event, i have never seen a slow play penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: If she is wrong, there is going to be a big fight here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although they are rumoured to exist|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: You can throw dummy in the bin, but declarer has enough tricks in his hand unless he gets a diamond lead (unlikely)|pg||
nt|joest: feels like Helgemo is ready for hearts.  I think Weinstein will stay off a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Gier will think this one over for a while -- as would anybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead, yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: very|pg||
nt|joest: if he hops ace, he will still need to be thinking about which round suit finesse to take|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni led a heart|pg||
nt|joest: and of course Weinstein might be trying to talk him out of the spde finesse at trick one|pg||
nt|joest: so there is a lot to think about|pg||
nt|afulton: i was thinking that it was more like 'The Price is right" (worrying about the zinger)|pg||
nt|afulton: anyone have any ideas about that 4@s bid?? |pg||
mb|5C|nt|oosmanb: needs to play on @H not @C|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: and he will probably go wrong|pg||
nt|oosmanb: its too double dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: I think you'll always play on @C|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 33 and you're home |pg||
nt|oosmanb: btw can still be home|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so she correctly I think bid 6 knowing that they were off the trump queen|pg||
nt|anton72: expecting claim = after trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i know is a cue bid, just have no idea why|pg||
mb|r|nt|oosmanb: South needs to not panic and cash anything|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is the right spot and well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: oy|pg||
nt|afulton: XX?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: oh my|pg||
nt|oosmanb: now @d can be played through|pg||
nt|spooky: I think Bas should be able to find the @D now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: For sure|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I dont see declarer making in any case, he'll still play on @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so he'll use @d as entry himself|pg||
nt|pelu: only @H back will now give 3NT|pg||
nt|larrymori: if he takes it and pitches a @h then @cs are safer|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: The end is near!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsx: asked about lead of 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: brink will be very happy with that switch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not much worse than 5h|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|afulton: from our specs:  1) South thinks clubs are agree, North is sure it is @H's, 2) control showings 3) shows ace 4) there will be a fight    |pg||

nt|lml: but just a small one|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Popov and pard are discussing why they missed the slam.|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what Gier was playing for there but it is now -200|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they treat every imp like a 2 carat diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: how many imp's does Meltzer need to win in those 3 boards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are very slow here ! even Fantoni finished already|pg||
nt|larrymori: here is the 9 and 4|pg||
nt|joest: did Helness really open a 9 point nt red? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass missing I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT by Garner rather, 14-16|pg||
nt|joest: 8 to Strul makes it 116-61|pg||
nt|joest: operator, can we change the 1NT opener to South?  THx :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please undo the 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: !!! :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: played a tough 6@d|pg||
nt|warrens:  the score is off by 22 imps, so O'Rourke leads by 16|pg||
nt|joest: I suspect Weinstein will just bid 3NT even though he has a tool to show this distribution|pg||
mb|1S|nt|spooky: Some though boards..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you guys mustve missed that board :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 16 lead I'm told|pg||
nt|spooky: 16 all helpfull kibs tell me|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 131-106 25?|pg||
nt|spooky: 1NT wouldn't be my choice|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh that's through 10 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, it's 11 from O'Rourke and 11 to Meltzer, so 131-115|pg||
nt|spooky: Thanks Warren :)|pg||
nt|lml: did they really make 12 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|anton72: obviously because N didnt understand 2 NT ....or und wrong|pg||
nt|anton72: or he just is tired |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thxs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How come you know the system so well, Jack?|pg||
nt|joest: he could bid 3@h to show 3-1 in the majors but with the stiff king that is a suspect move|pg||
nt|larrymori: the kingleton is usually better treated as a flat hand|pg||
nt|joest: b/c I play it with both of them and write their notes for them :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see, thanks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: I'm surprised that this 4@S actually made at one table|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 4@D is the max at this board, but they might sac again against the game|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H is @S's|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H=transfer to @S's here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was played by W as here, the lead was @s to the king and a @s came back..........|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||
nt|joest: my bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: verbeek had to pass 1@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: So 35 unanswered imps with one possible plus to come in for Joel|pg||
nt|larrymori: is this both minors F|pg||
nt|joest: we just changed that|pg||
nt|larrymori: lol|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d = both minors gf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a state-of-the-match 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't fetch|pg||
nt|joest: but I think 3@h is still 3-1 in the majors, so you be the judge. I had though 3@d was 5-5 but what do I know?|pg||
nt|larrymori: i think it is ambitious|pg||
nt|joest: I have no idea what 4@s is.  That one is a mystery.|pg||
nt|larrymori: rkc?|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|joest: 4@h would be that I think|pg||
nt|joest: and it would be double RKCB for both minors|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok, a couple of kibz confirmed, THANK you,|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it was a 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lets see how this goes|pg||
nt|oosmanb: It could make things exciting |pg||
nt|oosmanb: if lead is indeed 16|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they make this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 2@S raise was simply unsound in my opinion|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: not to mention that Weinstein has nothing resembling a blackwood call :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|spooky: I don't see a way of letting this through now..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: We love exciting finishes (the players dONT)|pg||
nt|larrymori: so this is a weak slam try maybe|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|joest: i wonder if they got a heart lead vs 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|joest: can come to nine tricks w/o working clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|oosmanb: simple defence often best :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of the hands that you should play quickly in this contract|pg||
nt|joest: this is a costly misjudgment|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: based on the misguided law?? of total tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|oosmanb: could brink shift to a @C after he gets @S ?|pg||
nt|spooky: why would he? |pg||
nt|oosmanb: would the Q@H there have been @D Spooky? instead of 9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he bid diamonds twice right|pg||
nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: plus the @D bids ..|pg||
nt|spooky: the only chance for West is the @SK onside, if South ducks it once, he might end going -2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: south will duck|pg||
nt|larrymori: here a @s shift is necessary|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: I bet he won't|pg||
nt|oosmanb: he has only 2@C, its not like @D will get discarded..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oosmanb: you win :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: and another costly misjudgment :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|spooky: and this table is way too late this segment, who do you think will get the time penalty if there is 1, oos?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lml: My husband in another room tells me that Nickell has brought it back to within 10 imps with 3 boards to come|pg||
nt|lml: he keeps shouting results at me|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|oosmanb: Not quite sure G, maybe the director has been lingering around?|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Oh yes they were 5 board after 1 hour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: got an early warning|pg||
nt|spooky: it has been warned after the 1st hour of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: the director was parked here the last board. that was the second warning|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: South upgraded the hand, range is 15-17|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|Walddk2: EW in 5@DX in the other room, minus 300 probably|pg||
nt|joest: would anyone run to 3@d or is that double dummy.  It feels double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  in that case they have to be careful.  |pg||
nt|joest: 5@d is easier to beat (and less risky) than 2@s|pg||
nt|larrymori: it is and going up a level guessing is asking for trouble most of the time|pg||
nt|joest: 116-61 the current score in favor of Zimmermann|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wolfson only +17 against Fleisher now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other three matches are over|pg||
mb|2S|nt|spooky: 2NT transfer to @C|pg||
nt|spooky: South might start liking his hand now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like declarer has enough spots to withstand any attack|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|oosmanb: checkback style transfer to @C|pg||
nt|lml: I dont have to I have a noisy husband|pg||
nt|peachy: right, nicely judged|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think a lot of pairs might be in game here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good stop but wont likely make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt and 4@S in Nickell match|pg||
nt|lml: the normal ways to play this hand seem to lead to 1 down to me|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosmanb: ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I once played a match up 13 with two boards to go, thought my opponents might be able to win it (based on my last two results).  they didn't play the last 2 boards well and got penalized for slow play, so we won by over 40.  penalties can swing |pg||
nt|lml: especially on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  a match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no one has to be careful unless and until the officials decide that both teams should lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: only two over tricks on the last board, not 3.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|warrens:  anyway, another pickup for N/S seals the match for O'Rourke|pg||
nt|lml: you discard a club on a heart before leading trumps and then you don't have an entry to make a spade play|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: easy contract|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|spooky: another minor swing to O rourke, and I don't see the gap being closed in the last board|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe that spade from dummy was an error, spades are hardly 4-2 after the double|pg||
nt|henryb:  this may be close|pg||
nt|joest: i think he might have escaped for one down if he worked hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|joest: Roland, do you know whom Zimmermann will play tomorrow?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosmanb: claim time|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West was declarer in the other room because EW play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: they may push them to the club slam|pg||

nt|oosmanb: And ofcourse Roland and the BBO team!|pg||
nt|lml: they might have bought it in 5@D though ... who knows|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT almost certainly an artifial game try of some sort|pg||

nt|fabsayc: sensible auction by all|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: almost no one plays it natural and NF any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for min/max and suit length|pg||
nt|larrymori: to see what kind of a raise 2@h is, 3 or 4,|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@H max with 4|pg||
nt|larrymori: with no short|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not that risky|pg||

nt|afulton: (present company excluded coz YOU all know that, right?) |pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: this is last hand of the set  3rd set of 4 scheduled to begin in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i cant slow down, no brakes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: definitely woolsey, robinson or multi landy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the double i mean, they are all the same 4M,5m|pg||
nt|afulton: north should wake up |pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how to force partner to show her major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: if not mentioned earlier  1N=14-16 throughout|pg||
nt|peachy: 1C = 2+ cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose 4@C would be that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Yes, many thanks to our operator in Philadelphia, and to Jack and Larry for commentary|pg||
nt|afulton: now wouldn't a X by East be nice? |pg||
nt|afulton: ouch... |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S actually Beth Palmer's bid :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|joest: thx, as usual, for orchestrating all this (at past midnight your time) Roland|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: Some very close matches.  I see that China Open is tied with Vito after 12 boards|pg||
nt|lml: Robison has 11 imps over Fredin after 13 compares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Past 1 even|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h a transfer (I would guess) showing 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S is surely only a four card suit which makes the 4@S bid rather over aggresive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: So semi-finals tomorrow will be Zimmermann vs Diamond and Wolfson vs Nickell|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|sybarra: if Simons bid 1 @D this is some gadget |pg||
nt|andyv:  2 more boards to go as a mere formality...my own feeling is when a match is this lopsided, one of the tournament heads should be able to tell the captains to see if they want to cease playing (only in the finals)|pg||
nt|andyv:  because the bar should be open by now!|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont know how you do that andy |pg||
