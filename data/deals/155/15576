nt|oosmanb: 6@D there|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: bid and made by both tables in Zimmerman match, Nunes played excellently I'm told|pg||

nt|oosmanb: And will he make... one of those testing Percentage play hands|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I won't even dare attempt to find best line, will leave it to Peter :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Jean (spooky you're -1 I know)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|spooky: only -1 Oos?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: in 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: actually the gesture was a little stronger...  |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|spooky: I know NS play optional blackwood sometimes, no idea if this is an auction for that|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'll tell you how Nunes combined chances on a @C lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|oosmanb: he won A@C played A@S ruff a @S, then @C ruff, and @S ruff with 10@D, now back to hand with @C to ruff to test @D|pg||
nt|pelu: the play in 6@D looks like @S-ruffs in dummy and @C-ruffs in hand - that is very close to 12 tricks (3 ruffs in hand)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: When @D dont break he fell back on @H finesse which works|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rado: N-S use sophisticated prec @C , EW tooo in my memory from last days|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: too late for that - cross-ruffs looks like the winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I'm being told @S finesse needed, I was just telling you how Nunes played it. And I'll dare say he knows his percentages|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead is @D8|pg||
nt|spooky: the auction might help him here to find it|pg||
nt|pelu: or a @H to take away entry in dummy to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|spooky: if 4NT was optional Blackwood, then 5@D was minimum and 5@H asking again i guess...|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok @H finesse not needed you win @D 5 en passant. thanks kibz|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this breaks up communication for that @H ending|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: south worried he is going down...  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Other dutch pair got @H lead and went down I'm told by Jean|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u take @HAK and ruff a @H|pg||
nt|pelu: but that is not normal bridge|pg||
nt|oosmanb: DD can finesse @S too :) |pg||
nt|pelu: will he take @S-finess in trick 2?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: finessing @H doesnt help|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I think he'll finesse @s trick 2, yes |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't know whats best.. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: then ruff two small @S returning with @C and @C ruff, then you're all set|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: thats why these guys are here... and were not :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: YUP! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: oh boy from south|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|bobh1: very strange 1@d call|pg||
nt|caitlin: catch-all 1@D  when y play precision|pg||
nt|glen: he would be treating the 5-3-2-3 as balanced, 11-13|pg||
nt|glen: and the pass of 1@H would show 3@Hs (usually)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why ni 1@S bid by N over 1@H?|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|glen: with a shapely hand, S might decide to try 3@H invite, but to be successful, that would need N to have a decent hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: S will clearly not pass|pg||
nt|bobh1: but on the other hand why look further than 2@h?|pg||
nt|glen: ideally S would like to X here, to show extras, but that would backfire with a pass of 2@DX by N|pg||

nt|oosmanb: this defence couldve cost though if declarer had A@s |pg||
nt|oosmanb: now he has extra @D trick set up?|pg||
nt|spooky: defence has 4@S 2@D and 1@C already... |pg||
nt|oosmanb: although im playing DD, will paulissen play K@C and @c to 10 and then @H finesse??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or give an open @H trick?|pg||
nt|pelu: but I expect that NS are dorced to give an entry to dummy in @C|pg||
nt|oosmanb: this can get ugly|pg||
nt|pelu: first NS has to find the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: what to play now in N? @SK? only DD u can play @S5|pg||
nt|spooky: let's say north plays @SK, with this @S's in dummy declarer is almost forced to take the ace|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|spooky: @SQ, 2nd/4th through declarer|pg||

pc|h2|nt|spooky: looks like it's made now|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Squeezes dummy if he plays @D first! (but still makes)|pg||
nt|pelu: max down 1 if East play @S now|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant take @D7 - will in a strange way squeeeze dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: this board totally shows that defending is way harder than declarer play, 1Nx= by North on the other table..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen down, more questions by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: for those just joining us the posted daily totals are incorrect.|pg||

nt|pelu: I have tryed to follow the play in OR - but that dont make sense - sh be down 1 with that play - but prob a mistake by operator in play|pg||
nt|spooky: if Paulissen plays @CK now it will be 8 Imps to Meltzer|pg||

mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: I dunno just saying|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
nt|lml: I might have bid 2@H myself|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|oosmanb: even against a 7 carder it has no chance, so against a 6 carder...|pg||

pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: 2@H least likely to push opponents (in my view)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|oosmanb: aggresive but will give much needed imps|pg||

pc|s8|nt|lml: so really this is moving along now.  They are a fair bit ahead of the most of the field|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nickell down 30 and probably out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: Break time:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond leading lavazza by 23|pg||
nt|lml: too bad in a way I like watching them.  But then again that keeps fred geoff and the rest in it|pg||
nt|lml: and they are terrific to watch|pg||
nt|lml: I think Nickell lost quite a bit when two team members died, Soloway and Freeman|pg||
nt|lml: Soloway and Hamman had a very good partnership and I dont think Hamman and Zia have quite found their groove|pg||
nt|lml: and Freeman was such a terrific player|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very true|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not a 7 you really want to bid, when 6 easy to miss|pg||
nt|lml: I can say this and you can't ... especially in the women's game|pg||

nt|caitlin: clubs|pg||
nt|bobh1: nowadays 2N in competitive auctions is rarely to play|pg||

nt|glen: redwood = a lower level of blackwood, here with @Cs as trumps|pg||

nt|caitlin: the better your hand, the slower y go, giving full picture of it|pg||

mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: !!! :)|pg||

nt|oosmanb: you guys mustve missed that board :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 16 lead I'm told|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 131-106 25?|pg||
nt|spooky: 1NT wouldn't be my choice|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oh that's through 10 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, it's 11 from O'Rourke and 11 to Meltzer, so 131-115|pg||
nt|spooky: Thanks Warren :)|pg||
nt|lml: did they really make 12 tricks operator?|pg||
nt|anton72: obviously because N didnt understand 2 NT ....or und wrong|pg||
nt|anton72: or he just is tired |pg||
mb|2D|nt|oosmanb: I'm surprised that this 4@S actually made at one table|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 4@D is the max at this board, but they might sac again against the game|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H is @S's|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H=transfer to @S's here|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was played by W as here, the lead was @s to the king and a @s came back..........|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Lets not name names, but I'm told it got a @s shift from North won by the King, and south decides a trump back should finish ruffs...|pg||
nt|spooky: Sjoert really busy, throwing in another double, Bas might try 4@H now, isn't that a lucky make?|pg||
nt|warrens:  the double of 3@H should make the defense very quick here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: West mustve been declarer|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so that the long clubs were hidden? |pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosmanb: perhaps an auction like ours|pg||

nt|spooky: why would he? |pg||

nt|oosmanb: or do they play it reversed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: he bid diamonds twice right|pg||
nt|spooky: don't think they play it reversed, but in what case do you need to play a @C instead of a @D?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c never gains|pg||
nt|oosmanb: you're right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: plus the @D bids ..|pg||
