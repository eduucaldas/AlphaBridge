nt|athene: double probably something like meckwell - one minor or both majors?|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: a @D-ruff = down 1 - but a nice contract|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C pass or correct, 2@H =majors|pg||

nt|henryb:  Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: someone will end in 3NT here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Peter :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Katz writing to explain the 2NT alert|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like a normal and fairly straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps all 64 tables will reach 3NT on these cards?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: either someone is legitimately squeezed or they throw the wrong thing anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell explaining the 4 @D alert|pg||
nt|athene: N-S obviously play a double of stayman simply says "i would have doubled 1nt"|pg||
nt|caitlin: probably puppet?|pg||
nt|athene: is 2@C a positive in diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: i will try and hunt out the NS convention card|pg||
mb|2H|an|shows 4|nt|athene: a reasonable way to play, especially when people bid stayman on nothing|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing less than 3 hearts or might just bid the game|pg||
nt|athene: i know that @S vs. @H auctions tend to end in 4@S but it looks a bit over the top here for EW|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bocchi Ferraro? i doubt you can find that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west can see that if he passes 1nt, north is sure to double, and now NS are far better-placed |pg||
nt|athene: if you start with stayman, sometimes your opponents have trouble working out they have the whole deck themselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks the meaning of his bid, to confirm that it is a limit raise or better|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: last hand it was west who had @CKQJ bare|pg||
nt|athene: it helps in the play of 3nt if you know that will be the case every hand :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not this one though  :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nhas yet to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|athene: sementa is wondering if he ought to pass his - he will wonder for a while and then bid 3nt, i would imagine|pg||
nt|caitlin: N has yet to|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting what south can have for this bid, given that he didn't pass the double|pg||
nt|athene: i guess no-one wants to get cute hoping for 4@H-1 against 4@S-1 so they just avoid the whole dilemma|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|athene: i don't think clubs can be his best suit - he would surely pass the double then|pg||
nt|caitlin: with 21 I would GO|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they registered it with ecats for this event - but not many did so i am not overflowing with confidence|pg||
nt|athene: anyway it looks like strong club, 2@C = diamonds, rest honest-as-the-day-is-long|pg||
nt|hedyg: Anna has not yet posted the CCs of this event|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C in Bocchi - Madala system is two-way (1) GF or (2) club raise|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: when 2 passed back to south he pointed down|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: surely N should at least correct to 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but Bocchi/Madala do not play a strong @c system|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: sementa decides that 2nt showed his hand and hence he has to pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ala|pg||
nt|petergill: Bocchi regards himself as a system designer, so these two probably play much the same|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that of the unbid suits, bramley chooses @CJxx rather than @S8xxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the Bocchi -Madala system S would not have opened 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps reasoning that he is more likely to find his partner with four or five decent clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n s nt 12 15|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|athene: but with a weakish hand and 5+ clubs surely south was passing the double of 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: underleading the ace allows south to play more trumps later if that looks right but it retains control so he will get the lead to cash out if necessary (e.g. if the clubs look ...|pg||
nt|athene: threatening)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing matters|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: we will not win land speed records here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mrt2000: correct|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|reisig: and with weak  4-4?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: when a person bids stayman with a very weak hand he usually has short (shortish) clubs as he is going to pass any rebid by opener, so south would know his clubs were over east's|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: yes strong @c and weak NT here|pg||
nt|athene: quite often when you are trying to find partner's suit, it's better to go for a minor than a major because partner would have overcalled with the major but not with the minor|pg||
nt|mr murray: he should not touch diamonds here as hand still goes bait if N and E diamond hoinors arereversed|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|athene: with weak 4-4 you just bid 2@H then pass 2nt, surely|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not|pg||
nt|mr murray: doesnt matter on thid layout|pg||

nt|petergill: The Open Room of this match also has the team names not matching the players who are seated|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Bocchi likes trying out new things - i know when he played with Duboin they changed their system from time to time, not because it was getting bad results but because Bocchi got ...|pg||
nt|athene: bored and wanted to try something different|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mrt2000: may do so now|pg||
nt|athene: this 2@H opener is definitely a bit different|pg||

nt|gluckenval: sta inciuciando con te ? lolllll.... mica gli ho detto che sei una ragazza impegnata... forse dovevo ? :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: the teamnames are reversed on the scoreboard :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s pointed down when bid 2 h|pg||
nt|athene: but to lead a heart from Qx does mean you have to play partner for the absolute outer limits of what he can have and not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 11-15 both minors|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S natural and forcing, I think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|vugraphztb: Yeung scratching his head, not knowing how many times he needs to rebid his 3 points|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asking for a review of the bidding before he leads|pg||
nt|athene: of course this is trivial with 2-2 trumps but declarer will be thinking about worse breaks|pg||
nt|mrt2000: v true|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you cashed two hearts and the queen didn't fall, you would be badly placed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: as you are going to lose the lead in clubs or diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: and the defender with the @HQ might cash it and leave you very short of tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so you might duck a diamond first perhaps|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d9|nt|athene: how would 5@C fare?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: the club switch was good for the defence - now declarer can't take advantage of 3-3 diamonds to get a club away from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: which might be a very useful play if it turned out someone had an annoying @HQxx|pg||
nt|reisig: Any bets on the result?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can possibly go down with @HQx with west|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 4|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bet -50|pg||
nt|caitlin: making|pg||
nt|athene: you think the defence have been deceptive in clubs?|pg||
nt|reisig: Yup|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer will place west with three clubs|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible the small club switch from @CQx might muddy the waters|pg||
nt|athene: if think they will find a heart lead you might prefer to try 5@C|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|athene: ok, this looks slightly worrying|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room surely it's going to go 1@D - @S and east will get a chance to bid 2@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|caitlin: yessssssss|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|reisig: Have I EVER been wrong?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: in the other room they didn't get the early club shift so i assume declarer indeed got his club pitch on the diamond|pg||

nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|athene: declarer was playing west for 6-1-3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he had shown hearts and spades so west decided this was a good shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even 1@D and 1@S from West -Pas - 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: he also picked the trumps though and ducked to the bare ace first time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: in which case with diamonds 3-3 he only needs one ruff anyway so he can cater for 3-1 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes west might bid 1 or 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|caitlin: mad.....new laptop frozen board|pg||
nt|petergill: William is right , with the 1@S bid at the other table being by West, North passing and east bidding 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: that's sort of unlucky - because often in that situation you are forced to play for 2-2 trumps as you need two ruffs anyway|pg||

mb|2S|nt|reisig: Thx David :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl does seem best - can always bid 2@s over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 1nt is typically t/o of hearts but east is so strong, he thinks he can handle the auction|pg||
nt|athene: some play this sequence as constructive, so they have to just transfer to spades (as in the other room)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: EW plays this as 5/8|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|peachy: Yes. Game force with 5 spades and 4 hearts. Had the major lengths been the other way, bids 3S|pg||
nt|01molaire: ý  believe  missclick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|01molaire: he   can    make   it|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the players have requested that I not click on the bid until the board is passed under the screen and I sometimes miss passes.  Pls keep me on my toes-lol|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer likely weighing his plan|pg||
nt|hussein2: Ahmady might bid something|pg||
nt|athene: well, if 2@S is constructive, east has a game bid with all those major-suit cards and a side ace|pg||

pc|d4|nt|reisig: For this hand ...get some ice -- have a drink :)|pg||
nt|athene: several kibitzers are suggesting that ducking the first spade might have been a better move, tactically - indeed that's what declarer did in the other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: I predict 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: by covering the spade you force west to switch|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt easier than 4@S here - often the way with a 4333 facing a 5-card major|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Bill i checked the movie again and he had 8 tricks for 2@s= last board|pg||

nt|athene: it's exactly 90 degrees off correct|pg||
nt|athene: west got a little luck in the other room to strike a 4-4 fit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Conservative pass of the weak jump by Guido Ferraro, vul at imps. |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H "semi positive", showing the weak-2 he wanted to open first time :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Norberto Bocchi has a very good hand for his weak jump|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c is 16+|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess 1@d would be weak |pg||
nt|athene: at any other vulnerability, lacking a weak-2@H, i think people would open that north hand 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: missed 1st two tricks |pg||
nt|athene: i would certainly be a bit worried about bidding 2@H facing a strong club - you have a pretty good hand|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: Could well be jitters, playing on vugraph and knowing how formidable the opposing team is|pg||
nt|peachy: formidable, in the best of sense of course|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz says that the auction 1C p 1D p 1 NT he might have 4 of a major|pg||
nt|pelu: np 11 tricks for NS (or 12)|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxxxx  and out from North being enough for a fair vulnerable game at imps, South could have done more. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: will be an easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: nine easy tricks once he knocks out the spade - will he get something going against west in the minor suits to make more?|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: 10 I will change it later|pg||
nt|hussein2: nice shift|pg||
nt|athene: with 4hcp facing a strong notrump i would have thought pass was the normal action - it's not that you are really scared of playing 1nt|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer has nice spot cards in all non-club suits, so again no imminent danger in any suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|mr murray: he did but this is goingto turn out oik on the spade lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: declarer wants to play spades before diamonds, to protect the @HAQ, i think|pg||
nt|hussein2: but @d produces 4 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator. THat is a common style in the US, where 2/1 is rather prominent as system. Opener could even have both 4-card majors for 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|peachy: Even when not playing 2/1, some play that opening 1C and next bidding a major guarantees 4+ clubs.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hussein2: also N might play @c after winning @d ace|pg||
pc|s3|nt|reisig: 4@s might fail...if that's the contract|pg||
nt|athene: well, now he *could* make an overtrick by ducking a club then cashing the @CA and playing @SA, spade to endplay east|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why he should do any of those things|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests that it would have been better to start the spades leading the ten from hand - but that won't look so clever if west has the singleton king|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|nt|athene: just nine tricks will do nicely|pg||
nt|athene: in fact when you play 3nt with a 5-3 major fit you WANT to make nine tricks rather than ten|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 4 was 110 to EW, making 8 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C ghestem|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Ala|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: the advantages of playing ghestem this way (where your 3@C bid never has clubs) are twofold:-|pg||
nt|athene: firstly you can bid it on very strong hands with no fear you will be left there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: secondly less will be known about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|reisig: PLUS ...partner must play the hands|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 5: South perhaps passed 2@H due to his minimum points and flat hand, instead of counting likely tricks in 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 imps on bd 3 where Q@H was led vs 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Katz asks whether the 1S bid shows 4 or 5 and \yeung responds 5|pg||
nt|reisig: except here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 imps to Lavazza ofc|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: several kibitzers are asking about ghestem vs. michaels|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: N was not happy with his pass|pg||
nt|athene: basically it's a Good Thing to identify both your suits explicitly rather than just showing e.g. "hearts and a minor"£|pg||
nt|athene: it means your partner is much better-placed|pg||
nt|athene: whether that is worth giving up a natural 3@C overcall is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: there are many top pairs who feel it isn't|pg||
nt|caitlin: here yes, typically not so|pg||
nt|athene: it's all very well doubling these artificial overcalls to show "cards" or even "a penalty double of one of their suits"|pg||
nt|athene: but you have to discuss follow-ups|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: S thinking|pg||
nt|athene: in particular, is pass forcing, and what does double mean?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same as w ubusual NT but not NICHAELS|pg||

nt|anton72: just for the records ...... who leading now..... in small table Bramley 12 ( Dark Blue color ) ....where is a player names with Dark Blue are colored Lavazza,s players ..... so ...|pg||
nt|anton72: ...Which team really lead now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|athene: south must have been really really nervous doubling there, since he has NO defence|pg||

nt|athene: although it isn't a penalty pass|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|peachy: E 2D artificial, though he happensa to also have diamonds.  It is either 4th suit, or a checkback bid, depending on system]|pg||
nt|mr murray: If wrong seated someone will catch hell :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: @SJ lead in the other room talked declarer out of the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: that was a sneaky thing to do|pg||
nt|petergill: and without the weak 2@H, North will lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is artificial showing a 6-4, with 3@C asking?|pg||

nt|athene: or maybe 2nt is any game force|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: w thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4NT invites slam, and with a six-card suit, E is happy to oblige (I would, anyway...right ot wrong)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz is pondering his response|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Katz sneezed, we said bless you, and now he starts his thinking over again|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung is asking about the 4 NT bid|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: i'm told 3@D has shown 6@S-4@D, which seems logical|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In 4@S, a spade to the queen picks up Jx in South, whereas a spade to the queen does not pick up Kx in south, so low to queen is best. |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a spade to the ten doesn't work against @SKx with south, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: favorable club lie, hearts run, and NT also right sided.  Not a really cold one, but I think I would accept|pg||
nt|petergill: West has no club stopper, so they are headed for 4@s or 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: unless you can get a trump coup going|pg||
nt|mr murray: very well done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztb: Katz tells Nickell that he will probably make 7|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: East (reasonably enough) took West's initial response to show something, not nothing|pg||
nt|athene: advance cue-bids are a nightmare - not only are they impossible to read when they come up, but they infect other auctions too|pg||
nt|athene: true, most of the fault lies with the 1NT response|pg||
nt|hussein2: Well played also|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: half time,  slight break in action here|pg||
nt|athene: most top pairs have revised the standard sequences after jacoby 2nt or the equivalent but everyone has different methods so it's hard to comment|pg||

nt|hedyg: you have great pds :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12:2 to Lavazza|pg||
nt|mr murray: quick smokde break|pg||
nt|athene: flannery start in the other room but NS still got into the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|hedyg: but bd 4 needs correcting|pg||
nt|pelu: or 12-7|pg||
nt|petergill: or Lavazza 12 Bramley 7 when Bd 4 is corrected|pg||
nt|athene: in fact the flannery opener might have made it easier for north as he could double, clearly showing minors (east showed 4@S 5@H)|pg||
nt|mr murray: not easy to beat 3n/t n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: is this the "other" version of ghestem?|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|reisig: Hard to Pass|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i just checked NS convention card|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C = black suits|pg||
nt|athene: another 2nt rebid to show a 6-4 - but this one is more limited as to HCP|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphztb: both N-S players are shown a downward motion at the 3@h bid, showing that it is a weak 2@H opening|pg||
nt|athene: since NS are strong clubbers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bramley had a tough battle to take the 4th qualifying spot in Group A, overtaking the strong Payen team on the last day|pg||
nt|mr murray: my thinking on these hands is when opponent on my right opens 1 hearts and I have kqx I upgrade it to akx and bid accordingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks about leads and is told standard or 4th best|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H is indeed there but i don't expect many people to be bidding it|pg||
nt|athene: what with the new drug testing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok so having espoused the advantages of not bidding clubs with clubs, it's only fair that we see the other side of the story|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT in the strong club system is a spare bid which can have a special meaning assigned to it|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ lead might give you some problems in 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south's hearts are nice, certainly|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|pelu: on board 5 63 x 4@H +1 - and the 2@H here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||

nt|othered1: But declarer likely will take more normal @C play|pg||
nt|iceking: or it looks like the % play but as we all know Duboin isnt human so he might well make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Duboin moves his fingers back and forth|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed he might think W cant have much more|pg||
nt|othered1: West has shown up with a bu nch of high cards, which might influence south's choice|pg||
nt|iceking: so if W has @C he would have overcalled 1nt if he had @S Honour also |pg||
nt|vugraphzta: Bramley is motionless|pg||

nt|hedyg: as soon as Ala can fix bd 4 score Bramley will take the lead|pg||
nt|athene: it was hard for east to find the spade switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the @HQ and @HJ could have been swapped|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|caitlin: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it might look as though west went a bit quietly there, with quite a few points facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't expect his @HK to be worth much|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when opps have lots of shape and black suits|pg||
nt|athene: and he doesn't have a stack in either black suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the game could easily be making|pg||
nt|athene: another point is that NS chose to bid game - they weren't pushed into it|pg||
nt|athene: as a passed hand, you can use double to show some interesting hand over 1nt|pg||
nt|mr murray: they opened flannery in open room. surely w leads a spade from j10x rather than a heart with xxx. I think:) I have been known to be wrong a time or two or three :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: maybe 5minor 4major or something - whatever you can't show with your normal methods|pg||
nt|petergill: like 5minor and 4major, for example?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and in that case, usually, you want some sort of surprise to double|pg||
nt|athene: that might be just the ticket here :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C majors and south's double just showing a good hand i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes a multilandy X works if you play that|pg||
nt|athene: no convenient dummy entry so declarer will just launch diamonds from hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: The undertricks are not vul - if EW choose to play clubs from the top|pg||
nt|athene: with two suits wide open, declarer might just try to steal one diamond then cash his @SAKQ and give up|pg||
nt|athene: this is a harder problem at MP - judging exactly how much to try to get away with|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: the italians seem to use double in this way a lot|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: no point trying to battle your way to dummy - the finesse is probably wrong anyway :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus 100 (avoid minus 150) is usually the aim at matchpoints|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell thx Katz for his hand, says it is too nice, and lays down his hand|pg||
nt|athene: whereas elsewhere we would be a bit surprised to see double with primary support for one of partner's suits|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: Other room opened 3C so spade fit never found. Here, it was not found either because the club suit is much too pretty to not bid.  However, over 2H, North might have considered 2S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: yes, -100 beats a lot of partscores their way|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@D not smith echo here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: no, he is going for it|pg||
nt|athene: this is one area of cardplay where you notice a big difference between beginners and experts - beginners really want to take their finesses so they won't tackle a suit like AQJ10xx ...|pg||
nt|athene: from hand, even if it means giving up a whole bunch of controls and tempi to get to dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: everyone is looking down at the table|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: but north simply pass|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have overcalled 1NT, with such a bad @H suit, but the Italian style is not to have 5M in 1NT openers or overcalls|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|twcho: exactly same bidding as OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H is touch and go, I think|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|reisig: If you look at all the finesses ..yes|pg||
nt|athene: i guess west doesn't fancy the 3-level facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: the operator in the OR is confirming the result with the players each board before entering it|pg||
nt|petergill: Ruffing a @D exposes four trump losers as the cards lie, so setting up clubs is best|pg||
nt|athene: even if you run into club ruffs you hope it will cost the defender his natural trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @D switch is best, to attack dummy's trumps. Hard to visualize this, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt some sort of ingbermann over the reverse?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: I am not sure I could have forced myself to pass, vulnerable IMPs, but I just have to re-train myself, because Hamman also passed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: it seems logical on the basis that declarer didn't try to set up a diamond ruff himself|pg||

nt|mr murray: hard to beat if at all possible|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 might turn out to be a big card here|pg||

nt|mr murray: heart king onside big card|pg||

nt|mr murray: club lead :)|pg||
nt|hussein2: yeah 3114|pg||
nt|mr murray: new leader|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will simply duck diamonds and if the defence play too many they will suddenly find diamonds are not their suit at all|pg||
nt|hussein2: this lead really costed Murray|pg||
nt|mr murray: big time|pg||
nt|athene: the defence's best chance is to attack declarer's communications with a spade lead, maybe|pg||
nt|mr murray: turned out to be worst lead possible|pg||
nt|athene: now he might have to get the hearts right to make|pg||
nt|mr murray: happens sometimes|pg||
nt|mr murray: other times it wouldnt be so costly|pg||
nt|athene: diamond shift now probably gets ducked to the jack and a spade from west, say|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|athene: it's a bit unlucky to find @CAK9x in a hand which has shown 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||

nt|hussein2: Yeah, @c lead sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|mr murray: faster please|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he would finesse the @C9 if it came down to that i guess|pg||
nt|mr murray: I wanna be around to see the finish|pg||
nt|mr murray: Is there time alloted for naps? :)|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead in the other room and declarer went for the double heart finesse, which was all very bad|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Bart Bramley almost won the Bernasconi competition to try to determine the world's best card player, the last time it was held (Michael Rosenberg won from Bramley and Balicki)|pg||
nt|hussein2: double @H finess should be the %play with some @s entries|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a clear-cut hand to bid or play|pg||
nt|athene: one point worth a mention is that neither east player took his @SA on the first round of the suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: true :) maybe EW try to live by the sword when NV and avoid dying by the sword when vul :)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: but with 5-7 that's really evil|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually it seems to be a matter of finance (as usual)|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|vugraphztb: Chiu asks about bid and is told that it is strong|pg||
nt|athene: fortunately Duboin isn't evil - he opens his longer suit!|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h|pg||
nt|mr murray: forgot :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: Pietro worked on it till his last day|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|twcho: OR east Patrick Huang never mentioned his trunky solid @s suit|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is ok on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pelu: remember board No 7 where NS was in 6@D  the most normal result at the 64 tables are S in 2-3 @HsX - 500-800-1100! so even 3@D making would be belove the average :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but people have a habit of leading clubs on these auctions|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphztb: Nickell takes out a bidding card, puts it back and pulls out 3 @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: reminder for specs, result on bd 4 needs to be corrected |pg||
nt|pelu: Feldman in CR also in 2@hx|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C obviosuly doesn't show a good hand - i wonder what he would do with more hcp and a club fit|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3n/topener would have worked out better|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@C is OK, as is 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe 3@C does promise more but he decided to bid it anyway to shut out the hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D seems to be a probe towards a possible 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Bill|pg||
nt|athene: i am getting suggestions that this is a gazzilli sequence but you wouldn't normally play that with a strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: for the 2nd time in this set, there is a possibility of a forcing 3@D bid being passed. |pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be gazzilli or Bocchi could not bid 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: Feldman only down 1 in 2@HX - the best result all over! but -11 IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: n thinking|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D presumably showing "stuff", so bocchi might have visions of 5minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: what is 2@h?|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggesting it is a special "Bocchi Gazzilli"|pg||
nt|athene: but he has to wonder what happened to the heart suit|pg||
nt|mr murray: easy when u see all the cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north reasonably decides that, facing a big red 2-suiter, 3nt is not a good idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: at least we know it is not "Bust"|pg||
nt|vugraphztb:  I cannot hear the explanation given for the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s yelling|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|athene: yeahhh, he passed, go Bocchi! that's what we like to see - when you can see you are getting deeper and deeper into a hole, *stop digging*!|pg||

nt|reisig: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think south would have passed 3nt anyway|pg||
nt|mr murray: might have stolen it at 3n/t|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|twcho: as suggested by our spectator, it shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|peachy: Some people play control responses to 2C, I do not know Nickell-Katz system|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: running that @SJ is a bit weird|pg||
nt|athene: why would you do that?|pg||
nt|athene: just as a matter of interest i don't see why south couldn't rebid 3@C to show a 5-5 maximum hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: isn't that one advantage of playing a strong club?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this when you think they will crawl through the hole in the screen to come and kill you|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: South yelling at me for suggesting North's pass? 3@D is just fine, should make|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|twcho: I will pass with south hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: some people, when playing a weak notrump, give up transfers - they seem quite vehement about it but i never understood why|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: transfers are good!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but he wants to find that heart fit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|twcho: But the opening has enabled them to play in 2@d which not be defeatable|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: ok, another nine-card heart fit missing the queen for Sementa, but this time he doesn't have the agony of a two-way finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: If he had an even crazier sense of humour than he has, Norberto Bocchi could have passed this forcing 2@D bid, without damage. :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzta: I do not type in the bids because of the clicking, until both players have bid and the board is passed through the screen|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: Nickell asks Katz if he had 7 points and Katz agreed|pg||
nt|mr murray: -2|pg||
nt|athene: it's wasteful for the cue to be forcing to explicit suit agreement|pg||
nt|athene: you end up at the 3-level all the time which is just too high|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Actually North played @SK and made 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and I suppose Karic has then ruffed a @s and re-enter dummy with trump K|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|petergill: NS play a Strong Club system|pg||
nt|petergill: If we had a copy of their system, we would give it to you, but we don't|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: s w passing notes|pg||
nt|athene: even after east passes, EW are likely to get pushed too high|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@H here east might feel obliged to give it a fourth|pg||
nt|athene: just in case it makes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: and finesse in trump and then coup Katz in the endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: now n e passing notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still he doesn't have a very good hand - exactly the wrong holding in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: many pairs would wheel out some specialised GF heart raise here but the italians like to use 2@C to get the extra room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: nice stop|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: 4@D must be a splinter with a club fit so Duboin can see 6 or even 7@H on the horizon|pg||
nt|petergill: Here's a more recent and more interesting interview with Norberto Bocchi http://neapolitanclub.altervista.org/eng/and-now-lets-talk-about-bridge-interview-to-norberto-bocchi.html|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: pass clearly forcing|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|hussein2: would this one put Lavazza ahead? Had many comments last time i said so :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztb: N and E talking|pg||
nt|petergill: Any opinions on what South should do over 3@C? Pass? 3@D? 3@H, trying to reach 3NT? Close decision. |pg||
nt|petergill: North might have an opinion on this matter, at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|pelu: he has a normal opening and a passed pd  = 3@D or pass - we can all see that pass would be the winning option - but not so easy for Ferraro|pg||
nt|petergill: For 3@C, North must have a max passed hand, with long clubs, lacking 4 spades (else neg dbl of 2@H)|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, difficult bidding problem|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Given that they open 11 counts and even some 10 counts (but I don't know if that applies to hands with long clubs), Pass of 3@C was possible|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of @CQ|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: nice bid by Karic although it appears that he has only 15 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Yeung goes and gets water to allow Chiu to think|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: or so it seems|pg||
nt|twcho: with all the controls and three good trump support, his hand of course warrants the game call|pg||
nt|peachy: his 15 HCP are all controls and he has a probably useful doubleton, must bid 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: his hand is actually better than most 16 HCP hands|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed!|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: nice intermediates|pg||
nt|peachy: and a fistful of 10/9's that are clearly useful|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the director passes through to see how things are going|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: east hopes to find his partner with a singleton club and two trumps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mr murray: u is right this time :)|pg||

nt|athene: this will tie it surely|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mr murray: win 340|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|twcho: with the balanced nature of the opponents card, there is just no way that this contract can be defeated|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: no kibbitzers are allowed inthe BBO broadcast rooms|pg||
nt|athene: club lead, win @HA, club, ruff, bingo|pg||
nt|athene: that would be the case if south had more clubs and fewer hearts, as you might expect|pg||
nt|athene: life is harsh!|pg||
nt|mr murray: more than tie|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mr murray: leader changes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|twcho: Nickell is leading in their  group comfortably after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: the director might grant an exceptionto the captain of a team, and allow them to kibbitz, if permission is requested|pg||
nt|twcho: Zen is fighting for the KO berth|pg||
nt|twcho: and they need a good score from this match|pg||
nt|athene: the good news is, he wasn't beating it whatever he led|pg||
nt|petergill: At Trick 1, always plan @CQ play before playing from dummy - don't play fast from dummy, then pull out one card then another from your hand - that would destroy the illusion|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphztb: Now Nickell turn to think|pg||
nt|peachy: while it is slow, I'd like to tell you all who are not in Philadelphia, that the tournament is absolutely top-notch professionally organized.  Everything runs like clockwork, is ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clean, neat, and staffed with "zillions" of TDs and caddies and aides on the floor|pg||
nt|petergill: Not much of an illusion at this level, as all 64 (perhaps only 63?) Souths would find @CQ play|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|twcho: is he aware that the Flannery can make with 6 card suits and aware of a probable block|pg||

nt|vugraphztb: have lost the play sorry |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|mc|11|nt|twcho: if he plays @hK |pg||
