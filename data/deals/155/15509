nt|hedyg: 2NT was good/bad|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and you can spy on other tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess same result here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: north has 2 chances to lead his singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|bobholl: possibly 2 down if trump promotion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dec can ruff high|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: on the 3rd @D ie|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that needs to play exactly 2 rounds of heart before|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not trump with 7 :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry running a bit late here |pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 9 tricks are easy, with the @s position can make more|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 3 @s tricks possible|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Hedy,   I think 2N=5+@D and 4+@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: why not 7 of @D (they reverse perhaps)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: ok.. i will check|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 3@C would have been longer @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: well over X they play transfers but over 2@H as well?|pg||
nt|hedyg: also seems like an overbid if not good/bad|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: sry this is normal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: but these ladies are agressive bidders|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: defence right on the ball|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 10@s can be a trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and so is declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: well good would be in context of big club -- but as you say  they are agressive -- especially with distribution|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Operator, Kalita has an Italy flag :)  Please give him Poland|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: no prizes for predicting the final contract here |pg||
nt|jkotor: NS play polish @c, and EW same when vulnerable (i think)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Two Polish pairs here. I have a CC for EW, but not for NS - anyone know any references? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: May not be up-to-date of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: very friendly layout|pg||
nt|jkotor: maybe from European Championship?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: yap, even I would make it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Card ofr EW says strong club if not vulnerable, Polish Club if vulnerable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well east tries a shot in the dark and that means a lot of overtricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: all leads except heart help declarer|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|jkotor: Q@h is a very good card, without it 3nt is troubleome|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonder what that bodes for set |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: EW play precision|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: how many @D from west??|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: looks like easy game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: not as easy as with a 1NT opening :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S will not play well,  and 3 nt is a bit iffy also |pg||
nt|wstuart: that was meant to be a question, "you know him?" but I forgot teh punctuation.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next question -- which is best   1@H or 2N to show 2-lowest|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 11-13 if balanced|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: everything lays perfect for declarer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt open 1 no with 5 solid hearts and 3 small spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 17 with a good 5 carder is too strong for 1 nt in my book. what say u ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: depends on your agreements on what your 2suiter bids show, weak, medium or strong?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit strong that's for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: this sequence is better|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you miss a heart contract to often i thk, i woudnt mind the strenth, since the jack of dia is not a great card|pg||
nt|chick: rebid is the problem ... 1@H, P 1@S, then what?   2!N showing 18+?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes i wd upgrade to 18|pg||
nt|bobholl: would bid 2@C if opening 1@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and sat as many of us would |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is natural..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Vic :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: this could have got ugly for EW |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: whatever you bid, it's a lie ... that's why 1N is better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: also i like to bid my 6card major|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: g'day vic|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria produces many fine players and is now a major challenger in Europe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: indeed, and these 2 are among their finest|pg||
nt|chick: if you had 4 clubs, then I would agree with you|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also factor in @S length -- then randomly pick overcall vs 2-suited bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: partner as passed hand also confuses my decision making|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Wayne |pg||
pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: Chagas has been a champion for ever. I Dont know whether this is a regular partnership|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now comm problems solved|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they make 1 less in this room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: at the other table Piekarek is in 8@S  [4@SX]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which brings up our auction    East DBL probably 4+@S   West DBL probably 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smirnov in West bid 3@S over Hemant Lall's 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: is Auken really thinking here?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: this is a very new partnership created just for this |pg||
nt|hedyg: Michel and Thomas Bessis their teammates at the other table|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|vicky888:  if he starts a club now will take all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: kaplan rubens tell us that hand is worth 18,10 points|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: but if the @C fin loses and @D comes back|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|bobholl: the T9 of @S count also :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: now she needs the K@H in E and when that is 3rd needs the @c finesse as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she has many options --  i thought maybe even @H to 10|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Philadelphia.10/Results.htm  for running scores|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or ruff @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: then she loses the K@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is not a winning option|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh ... that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i meant before @H play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is more revealing line|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: Alain Levy's wife Ann-Frederique is the sister of Mrs Bessis|pg||

mb|3H|nt|henryb:  5@d is also cold as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jkotor: after @h lead?|pg||
nt|jkotor: i think u loose @h+@d+@s = 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  true: I saw @dKx, not Kxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  bad eyesight|pg||
nt|lestergold: via ble is not then same as frigid!|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d should be weak with 6-4, could have passed with better hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  North will be tempted to pass 3N|pg||
nt|jkotor: pass or 5@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west will be tempted to lead the suit his partner doubled for|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Note East passes 3@h - If he doubles 3@H, NS won't bid 3NT  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: North knopws his pard is unlikely to have more than one heart stop|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: oh, sorry - didn't see the double of 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pat attention, boy|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, yes. if S had better @d, 3N might be the last good contract. But I think North should have bid 4@c over 3@d - when partner did not bid 2N over 2HX|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: oohhh big board|pg||
nt|hedyg: Danailov did well not to disc @d|pg||
mb|1D|nt|anton72: could u explain for us this move from S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C, usually no 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: S was dummy, she didnt move|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: 7@H looks good|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2@H=@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall will also open 2@C since they play a form of Precision|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be on their way with a raise of @H's |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will u bid the 6 carder @S suit as 1 @S 2@S or pass ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead 3NT no chance but will he find it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: how ever they do it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: singleton spade is big - if N can get a spade cue from south at some point ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door Townsend and Gold who were Englands leading pair in Bejing are now a dissolved partnership but fulfilling all engagements|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now X i would have passed a reopening ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spade?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bobholl: 5@C has chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes 5@C is the best contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: if she can ruff out the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in heated auction Lalls get to 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c bidding out the shape - so a sing Spade is indicated|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow unlike Chagas|pg||
nt|bobholl: i stop @S and you ?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they will try 3 no and go 4 off|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: possible 3@C is a cue ... we'll see|pg||
nt|sybarra: but question is is the @D bid viewed as cue |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: 3 off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: 2 off i guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: there is the 3@s cue now N is off|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N will ask,  then ask for extra, such as K |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Norths pass meant as more encouraging than immediate 3 hearts. I expect Townsend-Gold to reach game|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levy bid his hand strongly even though he knew that KJ@S not worth much..|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the @D K isn't rigth in a doubleton|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: oh well,  just bid it!|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think Levy can bid more than 2@s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: South hand will be no surprise I think |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|kdr_fm: @s + ruff.  @SJ will be worrying ..|pg||

nt|bobholl: best|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well west need the @Sa for his vul overcall and east needs it for his 2@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: Being non-vulnerable is the cause of many missed games - the 250 bonus is not enough to sway on marginals|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: suction bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they play suction over 2@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S some mixed raise?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i suppose @CQ coming down and endplay in @D|pg||

nt|hedyg: or Qx in @c and K@D on side.......|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|wstuart: Weird 4@D bid by Caputo.|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding in other room much better but lose 1 imp (they found @D and checked on keycards)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: smart switch|pg||

nt|wstuart: Someone suggested that 3NT was a non-serious 3NT, i.e., a mild slam try.  I don't think this is the case for two reasons:|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @DT gives him a @d finesse option|pg||
nt|wstuart: 1) South was willling to play in 3@H.  He can't possibly have even a mild try after that. and |pg||

nt|kdr_fm: brb some message on my screen wont go away covering cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting that the k of @H drops singleton |pg||
nt|wstuart: north made a good decision to bid 5@D rather than DBL|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: so he tries to make only 8 tricks to show how good the bidding was?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is still afraid to go down|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: pretty|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|jkotor: how is 3nt here?|pg||
nt|jkotor: from S hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of work to do on a heart lead|pg||
nt|zbig1959: 3nt?? from S, with passed N hand?? Impossible.. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: (from East; may get spade lead from West). But South will pass I guess|pg||
nt|jkotor: seems down, but makable after @s shot|pg||
nt|jkotor: I am almost sure they play transfers after 1M-2M michaels|pg||
nt|jkotor: S played it with me 10 years ago|pg||
nt|jkotor: but what about this sequence?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is a playbale method, as long as both partners are playing it |pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d - 2@d is different case, cause both suits are known|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, so clubs is the "unbid suit" - so you can decide on your meaning for 2N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either clubs (transfer method) or natural (natural method)|pg||
nt|jkotor: and 2@h/@s: if this is from stopper (thru 3NT), or GF with @c/@d, or maybe invitational with minors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing transfers you can have both 3@c and 3@D as diamond raises (although North is a passed hand here) |pg||
nt|jkotor: no alert here, so this is natural, S is probably thinking why no 3@c opening|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: was it right for Allegaert to cover the @SJ at trick 2?     I think it would surely slow up the play|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: anyway :>|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: another 5@S|pg||
nt|wstuart: Ohhh... have you been surfing those naughty sites whlie commenting?  :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: nice bid by lev - N ignores it|pg||
nt|wstuart: South will try for slam, but we hope they won't get there as the @D loser and @C loser just won't go away.|pg||
nt|bg: here is a rarity 6 h which should a push in any duplicate game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only an accident can stop them -|pg||
nt|bobholl: cuebids enough so guess this is NF|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 hearts here is going down, 3 club is slightly dangerous bid, but makes for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sometimes pd has 109x in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=6+@H MAX  [but limited by failure to open 1@C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 10xx|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bg: 4 clubs shows a good second suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: no idea how they play 4@c, as 5 5 ?|pg||
nt|bg: 4D = cue|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i agree esp since he was a passed hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but i admit that i woudnt have bid 3 clubs, may be over 2 spade, if they bid that|pg||
nt|bobholl: especially with the bad breaks to be expected :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wstuart: Many pairs play transfers after the neg DBL, so 1NT probably showed @Cs.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that i was thinking!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: north hand lends itself to a stayman auction to be followed by invitational 2s bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you go the jacoby route i think must continue with 2nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was time for keycard - that double helped Chagas  -now keycatd|pg||
nt|bg: xx=cue|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: same bid till 3@H in OR and then S bid............4@H!!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: here i am almost sure Levy plays XX as 1st rd control|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: N probably thinking he hand is gettting better and better|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh and there i thought 1NT a mini psyche to discourage the opps :>|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because you are vulnerable|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bg: 4s=cuw|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some undos needed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he might think Chagas has void|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hopes they will play @C for him not a bad idea|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Hemant likes to give his son practice as declarer :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|bg: 5H=2 no Q|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|wstuart: Muriel1 points out that the @CA lead will let 6@S make - however, due to the NS methods here, it is played from teh wrong side for thsi to happen.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: finally - but Levy should have bid this over 4C|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Vic? could they not have a grand?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure - but with aka +club king - all South needed to know was AKQ of hearts and club ace- key card was invented for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Spec making the point that IF 1NT was @C's then 4@C cue is not a good idea|pg||
nt|bg: Joey would have claimed by now|pg||

nt|bobholl: if you play @S iso @C :)|pg||
