nt|bobholl: muiderberg ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: we are back in 3rd session in Match Martens-NIckell|pg||
mb|4N|nt|uni_cicam: There was probably an appeal in the first round so 9 more imps for Martens team|pg||
nt|bobholl: dekkers knows they have a big @S fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|uni_cicam: 3S is a comentator misclick?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Stern|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spades seems like a lot of work for 10 tricks in the OR|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 2@H shows 55 an, 2NT asking|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: yes, thanks|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosmanb: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: 3NT by Kopecky will come|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: it is 5@S for the vulnarable NS|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|toral5: 4@S on a trump guess and NO @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice treatment forcing 3@C by partner for this hand anyway|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: easy 9 tricks so we can relax in the second board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosmanb: There goes the @s guess|pg||
nt|davidstern: I was about to ask how about trumps whenever|pg||
nt|toral5: now no guess:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: the defence is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: 2NT further explained as try for game, single suited...  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: test|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9 are easy only looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1st board was +2 IMPs for Nickell|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sure, but Kopecky will not have any problems with making it|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Good for him to take some time in the first boards|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: last sessions proved most happend in the first 5 boards|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: Kopacky-Kurka are playing ACOL with 5c @S and 12-14 NT, 2 over 1 is 9+|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: 6 @C doubled in other room |pg||
pc|dA|nt|oosmanb: should still make 3@S, 4@S would need @h to be picked up?|pg||
nt|toral5: he can make 10|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @S migth have some difficulties :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|uni_cicam: if @H finesse will be wrong, will be difficult to guess @D, but @H K is on side, no problems for Kopecky|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: For BBO JEC matches fans, Teodorescu is LeRouMain|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: cross ruff works well in 5@S, doesnt it?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: South is the one with most @C (almost ) now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sT|nt|uni_cicam: every player will duck @H K, is there any other line of play?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: can still loose 3 tricks|pg||

nt|bobholl: this is almost as good as @C to 9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|toral5: yes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course he had best hand at the table|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 4@H is down after @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note: Zia's DBL was cards -- NOT penalty|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: depends if Kopecky will Open 1NT here. He will with me, but he has more options here in ACOL and suppose he will treat it like 15-17 and open 1@H|pg||

nt|yvesj49: part score in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H, 2N or 3@D?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: since 1@H=4+  Kurka using some form of checkback -- but with 4333 many wouldn't bother|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  3@D was typo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ralph Katz will rebid @S so they should reach 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: nope -- i didn't think about 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe max 1@S bid with BOTH decent @S AND @D support??|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  10 4@S in the other room, so Hamman-Zia need to find the ruff|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
mb|d|nt|uni_cicam: that might encourage NS for other boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||

nt|yvesj49: good view @h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: the range for 1N response is higher than standard because if 1@D opened with balanced hand it is 11-13 HCP|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|xenya: well done by S this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: what happens if declarer returns a club at trick 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: then not omnly are communications destroyed but the club suit will be set up if a third one is played|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im told that Zua for example did just that and made|pg||
nt|lestergold: It seems that a number of declarers played A@s and then a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key issue seems to be retaining the entries in dummy like that A@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: on second and third thoughts if you limit your heart losers to 1 and ur club losers to 1 you can afford to lose a trump and make so toucing hearts at all is very risky|pg||
nt|lestergold: a FASCINIATING HAND|pg||
nt|xenya: was that the last board?|pg||
nt|xenya: suppose you play a club at trick 2 -- S wins and returns a trump |pg||

nt|spooky: Hello all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: trump lead beats|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|oosmanb: Hoi!|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C was 6@C or 5@C-4M 2@D relay 2@S natural, 3@H forcing I guess|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So West has shown @C + @S, limited hand|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@C is 11-15 about|pg||
nt|oosmanb: East deciding between @C and NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: since West could have dubious 2 or 3 @D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosmanb: even though he promised a stopper|pg||
nt|yvesj49: possible to play on @c !!!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|spooky: the 4 players at this table know each other very well. all from the Netherlands and training a lot together|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Good choice I think, with the mini @S fit as well.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: yes I found that interesting.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: Interesting 1NT opening by West next door, that got them to 4@H making!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: though it may not lead to many explainations of alerts if they all know the system...  |pg||
nt|spooky: I don't think they know each others system that well..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I will do my best :)|pg||
nt|spooky: they are "rivals" in the dutch league :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Running scores are 108-97|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Not 119-86 as we see here|pg||
nt|oosmanb: April can you fix ?|pg||
nt|spooky: She can't fix scores, she can only check at the players|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Alrighties we'll keep the kibitzers informed then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I can fix scores for this session, but I do not have access to the previous results|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best line here G?|pg||
nt|spooky: I would throw a @S and play @HQand see what the opponents do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: playing @h does establish communication for the 2@S ruffs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: begin with @S is bad :(|pg||
nt|yvesj49: she did'nt put the 10 ??????|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|spooky: he ruffed directly, so looks like heis playing to make his hand good|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Still needs to ruff one @S which shouldnt be hard to manage now that he has communication|pg||
nt|spooky: he'll throw 1@S on @HK and ruff 1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes but isnt that risky|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @h 4-2 prmotes A10x etc?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: everyone is just staring at the cards on the table...  |pg||
nt|spooky: yes, I see, but I think there was no way to declare without that risk|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: screen goes down, south asking Qs I cant hear...  |pg||
nt|spooky: probably about the bidding, and how many @H's west may have etc|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's probably asking if 3NT showed 5422 or can be 5431? |pg||
nt|spooky: probably not 5422 I think, because East might have bid something like to end up in 4@H somehow then|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and other shapes|pg||
nt|jeanhari: or 544|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|davidstern: Sorry but I have been receiving so many requests for pairs results|pg||
nt|spooky: a lot of ways to 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: no problem David. We like to hear results!!!  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably quite nervous|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|yvesj49: will be better the other segments|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|davidstern: No way to avoid 11 I would say|pg||
nt|davidstern: But of course declarer doesnt know that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oosmanb: Now he will|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is getting harder and harder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: J@H discard will scare him alot|pg||
nt|davidstern: North Pitches a heart the @C10 may come into play|pg||
nt|spooky: even if North discards @HJ he still has no choice does he?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should be OK @HK pitch last spade and club honour|pg||
nt|oosmanb: well he can try ruffing @H high|pg||
nt|davidstern: But this would be down if North held @CA10x|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and then playing another @S|pg||
nt|spooky: did you see another line David?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could just play to establish hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Leave all dummy's trumps intact|pg||
nt|davidstern: Lots of entries|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That would work too|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway did well to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: but your trumps in your hand are quite bad...|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: I think I can see the wheels turning in their heads..  we could be in for a long night at this rate. :)|pg||
nt|spooky: so a possible overruff with @C10 is still there|pg||
nt|davidstern: OK I am off leave you in very capable hands. Most of the matches are close to conclusive but one or two still in the balance|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I think he means your hands Spooky|pg||
