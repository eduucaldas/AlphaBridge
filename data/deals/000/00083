nt|chrumchrum: Welcome all, here we are at the second day of this monster event|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: this looks like an exciting match in group B|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: USA 2nd - Turkey 9th|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to our commentators: Kamil Gazdecki, Poland, Udo Kasimir, Germany, Cheri Bjerkan, USA, and Bart Bramley, USA|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: its too early to tell yet, but both teams are in strong contention to advance to knock-out stage|pg||
nt|udo: good morning :)|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: Since we have 2 USA commentators today, I'll be a honorary Turkish for this session|pg||
nt|cherilou: have I been ungagged?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, cheri :) welcome|pg||
nt|bbramley: hi cheri|pg||
nt|udo: hi cheri and bart:)|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: welcome|pg||
nt|cherilou: Yes indeed@Hooray! Do we know which players are in this room?|pg||
nt|cherilou: Bart, great to work with you|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: this is a duel between 5 card majors (USA) and..... 5 card majors (Turkey)|pg||
nt|cherilou: And hello to others-Udo and Kamil|pg||
nt|bbramley: both pairs play "standard", 5-card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|udo: i printed now CC of levin-weinstein , will try to give some system informations during the bidding|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: Hi there|pg||
nt|udo: hi:)|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: Americans are using Flannery, not the most popular opener in the tournament scene|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: Turkish - 2@D is both majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|dburn: One would have expected 2@s, but perhaps that would be intermediate|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough hand for E/W - they have 27 HCP but no game is good, although this time they can make 5@D|pg||
nt|udo: 5@D makes 11 tricks here , with the @C well placed for USA|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: lucky 5@C on this one|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|chrumchrum: or 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dburn: Still, this bidding will help them find they don't have a spade stopper|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: strangely enough, with no intervention they wouldve probably ended up in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: yes, left to themselves many pairs would reach 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe that, with @sQ wasted, they don't have the values for game - though to diagnose all this would be a fine effort|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: In a sense, @hQ is also wasted - it doesn't make much difference in 5@c whether you have it or not|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bbramley: 4@H possible contract also, needs 4-3 @Hs and only 1 club finesse|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|udo: so, a sensible stop, but can be expensive, nevertheless|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: sensible decision, aslo many would cringe at not bidding a game with so many hcp|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|chrumchrum: first blood drawn|pg||
nt|udo: fine start for turkey|pg||
nt|bbramley: flannery!|pg||
nt|cherilou: Which pair is at the other table?|pg||
nt|dburn: and no one had anywhere to go after that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: Welland and Fallenius|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: many would open Levin's hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|udo: he overcalles a straight 3 @S !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: overcalled|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: 2@D is 5+@S 4+@H 11-15|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: If he did that, he deserved to go for 500 :)|pg||
nt|udo: agree:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherilou: Uh oh they wrong sided it|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: wrong sided, but a duck will let him make now|pg||
nt|dburn: But, as we saw from Levin and Weinstein's result, sometimes your bidding does not get you the results you deserve|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bbramley: tough to right-side this in any system|pg||
nt|cherilou: I'm sure he'll duck---yep|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bbramley: still needs to guess one black card, I believe|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will help|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: He may just cross-ruff, but needs to be a little careful|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, crossruff will work|pg||
nt|dburn: Easier to start with clubs - hearts may get over-ruffed by South at an awkward stage|pg||
nt|udo: crossruff=best line, needs no guess in @S and @C|pg||
nt|udo: only some 4-3 standings|pg||
nt|bbramley: don't think it matters. if wrong opponent has last heart or club, ruff high and try the other suit|pg||
nt|dburn: True - it's only the 5-2 breaks that might do you in|pg||
nt|bbramley: at worst need @SQ with north|pg||
nt|cherilou: With the 2 suits to be crossruffed being = length,it's probably just a guess as which one to start first|pg||
nt|bbramley: @S8 is high enough at the end|pg||
nt|dburn: Clubs probably better - the fall of a doubleton king could enable you to change tack|pg||
nt|dburn: whereas the fall of a doubleton heart honor is less use|pg||
nt|udo: good point|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree|pg||
nt|cherilou: me too|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: me three|pg||
nt|dburn: Oh, well. That's my sensible comment for the day, and I wasted it early :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: if south inserts @S9 on 4th round, overruff and crossruff high|pg||

nt|chrumchrum: why are you underruffing opps? ;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The link to the convention cards is  www.bridgebase.com/istanbul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chrumchrum: 5@D here|pg||
nt|cherilou: Uh oh who do we have amongst us?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|udo: but difficult to reach after the weak-two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To access the up to minute results and rankings: Click Explore Bridge! ---> Vugraph Theatre and the big green banner above the chat window: "Click for latest standings and scores ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: of the Olympiad"|pg||
nt|bbramley: identical play in 4@S at the other table, except south did ruff with @S9 at end|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: once they bid @S a couple of times - 5@D becomes more likely|pg||
nt|udo: what should levin do now ?|pg||
nt|dburn: Can Levin bid diamonds naturally? Some play that as showing a heart fit. maybe only lead-directing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cherilou: Their cc says new suits forcing-- but maybe not after 2@S|pg||
nt|udo: without iontervention new suit is forcing on their cc|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bbramley: 5@D is no bargain, needs lots of good luck|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Still, 3@h also shows a heart fit in some circles|pg||
nt|udo: 3@S doubled is no fun for NS|pg||
nt|dburn: Levin isn't thinking of saving or bidding a game to make. He's just trying to push them around.|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: isnt a singleton @H a fit? 'P, we've got more of them then they do' ;-)|pg||
nt|bbramley: 2@S is a little light for my taste|pg||
nt|cherilou: I think all will go quietly|pg||
nt|bbramley: at matchpoints would double for sure|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room they doubled 2 @S !!|pg||
nt|dburn: These days, you don't necessarily have more hearts than they do just because partner is supposed to have six.|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: he might as well have 4?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|dburn: But Weinstein is a Solid Citizen, so will probably have what he says he has :)|pg||
nt|udo: guess levin will be endplayed in the end of this contract|pg||
nt|cherilou: Wow- doubling a partscore to get +100---a little scary|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|udo: 2 @S, 2 @h , club ducked , and he is forced to play @C,@D or @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: e/w can't avoid endplaying themselves|pg||
nt|udo: no|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: likely to be a flat board|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bbramley: best now is to win and return low @H for east to ruff. then @S exit makes declarer guess how to play @Cs for the endplay|pg||
nt|udo: undo ?|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: I think thats what he wishes now to do|pg||

nt|mareczek: slightly worse in %% than 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: and make it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|curtis: Versace-Lauria system should be understandable to the audience.  Their only serious artificiality is with strong constructive auctions.  Otherwise very 'standard' approach|pg||

mb|1S|nt|dburn: This is a very good slam, and Turkey have bid it|pg||
nt|udo: good result here in the closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrumchrum: nice hand, and the result is likely to be duplicated|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bbramley: expect a push, good hand for a splinter in @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrumchrum: 3nt shows any 1444|pg||
nt|cherilou: Good slam here- they do have the methods for it--yes, this is a splinter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|udo: but splinter with an ace is not everybodys choice|pg||
nt|dburn: Some may not like to splinter on the singleton @dA, but I don't think Levin has much choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cherilou: It is the most descriptive bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|cherilou: and look how great that makes the west hand|pg||
nt|dburn: The reason for this is that partner, with such as KQxx facing shortage, thinks these are wasted cards|pg||
nt|bbramley: i suspect 3nt was mini-spl, 4@C ask, 4@H shows short @D|pg||
nt|dburn: but with four little ones, he doesn't care what his partner's singleton is|pg||
nt|udo: thinking about 7 ?|pg||
nt|udo: against 2 aces |pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't mind spl with ace, partner will still usually go right|pg||
nt|bbramley: bigger disadvantage is that partner will expect more values in the long suits|pg||
nt|dburn: He may be thinking of seven, but even facing a great heart holding such as @hQJxx, there would be plenty of work to do|pg||
nt|udo: or is kolata thinking ?|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: for example Q@H|pg||
nt|dburn: The operators can't type the bids in until both players on the same side of the screen have called|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, South and West are on the same side of the screen, so our operator will not enter the bids until both players have made their call|pg||
nt|cherilou: Why is Steve having a problem? If he asks for K's with 5NT because he has all the key cards and the trump Q he'll find out there are no K's in the east hand. |pg||
nt|dburn: I am sure Kolata has passed and Weinstein is thinking|pg||
nt|bbramley: maybe 6@H here would ask for 3rd round control|pg||
nt|dburn: Maybe West is wondering how to find out if East has Jxxx QJxxx A Axx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: still, he has a lot of @Ds to ruff, 7 might get sticky on a trump lead anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - you really would need East to have a source of tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: looks like he's using plenty of mental energy chasing an elusive 7|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose he might be wondering whether 6@h would send the right message|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: if he gets it wrong, the effect will be disastrous|pg||
nt|bbramley: it would in my own partnership|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever try he makes, Levin will reject in any case|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|cherilou: but even the @HQ doesn't get you to 13 tricks. You would need to take 3@D ruffs to make it.That could create major transportation problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: Sure - you'd need the jack of hearts as well, or plenty of luck|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: uff, lots of stress for a push|pg||
nt|udo: 6 @h = try for grand |pg||
nt|dburn: As Cheri says, @hQ by itself isn't enough. Just because you don't have any losers, that doesn't mean you have 13 winners|pg||
nt|bbramley: i spoke too quickly. transpo ok even with trump lead opposite, say, Jxxx-Qxxx-A-Axxx. need merely 2 rounds of @H's to go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bbramley: of course, @SJ is nice to have|pg||
nt|cherilou: I think 6@H was a good bid, Bobby might have had QJxxx of @H's and VOILA|pg||
nt|bbramley: this was a very good auction, reached right spot for right reason|pg||
nt|dburn: I think this was a very good auction indeed. Comes of being very good players, I guess :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|s7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dburn: They should introduce marks for style and technical merit.|pg||
nt|dburn: Or maybe not. We have enough controversial judgements as it is.|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: then it would be like ice skating|pg||
nt|bbramley: he still needs 2 rounds of @Hs to go through. he will be careful to lead 2nd @H from dummy as well|pg||
nt|chrumchrum: 5.7 for style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morocco missed the slam against Italy after East made an 11-14 hcp raise (3@D). A few cue bids and sign off in 4@S|pg||

nt|dburn: He did well, though, but it is still not clear for NS to reach game. Kolata could bid 3NT now anyway, since he can't really have a heart stop - but will he? Or will he bid 5@d?|pg||
