nt|lebasi: Bocci-Duboin plays a green system with a lot of relais|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|adolfod: perhaps he excpected a four card support|pg||
nt|mlodybog: I wonder whether it's makeable at all|pg||
nt|mareczek: deep finesse shows that possible|pg||
nt|swanson: The dbl of the cue bid helopd the auction along - it's probably going to come home on the cross ruff|pg||
nt|mareczek: in my opinion without touching trumps too much|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer has 3 main options ...|pg||
nt|lc: 1) Ruff heart in dummy|pg||

pc|d8|nt|swanson: I would guess Belgium will open 1NT with the North hand in the other room and arrive in 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mlodybog: Goes after the 1st possibility|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, that will enable him to fall back on the third|pg||
nt|mlodybog: Which is still winning one|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is still possible to play for the cross ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: since, as it happens, the hand that discards a diamond on the hearts started with four of them|pg||
nt|swanson: surely that it best with know spade length in North|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a tough hand to start the match with|pg||
nt|lc: I agree -- declarer has so many possible ways to choose from.|pg||
nt|mareczek: when the heart split 4-2 will show, cross ruff is the only option|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bg: they did|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: But is it clear to play a heart now?  Maybe draw 1 trump first?  Maybe cash diamonds first?  Lots of possible choices!|pg||

nt|roghog: Reid Newell play strong 1@c|pg||
nt|caputo: 10 for belgium good start for us |pg||
nt|Walddk2: a 2-way club that was introduced by Anders Morath of Sweden when he got fed up with intervention after their strong 1@C in the Carotti system|pg||

nt|lebasi: dble is neg always|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe John Swanson played against Morath a few times back in the late 70's|pg||
nt|vugraph197: in second board fantoni played 3nt with 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you not John?|pg||
nt|bg: Philippe Caputo is one of the Belgium players sitting out this match He is here to lend mental support|pg||
mb|3H|nt|swanson: in 1977|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: I'd be surprised if they didn't get a chance. A Polish 1@c must be one of the more frequent openings.|pg||
nt|caputo: 4 loosers hand ... have to bid i think|pg||
nt|swanson: it's going to be tough for NS to reach game, North will have to do it on his own|pg||
nt|timb: ah! |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is merely competitive. Most top players use 3@D as forcing with hearts, 3@C as forcing with spades  ... and some have reversed the meaning of the two|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tsanders: fellow commentartors for this set are Richie Reisig,  Migry Zur Campanile. Please welcome them|pg||
nt|vugraph197: hi all , names and scores for 2 first boards in a minute|pg||
mb|p|nt|caputo: yesssssss|pg||
pc|h2|nt|swanson: The Finnish Bart Simpson Club looks a bit like Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The player in the East seat is   Bäckström   or  Backstrom  if you can't type  ä  and ö|pg||
nt|mareczek: this looks like a gift of the 9-th trick|pg||
nt|dburn: and a bit like imprecision :)|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer would like to set up @D but retain an entry to dummy to run them. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: Good Morning everyone|pg||
nt|nickf: well done to the Morroccons getting to the only making game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|roghog: 4@s makes if @s break. lucky to stay low here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can take advantage of the unusual 2NT overcall since you now have 3@C and 3@D available as constructive|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|timb: What it strongest over 3@H - X, 3NT or 4@D?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Welcome Migry|pg||
nt|tsanders: we begin with board 3 so there will be comparisons in the open room|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lc: With a @C trick in, this will now be easy -- just duck another @D|pg||
nt|mareczek: best defence was to jump with @cA and insist on @s|pg||
nt|lc: From declarer's point of view, a @D now would be annoying...but...|pg||
nt|mlodybog: I think hopping up with a @c would make it impossible|pg||
nt|lc: The defense can't knock out the @DA -- so declarer can unblock his @Sa in time.|pg||
nt|adolfod: Q h!?|pg||
nt|swanson: i would start the north hand with 2@D over 1@H - tough to describe the strength after 2NT|pg||
nt|bg: 5dx in other room only depends on guessing club queen|pg||
nt|timb: probably easier to judge if you do|pg||
nt|swanson: double is an offer to defend - not wise with 6-5|pg||

nt|roghog: big test for Reid Newell against two of the best in the world here|pg||
nt|timb: true|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|migry: i'd really like to know the names of the players - after i printed thousands of convention cards:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: Suomis in closed room reached a very good game on 11-11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|granguru: hi carol, steve and peter|pg||
nt|timb: and 3@C or 3@D|pg||
nt|swanson: Johnson couldn't raise because partner could have only two|pg||
nt|bg: I think minimum is thre dia|pg||
nt|swanson: Belgium did make 5@D in the other room on the previous deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Suomi is Finnish for Finland|pg||
nt|lc: This game is reasonable because of the good club spots.  Take away the @C10,9,8 -- and not so good.|pg||
nt|nickf: let's hope Morrocco recover and bod a slam here|pg||
nt|pkl: Hachimi and Berrada are not list with a convention-card. Does anyone know what they play?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 3@C = invitational raise, no singleton|pg||
nt|pkl: 6@S looks touch and go.|pg||
nt|csimon: looks like they shuffled 2 partnerships|pg||
pc|d6|nt|coutred: Looks as if they play French standard|pg||
nt|roghog: highly artificial. 1@H = @s|pg||
nt|reisig: anyone else confused by the bidding?|pg||
nt|rossg: all i see in the notes is that @H-@S=art game force|pg||
nt|rossg: that is 1@H-1@S of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't say what 3@C is on the Italian convention card|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|roghog: Reid is asking|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lc: What makes this fit so magical is not just the club spots, but the no wastage in @D.|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h is a limit raise with only three trumps. North has a minimum with no real way to know whether it is a suitable minimum or not.|pg||
nt|tsanders: very good for the EW to get to game|pg||
nt|reisig: gm Tommy:)|pg||
nt|rossg: they are in a relay auction but cant tell you what relay responses are|pg||
pc|hK|nt|coutred: 3@D is 11-14 4-card fit|pg||
nt|tsanders: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|tsanders: Have been expecting you Richie, chain rubbing you?|pg||
nt|reisig: :)))|pg||
nt|migry: there r some losing options|pg||
nt|reisig: might go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, Fantoni got it right. They know what they are doing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|reisig: hi Migry:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pkl: Yes... but it looks like some kind of Bergen here - 3@D is invitational with spades|pg||
nt|nickf: already 11-10 after 3 bds|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|nickf: well he's better than invitational|pg||
nt|pkl: ... this is followed by a cue-bid sequence with the pass showing 2. round controle.|pg||
nt|reisig: They found 4@h with 5-0 and wrong sided|pg||
nt|swanson: 3@S as a preemptive raise seems better than 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: It's a little too good for an invitational raise in my opinion|pg||
nt|migry: Hi Richie @h@h@h|pg||
nt|tsanders: certainly are Migry. Take back my prediction|pg||
nt|roghog: Duboin thinks babbo natale has come early!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|reisig: He can't make if N plays trumps|pg||
nt|tsanders: east played south for 6@s, therefore didn't try to pitch a @c from dummy|pg||
nt|migry: makes sense as he knows that south is extremely weak so must be bidding on shape|pg||
nt|vugraph197: for all matches we are getting our files after the matches already started , and i am the one who recieves those so it is hard to follow for me in the begining :)|pg||
nt|reisig: He needs to be very careful here|pg||
nt|migry: while Bocchi thinks, i can tell you that the north south pair are playing a simple 2/1 GF with variable no trumps|pg||
nt|migry: 10-12 non vul 1st and 2nd seat and 15-17 all other |pg||
nt|tsanders: north may come to 2@h tricks on uppercut of @cs|pg||
nt|migry: the 6 @h is a very important card|pg||
nt|migry: south may just score a trump trick:)|pg||
nt|reisig: It seems like he must win this in hand|pg||
nt|lebasi: they found their fit but didn't find opps cards in the dark:-(|pg||
pc|h8|nt|granguru: final looks conservative, to say the least|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mlodybog: But repeated @d leads put a big question mark as to making a game|pg||
nt|timb: 3@C gives an almost free takeout double|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|rossg: perhaps Bocchi was unable to attain enough info to make sure there wasnt a better spot but his failure to dble here could be costly|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|timb: of spades|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|swanson: this nice fitting hand will produce ten tricks even the the 4-1 heart split - declarer can discard on the second diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|pkl: Nick: You are right.... it is better than invitational unless they have light openings|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|lc: What do you guys think of the 2@S balance here?|pg||

nt|bg: I would pass 1nt with west hand it is on lead|pg||
nt|timb: no - overcalling on balanced hands over a weak 1NT seems to lose more than it gains|pg||

nt|roghog: yes, Italians will play @h every time|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|mlodybog: I don't like it :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Finns use "don't" against a strong notrump, Hamilton versus weat|pg||
nt|tsanders: south has to exercise damage control on this one. Off for sure, but how many?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mlodybog: Any lead vs NT suits me so why bother|pg||
nt|mareczek: to much strength, too weak spades|pg||
nt|lc: I like balancing but not here.  5-3-3-2 not my style (also, they are vul -- try for +200 or +300)|pg||
nt|lc: I would need more shape to balance.|pg||
nt|migry: west is going to be endplayed after this trick|pg||
nt|timb: seems normal enough to lead a diamond though|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pkl: Now it's 3NT. 11 or 12 tricks with a club lead|pg||
nt|migry: if he plays a spade declarer is very well positioned|pg||

nt|mlodybog: Even all those side Qs and Js packed in spades would make a difference|pg||
pc|h3|nt|reisig: looks like down 200|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: Well, the ace of diamonds from AKxx might not fill us with the joys of spring|pg||
nt|nickf: i guess he'll take his 11|pg||

nt|dburn: Believe me, if I can find a disappointing opening lead, I will find one.|pg||

nt|swanson: Down 2 for a wash|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|tsanders: At the end of the day after 3 matches, Hong Kong was in 7th place in their group (qualifying 4). Italy in 2nd|pg||
mb|2H|nt|reisig: 1NT generally shows more high cards than this|pg||
nt|migry: if it is natural - but i have a feeling it's not|pg||
nt|migry: lots of pairs play that a 1Nt TO A DOUBLE OF 1s SHOWS A NEGATIVE HAND|pg||

mb|4H|nt|eggy: how would you get anywhere close?|pg||

nt|vugraph197: thank you Roland :)|pg||
nt|caputo: flat board if using blaackwood|pg||
nt|Walddk2: High card points. Johnson has 10 in the black suits. 8 (2 aces) would have been better!|pg||
nt|vugraph197: here we got little different situation as we can recieve cards only after the play started so i am not able to be here for the first 2 boards as i must go 2 stairs down to get the ...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pkl: A bit less than 75%. |pg||
nt|pkl: Nick ;-))|pg||
nt|csimon: this is an intermediate bid 10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodybog: Quite conservative contract in closed|pg||
nt|bbramley: 2nt must be transfer here too|pg||
nt|migry: 2NT = 4@h limit + :)|pg||
nt|lebasi: of course, they win 6@d so specs take it out|pg||
nt|swanson: This is now a dangerous situation because Stas does not have the high card values he promised for 1@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lc: And I thought I opened light!!!    1@D  by West ???|pg||
nt|mareczek: opening by West is a little modern|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebasi: it's very difficult...|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@c "strong", at least 14|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But his hand surely qualifies for a strong club|pg||
nt|timb: Stas needs to do the asking|pg||
nt|caputo: @c strong and superfit stop now at 5 |pg||
mb|4C|nt|nickf: an ominour lead for Nunes|pg||
nt|pkl: Nunes knows he is one down now|pg||
nt|eggy: He could claim 1 or 2 down now|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 1D is frisky even for a forcing club system.  Definitely a Bart Simpson bid|pg||
nt|lc: Their card says 9-14 -- so I guess they are in range.|pg||
nt|mareczek: E probably knows his partner's style|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@d may be systemic - I think at least one of the pairs plays very light openings|pg||
nt|migry: Fabio le Presti is helping us with the italian system:))|pg||
nt|bbramley: then what's 3@C?|pg||
nt|migry: Lo Presti - sorry:)|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't have any experience with a strong club, so I don't know what liberties can be taken.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|reisig: 2N may be 2 way ...weak with @c or 4+@h|pg||
nt|migry: 3@c is minimum with 4@h|pg||
nt|reisig: ahhh|pg||
nt|migry: and i always have to believe the Italian explanation - i am married to one:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If ever there is a hand suited for Blackwood this must be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|caputo: 4nt 5@d 5@h and stop|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|swanson: Bockstrom certainly allowed for the opening.|pg||

nt|migry: 2 diamonds a spade and a club|pg||

nt|roghog: 1@d = @h (of course!!!)|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: hmmm  5@H??|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: oops |pg||

nt|bg: not sure what 5 h means result is same at both tables anyway|pg||
nt|swanson: What are the responses?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Stas showed keycards rather than asking for them; we are not quite sure what happened here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you Philippe?|pg||
nt|caputo: 4@s is kickback i think ????|pg||
nt|lebasi: /|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In that case 4NT can't show 2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|caputo: perhaps sorry don t know|pg||

nt|swanson: At least they knew what they were doing.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|tsanders: think he'll go for the deep finesse in @hs?|pg||
nt|migry: all the red cards look the same to me - i'm colorblind|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lc: Still, a VUL game you definitely should be in   (not this time, though!)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lc: When VUL, at IMPs, if Game is even 40%, it is with the IMP odds to bid it.|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed, 1 is defined on the card as 9-14, may be a doubleton, so West not only has extra values, he has extra diamonds.|pg||
nt|mareczek: in this board 4@h would be right with the odds|pg||
nt|swanson: I like the club lead.  Looks to North like the only (wild) shot to set 5@H is to find partner with a singleton club and the trumps ace.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|roghog: my unsophisticated bidding would get to 3NT|pg||

nt|bg: Johnson just reached for a glass of water?|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a possible heart slam, failing with the @DK offside.|pg||
nt|caputo: 50% @h 6 not so bad one...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: It's less than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts must behave too|pg||
nt|timb: about 40%|pg||
nt|caputo: yes|pg||
nt|swanson: Because you need the hearts to come in with one loser it is not percentage.|pg||
nt|bg: 1c= 15+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: N/S got lucky. I don't like sitting on either side.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pkl: Would you follow the law and bid 4@S here?|pg||
nt|nickf: not red vs white|pg||
nt|nickf: the law doesnmt apply at those colours|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lc: Half the deals had nothing to the play.  West should have spent more time on 6@C  ):|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe BBO could give first names - helpful when husband and wife are on the same team|pg||
nt|ritong: mostly when 5332|pg||
nt|reisig: nice 3N|pg||
nt|tsanders: here is a great site for getting lots of information about this tournament, even results when they are all out (not yet)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pkl: No - i agree. The hand is to flat and defensive. A club less and one more diamond....|pg||
nt|csimon: responsive dbl|pg||
nt|bbramley: north, with his good clubs, could expect south to cover enough of his other losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: cant see them bidding 4H now|pg||
nt|granguru: x should offer support plus @HS|pg||

nt|nickf: 4H seems like a good contract|pg||
nt|granguru: -1|pg||
nt|pkl: 4@C must be one down on any reasonable defense.|pg||
nt|csimon: the Italians are quite conservative bidders - Fantoni is likely to pass|pg||
nt|nickf: how so?|pg||
nt|nickf: but 4H is OK.|pg||
nt|bg: 1nt + 10+ bal|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: It may not help their marriage. This way, the wife gets to blame the husband for everything Backstrom has done wrong :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eggy: can the morrocans find their ruff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I don't think the 1C bid is supposed to have a singleton when in the minimum range|pg||
nt|mlodybog: 1@d shows minimum 4 cards|pg||
nt|mareczek: in Polish club 1@c opens also with 4441 with 1@d 12-15 PC|pg||
nt|lc: These deals are duplicated throughout the 72-team field.  So, if they seem "quiet/dull," they will be that way in every ...|pg||
nt|lc: other match.|pg||
nt|dburn: I think he has to treat this as balanced - all openings other than 1@c show 4+ cards|pg||
nt|nickf: or the @d switch|pg||
nt|tsanders: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Istanbul.04/Istanbul.htm |pg||

nt|tsanders: and will make 7 it appears|pg||

nt|vugraph197: bocchi played fast hearts whith finesse and then diamonds|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@s showed balanced with 4@s 12-14|pg||
nt|caputo: 2 bids for belgium....1NT 3NT ....|pg||
nt|swanson: The jack third holdings in each hand are not appealing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the other table Conraets-Engel, the most experienced pair, are NS for Belgium against Lauria-Versace|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bg: interesting pattern developing after six rounds all countries who have won previous Olympiads are at or near the top of their groups Italy,France, Poland, Brazil, USA|pg||

nt|mareczek: double is "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|bbramley: not me. i always pass with balanced.|pg||
nt|migry: but it's a matter of agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: S can have spades for the opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|mareczek: this hand is good for re open double|pg||
nt|mlodybog: @h + another 5-5|pg||
nt|lc: Since North didn't bid 3NT, he seems to be playing for penalties (hoping South will X).|pg||
nt|swanson: does south now bid 3D?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@h=6-10 PC, 5+-5+ with hearts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|swanson: This is a big system failure for the Poles|pg||

pc|cA|nt|csimon: 3@h is easy and the law says to bid it|pg||
nt|granguru: Law works perfectly here|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW can make 5@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mlodybog: Any reasonable S hand gives 8 tricks in NT right off the mark|pg||

pc|hA|nt|migry: 2h= 4@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: 1 problem less|pg||

nt|swanson: Poor decision by Johnson not to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think the bidding went like this|pg||
nt|bg: with 8 bagger non vul have to bid |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lc: I know 2@H was "6-10" (@H+?) -- but presumably at these colors he wouldn't be too light, so I'm surprised North didn't ...|pg||
nt|lc: try for (or just bid) game.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: not me. i play dbl is pen, pass is f over 2@C or 2@D (but not 2@H)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mareczek: not less interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We skipped board 13 and 14 while we were down, but Marcin will no doubt enter the scores shortly|pg||
nt|timb: boring board - 11 tricks in 3nT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So will Marek in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodybog: save of a slam possible|pg||
nt|lc: At these colors, N-S can make life difficult for E-W to find their slam.|pg||
nt|swanson: We'll see if Bart can get the Finns to the great 6D contract|pg||
nt|bbramley: on bd 12 fantoni-nunes got all of their tricks vs 2@S dbl for 7 more imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So we should get results on those 2 boards before long|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: transfer|pg||
nt|vugraph197: scores are updated now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: Not so easy to save when your side has two aces and a king|pg||
nt|mlodybog: or not so great 6@s|pg||
nt|mareczek: or 6@s after 6@h save|pg||
nt|lc: Kowalski isn't done yet, I suspect.  I would have gone past 4@H right away.  No?|pg||
nt|mlodybog: A bit timid by Kowalski, 5@h would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lc: How about 5@H the first time?|pg||
nt|pkl: The round robin is four groups of 18 teams, ending in 4*4 winners.|pg||
nt|csimon: 4@s is difficult to find after the 1nt opening|pg||
nt|migry: nice grand in @d here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: He might have bid 5@h - but when the opponents do that, it's because they're afraid you can make a lot|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S by N now?|pg||
nt|granguru: 5 boards to  go , but 2 not counted, 14 and 15 are potentially imps for Morocco|pg||
nt|coutred: Interesting choice of opening.  Alternative was 2@S, unbalanced 5+@S 10-13|pg||
nt|pkl: I would hate opening 2@S with that suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Marcin|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mareczek: E may not bid 6@d|pg||
nt|dburn: and West might have bid 6@d in that auction|pg||
nt|mareczek: no club control|pg||
nt|swanson: But that wouldn't shut Salomaa out.  Tuff for either North or South to save with their aces.|pg||
nt|lc: Who can argue with success.   Anyway, now he might push them into it  -:|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, he settled for five, and East could not really do any more|pg||
nt|mareczek: now 5@h will enable forcing pass|pg||
nt|mareczek: 6@h is cheaper than 5@d|pg||
nt|pkl: Nunes will probably bid 4@S now - believing he will end in a moysian fit|pg||
nt|vugraph197: sry for this but dhcp server went down and we needed to get some static ip adresses to work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 and 14 both flat|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|migry: or Nt |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|swanson: but will he know to bid 6@H|pg||
nt|csimon: I wonder what 2nt meant - couldn't be a natural invitation - some sort of Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|ritong: nice recover|pg||
nt|pkl: 2NT probably Lebensohl´.|pg||
nt|tsanders: Missdefense vs 2@sx cost Hong Kong 7 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mlodybog: 5@h is cheaper than 6@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mareczek: but when EW bid, for example 6@s after push, NS may not save with @cAK|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a good 6NT contract on N-S cards, failing in this deal.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru: I think Nunes knows p has5@S|pg||
nt|csimon: if Lebensohl, then 3@s was a BIG bid by Fantoni!|pg||
nt|bbramley: awkward 4th suit auction, gobbled up room|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|migry: is it 4NT for D or for S now?|pg||
nt|migry: Spades|pg||
nt|reisig: it started with the 1@s response|pg||
nt|tsanders: not on same page if @ds are trumps|pg||
nt|bbramley: of course, one of my rules is: You can't overbid when you're cold for 7.|pg||
nt|migry: however the opposite rule also works|pg||
nt|tsanders: 5@hs not right response|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|reisig: maybe he'll use the .."look again" bid|pg||
nt|migry: if diamonds r trumps - but not for north:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mlodybog: I wouldn't like to sell out with Salomaa's hand so early (or so low)|pg||
nt|dburn: Considering what he might have had for 1@s, he has an awful lot|pg||
nt|mareczek: one black ace + diammond fit is enoug to 6@d|pg||
nt|swanson: an uninspired auction by the Finns|pg||
nt|csimon: very well done after the less than optimum start|pg||
nt|migry: here it comes:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pkl: Right - could not be traditional Lebensohl.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|reisig: 5N asked spec king |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|migry: still no results from the previous match:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Now Italy needs 12 for a blitz|pg||
nt|tsanders: south's 5nt found the @dK and was very helpful|pg||
nt|reisig: hard to believe ..but they may lose 2 IMPs for 7@d|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@C=@C + @D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|migry: and 4@d splinter|pg||

nt|reisig: 5@d seems likely here|pg||
nt|bg: spade partial here Belgium can pick up a few imps|pg||

nt|pkl: It is a clear opening in my system.|pg||
nt|vugraph197: he didnt , my misclick|pg||
nt|ritong: very strange, imposed by the system i guess|pg||
nt|vugraph197: but he passed it on opening sry|pg||
nt|coutred: Fantoni could have opened 2@S but maybe he is not allowed to do so with a minimum and 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: or by the operator:)|pg||
nt|pkl: Okay... let us all have sympathy with the operator..... it is not an easy job|pg||
nt|csimon: it fits within their 2-bid requirement|pg||
nt|vugraph197: he passed it on opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsanders: appears 4@hs can go down with a @c attack|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bbramley: i think dbl is "don't lead a diamond"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodybog: Risky one at that|pg||
nt|granguru: according to Zar North has 11(HC) +13 (dist)+ 3(ctrl)+1(@S suit) +1 concentration =29 |pg||
nt|granguru: 3 more than minimum!|pg||
nt|pkl: I agree with Zar - that hand is not absolute minimum|pg||
nt|granguru: so Fantoni is, in fact super conservative...|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: a  @c might beat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 3C is reasonable here, but partner is know to have a lot of major suits cards from the bidding|pg||
nt|pkl: And Nunes - bidding 3@S knows it!!|pg||
nt|bbramley: missed the message|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a relay |pg||
nt|swanson: 2@S was probably pass or correct.|pg||
nt|bg: 2s= relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H already showed hearts|pg||
nt|timb: i'd have passed 2@H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|migry: not sure about the double over 4@d - maybe it suggested sacrifice|pg||
nt|migry: certainly something is wrong when they double and lead:)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm very surprised duboin didn't bid 5@D. he could expect to pick up trumps and might have made with the club ace onside|pg||
nt|bbramley: maybe he thought his spades were good only for defense|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe bid 5@c and run to 5@d (to get @c lead)|pg||
nt|migry: 4@d does indeed suggest sacrifice so the pass is consistent with that decision to involve partner|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
