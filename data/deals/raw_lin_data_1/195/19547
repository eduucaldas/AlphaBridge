nt|brolucius: It was possible, from South's point of view that a slam might be there. It is a sound guideline in bidding, never to assume that partner will hold the perfect cards. They rarely ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: do.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should also be bid to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|brolucius: My partners have another very sound guideline: Never assume that your partner will play the hand perfectly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|20-22 bal|nt|odysseus69: 2D includes balance 20-22 I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|stayman|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D is the multi. 2@S shows a willingness to go to 3@H if that is partner's long suit. |pg||
mb|3H|an|5!h|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now west will have to motor|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East knows that partner has heart fit and values- |pg||
mb|4D|an|cue|nt|roswolf: on a 4@D cue e/w should get there|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: i assume a multi and 2S showed that West had some heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: One of the club discards is needed for a diamond discard, so declarer needs to take the spade finesse and to find a good heart position.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: rkbc SEEMS INDICATED|pg||
mb|r|an|1st round|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: now Gad will id RKC|pg||
nt|brolucius: To make 13 tricks, that is.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a hippy double by north|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble shows that the diamond control is 1st-round.|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKC|mb|p|mb|5H|an|2 of 5|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ignoring the fact that he gives a lot of info about the play of the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5NT next|pg||
mb|5N|an|0 K|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and when he finds no kings will stop in 6|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: diamond lead makes this tricky|pg||
nt|warrens:  there is a communication problem in @H's that doesn't exist in NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but if declarer plays only 2 rounds of trumps he is ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door Barry Myers took a conservative action - made no move over 3H -|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Barry Myers was not 74 IMPs behind?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he was 70+ imps up - this slam is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so comfortable on diamond lead - has to draw KQ of trumps and play top clubs and hope|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or finesse the spade?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is marginally against the odds that the doubleton club will be in the same hand as the doubleton trump. (Vacant Places).|pg||
nt|roswolf: south could falsecard with the trump jack on the first round of trumps if she senses the position|pg||
nt|odysseus69: other line may be better-spade finesse- both work - |pg||
nt|roswolf: true victor|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: I am told that it is a 42% chance that two hearts and two clubs lie together. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and spade finesse slightly better|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: The odds for a spade finesse are between 40 and 60, depending on how lucky a player you are.|pg||

nt|famus: hello everyone|pg||
nt|zebutin: France is trailing 7vp:s for 3rd place, so they are hungry for some points|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@C is a little exuberant|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaa |pg||
nt|ianmcc: some raise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  on this lead, 3NT is easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -ew has 5 @h/east !!  and 5 @d will come -for down 1 -but perhaps 5 @h makes in practise by west also|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|kaapo: Italy 2nd after R15, as they have been for the most of the tournament. Finland now 16th|pg||
nt|zebutin: Italy on the other hand is trying to catch up with israel for 1st|pg||
nt|runnerup: test passed |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I guess -4. You?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe less|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps this hand will help teach Chadha of the virtue of the "green card"|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I personally would open the hand 1 @D and try a 2 @C rebid |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 2@S was alerted here, but apparently shouldn't be|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but I am old fashioned about this stuff|pg||
nt|barbyh: yes thats the normal style|pg||
nt|lml: that seems the best to me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eugenio123: no problem to respect 2 @h maybe one overtrick|pg||

nt|jaheim: 5 kløver kan virke fristende,  men blir dyrt|pg||
nt|patricck: I'll predict 9 tricks, but it might be only 8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eleni: I am sorry 3rd round|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
nt|kaapo: A quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco might have promised stronger hand than this with his bidding, or might be just normal youngsters friskines on both parties|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they need a good win now if they want to chalenge Israel....good for moral as well|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry, choæ w Polsce ma³o pogodny:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zazwyczaj mecze Polska - Izrael grane s¹ o wy¿sze stawki ni¿ dzisiaj - Izrael jest liderem, Polska zamyka pierwsz¹ 10-kê|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice switch, now where is @c10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Declarer thinking long and hard here|pg||
nt|sybarra: we were all thinking 3  @C so this is a struggle |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no double no trouble|pg||
nt|ianmcc: bad raise to game esp as 2@c could be 3 and anyway not forcing (I assume)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Opening 1N?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bmkl: Goodmorning everyone, wlcm to the 3rd round of Juniors Championships|pg||
nt|ybob: hard lead to S , only @H lead was Ok|pg||

nt|vugraphzjx: Scoltock apologising|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|famus: Denmark has been catapulting with great display of bridge understanding at this level--This is a very important match for them|pg||
nt|famus: I presume 3@ds was routine rev bergen|pg||
nt|zebutin: Sadly i don't know anything about italian pair, Kytömaa&Vallivaara are both students in university of Oulu|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|bmkl: same as in open tbl|pg||
nt|arigun: @s mecuber 1 tur daha boslayacak 10 love olacak|pg||
nt|stevedr: good defense for -1|pg||
nt|loe48: ja var godt aa ikke proeve den|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: No, rebid of 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good switch not giving declarer a chance to make:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is Scoltock apologising for?|pg||
nt|patricck: beats me|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Not having enough for his bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Apparently|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok fine, but great shape  (thats usually my line) |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 3@S has been explained as forcing by Stoltock|pg||
pc|h2|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
nt|rado: declarer might produce 9 tricks but brobably defence will be 1st with 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: E playing 1NT in the open room....|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we will start with a swing...|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand young superstar Madala is playing, who has played almost every round of the tournament|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand = other room|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcwla: But here they're just in run-out-the-clock mode presumably.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||
nt|dkkello: Yes but still some work to do|pg||
nt|runnerup: a little suprice that ns didnt bid 5 @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ntmon: 11 tricks|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bmkl: makeable, not easy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Terve|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankbo: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, a bit passive|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of work for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: now declarer seems to have 2@D+2@S+3@C+@H eventually, and then opponents have setting trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be too much work :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ybob: now @H to discard later @D|pg||
nt|bagman: Kytömaa's opening was a bit on the light side considering the position and vulnerability but he's not going to be badly punished|pg||
nt|runnerup: so there was one good point from east activeness -there are in -bad point is that this is -1 -still can no big lost |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe cashing some hts first?  |pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, 5@C was a bad call. With the great shape I can understand wanting to bid more than 3@C though. 4@C would also be too high but wouldn't be such a bad call|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would not occur to me to open 1@c, and I surely would not bid 2@s|pg||

nt|sybarra2: plus the @D tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra2: can this really make?|pg||
nt|henryb:  What 2 tricks, Shirley?|pg||
nt|lml: if declarer concedes the club instead of finessing then think he's fine.  Ruff a heart hook the diamond.  spades hook diamond|pg||
nt|lml: that seems the logical approach|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lets suppose N switches to a @s. Declarer has to win and take a @d finesse|pg||

nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am here on night leave|pg||

nt|lady007: 1N did seem to go down, but i cant blame him for bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which suggests north has to x with that hand perhaps|pg||

nt|barbyh: 3 hearts |pg||

nt|barbyh: am I on another planet?|pg||
nt|lml: North was responding not opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  many play that is a splinter. And that hand is far to strong for a preemptive 3@h|pg||
nt|barbyh: oh srry didnt see the opening bid|pg||
nt|lml: I thought you didn't :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, I think 4@h should show solid hearts|pg||

nt|kaapo: Someone had the oppinion that if a 14 count is good enough for a 15-17 1NT, it's good enough to accept :)|pg||
nt|daman: a  @D will let him make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||

nt|yusufb: atak sayýsý biraz garip|pg||
nt|friggi: 14-16 3rd, that can be the reason for stopping|pg||
nt|runnerup: this could be the first pass ..i have seen ...:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this is it -ew must let declare take 1 @c trick 2. perhaps and some 2-down -east has no entry otherwise,but not easy for west to lead that|pg||
nt|daman: @D9 = 0 or 2 higher|pg||
nt|sybarra: Myers who was late to the table first set....up 61 and bored? |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe 2@h could be brought home by EW|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, maybe. The Dutch EW are going to try that now :)|pg||
nt|panosk: to be fair with open cards is not a great bargain , 4h that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 10 count fit raise,  so ...half the deck |pg||

nt|zebutin: seems here is another 3nt, this time most likely making with 3@C+ 4@S+@D and 1-2 @H tricks...with @D lead might make even more diamond tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: that 5 @h -contract was the same-lead the same but +1 in other room -strange -so 13 for Israel|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky 4 @s here |pg||
nt|daman: very lucky|pg||
nt|ianmcc: inspired|pg||
nt|henryb:  but it is a "three-loser" hand|pg||
nt|lml: borderline with the @SK not so hot|pg||
nt|jcwla: So is "what's your sign?" - about equally effective.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
nt|liraren: natural weak 2@d|pg||
nt|ybob: X and over suit at low level, bids @D |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most teams playing in 3N board 3 it seems|pg||
nt|runnerup: here nobody can make anything big -perhaps not even any little|pg||
nt|arigun: tablonun uzerinde istediginiz kategoriye tiklayip canli sonuclara bakabiliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club with transfers for NS, right?|pg||
nt|antoniz: sorry -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@H også i OR|pg||
nt|jaheim: en meget god start for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in West already in 3nt....QD lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: N spade suit not even good for poke |pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C some Bergen raise ?|pg||
nt|tez: 5 de kalmýþ öbür masa:(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes  a lot of trf :)|pg||
nt|bambik: to wunika z tzw rozluznienia szansa ze piki 3-0 jest minimalna ale mozna sie nad nia zastanowic|pg||
nt|daman: running scores    http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=891|pg||
nt|sybarra: *poker|pg||
nt|henryb:  We certainly can't complain about the computer's dealing for us|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @h4+|pg||
nt|stevedr: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 piki skurczybyki|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope! |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: Missing all TOP honours , I would definitely hesitate to Open a weak two in first seat  |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden seems to have given up strong club and shifted to this system instead|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm    Myers might complain on this board|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, I would pre-empt 3@H at that vulnerability, and yes I can see it didn't work out too well. That is bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 3@H "allowed to be 6"|pg||
nt|patricck: i guess NS must have a fair shot at 3NT though|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not close to anything more than a constructive raise with flat distribution.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes its the new swedish club ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Myers is going out for some fresh air here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||
nt|ybob: pass works fine to collect 200|pg||
nt|ybob: and probably down 1 in 4m|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla will pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
nt|panosk: E unbloched the 10@S 1st round of spades so dummy spades were good, only 1 entry needed then|pg||
nt|daman: good bid by East|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead from N? i might prefer passive @S|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D pictures most likely behind declarer, Jx doesn't look promising, and A10x isnt going anywhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: or thats my thinking on lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: these yuongsters just bids those games|pg||
nt|daman: fearless|pg||
pc|hA|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||
nt|rado: French top player Alain Levy recommends to seek for Major lead when unbid Majors at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: interesting lead|pg||
nt|bambik: na drugim stole po pierwszorecznym pasie i otwarciu przez Bytryna 1 trefl i interwencji 2 Pik Natalka golnela 4 kiery i 3 impy z niczego|pg||

pc|h6|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i bid X with S cards and go down|pg||
nt|dkkello: anyone for dbl  3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||

nt|yusufb: kotu atak oldu|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  She knows that partner doesnt have extras and 3@h|pg||
nt|friggi: 1@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, I believe EW use 3rd/5th leads so @D2 is usually from 5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
nt|tez: 11 puanla þlem daveti bile yapmadý..ortakta iyi bir 22 bile olmaz diye düþündü|pg||

nt|sybarra: true patric |pg||
nt|sybarra: always prefer to have the straight flush |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||
nt|eleni: yes and then smolen|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H you most likely hit partners major suit, but he can't have too much points when you have 10...|pg||
nt|zebutin: but could work out with some combinations|pg||
nt|runnerup: he showed length -ok i see -high from 3 :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think this contract has problems|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: @h küçük çýkýlabilirdi|pg||

nt|juan lukas: 9 imps for france probably after the @h switch |pg||

nt|zebutin: so @D honor lead in other room and small @D here, no love for majors :(|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested @D 9 continuation|pg||
nt|zebutin: which would be really sneaky|pg||
nt|bebechira: France has 4 tricks..so another imp on the way|pg||
nt|lechcold: rozdanie nieoczywiste dla obu stron|pg||
nt|panosk: 7 wud do the trick too|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ntmon: rise with @DA, @C, and ruff a @C |pg||
nt|lechcold: Lhuissier mia³ prawo liczyæ na lepsz¹ kartê partnera. 5@S mnie nie dziwi|pg||
nt|lml: the 4@h bill is going to work out well.  North had the right cards|pg||
pc|d8|nt|galois85: 1@s is double without majors?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1@s is trf to 1Nt with bal or weak with a minor|pg||

nt|ianmcc: but maybe not he played 5@c very nicely|pg||
nt|patricck: @C at trick 3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good play to duck the first @S - now North has at least one entry for @C-shift|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he should see that cl was not good there|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they need to right the ship |pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe beginning|pg||
nt|loe48: kan se ut som om meldingen her ogsaa er preget av en dose tran for mye|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
nt|zebutin: but then J could cover, if singelton honor takes it 654 against H3 is enough|pg||
nt|henryb:  Right. I thought the @d2 would come back to haunt him|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: -2 next|pg||
nt|lml: and a max|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: nothing fancy in the end: declarer likely to make his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: this will be OK because trumps were 3-3, but it would have been interesting idf they were 4-2|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|runnerup: to play @c was like surrender here i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  HAD one entry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: doðu sýkýþacak|pg||

pc|h4|nt|yusufb: atak bulamadý|pg||
nt|tez: iyi oluyor boyle cengiz..seyirciler mutlu oluyor biz bilemeyince:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I also play like that. Trouble with the method is that with 4-4 in the majors it's easy to lose the @S fit, especially if opponents interfere like this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||
nt|ahri:  north didn't have a problem as south returned high heart to show spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||

mb|2S|nt|mamos: everyone cuebidding :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||

nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||

nt|jaheim: tipper vest tenker på 2 nt|pg||

nt|rodal f: Har E til 4 nå?|pg||
nt|patricck: trump is the standard lead against this bidding sequence|pg||

nt|jcwla: Note S raises just one level with pd a passed hand - just bidding to fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Small just said he was "well endowed"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Without the @D-lead, the @C-suit might have brought North the 8th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: all players agreed with that comment...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt=min no 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: less appetising to lead from the Q@H of course, but South knew what to do|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for france|pg||
nt|zebutin: needs to quess @H right to have any chance at this... when J or Q drops its much better odz that  Rubino has other honor...but then you are always losing 1 @H trick|pg||
nt|panosk: y matter of overtrics now, he shudnt try for too many :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR enda 3@CN|pg||
pc|dT|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer plays low and there's no good move for W|pg||
nt|jkotor: ta jest panie komendancie !|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: When was the Häxan convention invented, Johan, do you know?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Was it before or after Gazzilli?|pg||

nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested passing 1@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR enda 4@S. Sansynligvis med -1, men.....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||

nt|mamos: less excitment (not that Bowles team will care)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have raised to 2@s. Shows what I know|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 10 tricks |pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe he wants to make it harder for EW to balance|pg||
nt|zebutin: which would seem reasonable with (sub)minimum opening|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like same score at this room|pg||
nt|bebechira: flat board... Di Franco chose not to take the money|pg||
nt|jkotor: sekwencja inwitowa i zapiera uzgodniony w licytacji ci¹gnik|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't like singletons with only 1 trump but this one works|pg||
nt|sybarra: not enough spots in the @s suit for 1 thing |pg||
nt|sybarra: any one for bidding 4 @H over 3 nt?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe for them that means something else |pg||
nt|ianmcc: don't like 3NT what's the hurry|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|ianmcc: come on East @h2|pg||
nt|patricck: After the @H ruff West should switch to a club, there is a safety play in trumps if declarer knows the @D finesse works|pg||
nt|sybarra: I might even "invent" a 2 bid,  to see what pard says |pg||
nt|ianmcc: these guys bid like the Watsons but dfeend like Garozzo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but they do not play 2/1 |pg||
nt|jcwla: The idea is if E d/n have enough to raise, it is usually very hard for the W hand to come to 8 tricks since they're playing everything out of their own hand.  Not the case here b/c ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: of the noted major pushers in dummy.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
nt|tez: 5@h diyecek..6 ya gelecekler|pg||
nt|famus: a good4@S|pg||

nt|galois85: double dummy this can be make|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like comfortable make, so some more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The cards are nicely with @H 3-3, @S 3-2 and both rounded suit aces onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there another around  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||
nt|bebechira: influenced by the vulnerability for sure|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|arigun: ilk baord'dan anladigimiz kadariyla KG midi Nt oynuyorlar 12-14 civari birsey|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
nt|arigun: dolayisiyla bu sekanlari muhtemelen 12-14 dengesiz bir el vaadediyor 1@d-1@s-2@s yani|pg||
nt|kaapo: A couple of @C ruffs should do it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  see if the bidding helps him to do that|pg||
nt|galois85: sice spades are 3-3 one can just lose I spade, 3 diamonds and the club... |pg||
nt|friggi: decl must asume that @C are 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah well, maybe it needs getting the clubs right to avoid promotions|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer just needs to capitalize his good luck|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
nt|henryb:  sure, low heart to Q now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes we can see |pg||

nt|jcwla: Bowles and Hinden did stop in a @D partial on 26 so 10 more to OMC there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 22 IMPs in the first two boards just what the doctor ordered.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Results page is here: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|runnerup: if @h finess is on -then 2-2 diamond is ok or no club loosers -so perhaps 6 @d is the one anyway--but both tables in 3nt -so thats for that |pg||

pc|d6|nt|eugenio123: ahaha|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = strong hand supp 3° ...|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Again, 1@D is shoing 4+@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W might sacrefise in 4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to land in 4 @H here |pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has chances -best defence baets but can be home if best not found|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes , Dennis BIlde shifted to a @C in open room in trick 2 , made it "easy" , but 3x @H |pg||
nt|yusufb: iyi atak yaptý|pg||
nt|zebutin: this was maybe little unexpected development|pg||
nt|kaapo: This may not be a good way to do it, either|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 imps saved |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
nt|jaheim: 3 nt med 10x i kl var heller ikke allverden da|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR sliter også på B6|pg||

nt|ianmcc: North responded 2@h in other room. Lucky (tho better)|pg||
nt|henryb:  very aggressive raise by Bowles of partner's opening 1N|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|ybob: no if it, declares play AK @S and run @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: and win too|pg||
nt|frankbo: great score for sweden|pg||
nt|lml: well done to get to the decent slow|pg||
nt|lml: and the best kind ... it makes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||

nt|juan lukas: if 3 rounds in @h , declarer trump , play AK @s then @d no ? |pg||

nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sac? |pg||
nt|sybarra: need more that guts |pg||
nt|andreasw:  depends on what dbl shows.. if it shows suit and lead or just lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||

nt|vasmar: only if W overcalls in @D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Wd bye E here|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table Madala passed as South over the double, and West's 1@D didn't show any values|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here west was able to show something by doubling 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Danish declarer went 2 down in 6@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: in @H is missing 2 aces/5, so will not be bidding slam in that|pg||

nt|tejjyid: *deduce|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, heart deuce|pg||
nt|ady: may refuse club finesse though|pg||
nt|ady: club finesse wrong   then loses 2 hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk5: For some reason he cashed @CAK and @HA before he played a diamond to the ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: as N, you can bid 3 @C  |pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems to me W took about a minute too long there.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: *can't|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (some keyboard problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes he pitched 4@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I assume at least one of the @S cards played by South was count - but maybe not from the time North is taking|pg||
nt|cicus: not easy for N to recollect available information which may have been contradictory|pg||
nt|ritong: this is the tough life of the kibitzer  we know any of his cards beat it, but have to wait for his decision|pg||

mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||

nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||

nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||

nt|antoniz: dobry wist na -1|pg||
nt|henryb:  see you after I break my fast|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kaapo: EW play mini NT when vulnerable so West has max 9 HCP|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good stop:)|pg||
nt|stevedr: winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|stevedr: they need to hear, good stop, wins 15 :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: delikatnie to powiedzia³e Apku|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||
nt|tez: defans en zor yeri briçin..en zevklisi ayný zamanda|pg||
nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make this for a 5 IMP gain for Finland|pg||
nt|veistikke:  haha|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D kanskje alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: sacma bi iþ yaptý|pg||
nt|panosk: with what spades ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
nt|barbyh: think I wd redble than bid 2hts|pg||
nt|jcwla: Last board of the set here, thanks to Roland Wald, our excellent VG operator Mark Reeve, David Edwin and Hans Werge for their usual keen insights, and to all kibs.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
nt|runnerup: a bit lucky once again -normally @c lead beats this -not now|pg||
nt|daman: he has to play it wide open so it will make|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time just  take all from top -basic curs +1 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all,  shortly |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Still playing in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Back in 10 mins|pg||
nt|ady: thx Jordan      thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 1@S promises an unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
nt|patricck: trying to make 12 tricks will probably result in making only 10|pg||
nt|lml: I just think South has too much to preempt and the fact partner coudl have four hearts makes the preempt less attractive|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
nt|kaapo: Especially after this switch|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale widzê, ¿e lêku nie ma te¿ D¯essi jnr|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
nt|friggi: not the best switch|pg||
nt|stevedr: probably still push with h return|pg||
nt|rodal f: Detta gikk illi fort:)|pg||
nt|lml: you cant even have the law level excuse|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's hand is close between 2N Truscott and something less forceful|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 1@H is frequently a 4 card suit in a weak NT|pg||
nt|lml: I am told by a spec that they think 3@H was limit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
nt|runnerup: it was too greedy to open here 4. seat|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7 OR ended 1NTS|pg||
nt|jaheim: men 6 hj  med ett "ess",  her hj K, borte,  er beste kontrakt,   som vanlig fra Israel.|pg||
nt|henryb:  If limit then North would surely have bid 4@h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be - 2 yes. a draw :P |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, a much safer line for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
nt|bagman: good time for espresso :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye all|pg||
nt|lml: it seems that it was prremptive|pg||
nt|lml: thanks |pg||
nt|barbyh: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 3@H was pre-emptive|pg||
nt|lml: and bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: according to McGuire|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Stopping for lunch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: Back again in a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: With Bowles leading by 74 IMPs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In his next life, South would for sure unblock the @D King at he first trick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|tez: ortaðýnýn ne dönmesi gerektiðini söylemeli|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||
nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
nt|patricck: well for 10 tricks really, but makes 11 when the @C are found to be 3-3|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
nt|tez: hala @c kaybý duruyor..batacak|pg||
pc|c3|nt|antoniz: kier i karo,bez Damy karo u partnera nie ob³o¿ymy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: As for how OMC feel about the deficit? "Ooh baby / it's making me crazy / every time I look around / every time I look around / every time I look around / it's in my face."|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kan vi gjøre annet en å skryte over bridgeferdigheten til Israel de senere år? Nei. De blir sikkert like gode på annet plan over tid.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
nt|bambik: pamietam jak w dawnych czasach jeden z graczy w kolko powiedzial zeby slabo wchodzic trzeba miec gruby portfel ale teraz w rozdaniach komputerowych z reguly jakis fit sie znajdzie|pg||
nt|daman: 11 IMPs back to Italy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr mente selvfølgelig: JA|pg||
nt|loe48: han tenker naa om west laa unna med kxx|pg||
nt|loe48: han er redd for hj og ny hj naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7 OR 6@HS|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 mente eg|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja   må vurdere det opp mot Kxxx  i kutt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Gratis capp eller drop?|pg||
nt|loe48: i think he is going to play small h|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
mc|11|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pg||
