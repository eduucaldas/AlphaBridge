nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes, bd 1 is a push, CR playing same boards as us|pg||

nt|ianmcc: hi rashed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: A nice third-seat weak 2 if available.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: partial for N/S but they could get higher|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c bergen I think|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: 1@D misguided in third seat.  It's their hand - put some pressure on.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now, let's talk about this double -- or the lack of a double by the N hand in similar situations.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats what i call trump support |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and does, finally a 10 point opener gets a good result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beegen raise I expect|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bergen|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: and S decided he likes his hand a lot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C was bergen as I look at it and S upgraded his hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they need this trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D Ace and @H back:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  the defense should be pretty easy as long as W doesn't get overly anxious and cashes out early|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: looks like -1 again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep   could be -2 if they can get second ruff |pg||
nt|panosk: @D2 now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd ruff = the same 2 trump tricks he started with?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: You and your favorite partner need to have agreement on what it means: does it ask for a @D lead (so that if you don't double you are suggesting a different lead) or does it say "I ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: have a 2@D rebid that they stole"?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcwla: I prefer the latter meaning and trust that pd will lead my suit in the absence of a clearly better alternative; however, I do have some pds who require the double if I want the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: lead of that suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: Again, remembering Precision context|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|d2|nt|panosk: bad break in trumps 4@H had no chance gd game though|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  at 50 a pop, down 1 or 2 shouldn't make much difference as it's almost impossible to stop in 2@s or 2@h with the NS hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: probably another push |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good unblock N after his good lead|pg||

pc|h7|pc|sT|pc|h5|pg||
mc|8|nt|jcwla: Right - here, it is clearly showing @D length.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S didn't open on 11 eventually gained 2 imps for his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well it is not like there are not potential losses from failing to identify a 5-bagger major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  HongMian on roll having scored the last 24 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: routine 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  there must by some system glich for W not to be able to show a weak hand with the majors|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S will run to 3@c...then the fun should begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: And end - with 3@D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: doesnt N have a michaels bid or something?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E better that a 2@S raise 3 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nope, both of us are wrong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, my prediction was conditional upon yours.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: EW only reached 3@S so just 1 imp|pg||
nt|blewah: NS play prec|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  ok, so the run was to 4@c...I was just premature|pg||
nt|kemperg: no transfers on weak 1NT and no Stayman relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  but also some form of bergen |pg||
nt|panosk: N has a 2@H bid i think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||
nt|blewah: OK, as a spec's information, they play weak NT and 4+@d, so N decided to pass in the previous board|pg||
nt|blewah: 13-15NT to be precised|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S would pull to 4@C or 3NT to play?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable lead and all over.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we call ours Truscott in Acol 1@S-3@S = good raise to 2|pg||
nt|panosk: i like hearts :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but as passed hand,  you need a tool with that hand|pg||

nt|rnmalik: yes,  difficult.|pg||
nt|blewah: but what options does he have?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: 2@S worked very well for EW here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blewah: likely 8 trick already available for cdecl|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: wow.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jcwla: Who gets the charge there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  mastercard|pg||
nt|andyv:  no charge...NS very aggressive...didn't work|pg||
nt|andyv:  this hand a bit testy for NS....need to stop low or defend|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: S has a nice hand in context of the X  -- arguably didn't give pd a lot of leeway but possibly N could show 2-suiter instead?|pg||
nt|panosk: constructive bids shud stay lower, in my opinion|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree panos |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no opening S no preempt W|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: routine hand.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might make 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you have to have discussion with pard,  as to what bids mean as passed hand |pg||
nt|rnmalik: any major suit contract losing 3 aces only:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think S passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That low:)|pg||
nt|blewah: pass?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  doubld dummy 4@c probably only goes down one|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  right Rashed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: alas|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: disappointing|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe one of the few pairs in the world that can stop at 2@c|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: undo pl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think E bid 5@s|pg||
nt|panosk: double or 3@S with W hand?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I prefer double|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: no remedy for being conservative and losing a vul game.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzku: sry|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sry:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it's the first time i do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except when pard misreads it|pg||
nt|sybarra: that maybe is result of X |pg||
nt|sybarra: W had best find 4 @S (imo)|pg||
nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
nt|blewah: and they are minotities in this world of modern bidding|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|blewah: minorities|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||
nt|andyv:  was S hand worth a 3@c bid with this vul?|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems bad but no problems now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even now makes.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: @D switch.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  with everyon play 2way new minor and xyz and pdq, etc....2@c has almost become non existent as a spot to play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: depends on  meaning of the dbl|pg||
nt|jcwla: We know from 14 that the double promises short @C's|pg||
