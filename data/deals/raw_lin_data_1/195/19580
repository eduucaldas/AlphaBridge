nt|frankaus: maybe 4@S over 41H will get a @S lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible.|pg||
nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: this board should be shown to those who claims not to open weak 2 with Hxx in the other major :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello  all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the contract was 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||

nt|frankaus: expecting  - 3rg try :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3@S may be passed and would be a good board for NL.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
nt|leao:  stiff ace claimed its toll|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar with the North hand|pg||
nt|thak: but all games by NS doomed to failure |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I agree and learnt at very late stage:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the count in the @C immediately known after trick one|pg||

nt|sybarra: 0708 in Washington DC |pg||
nt|riccho:  hi shirley :) |pg||
nt|leao:  i like 5@h|pg||
nt|thak: one of the popular treatments here is to play 2N/3x as constructive with 2@S being a start of signoff sequence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||

nt|daman: he can claim 7|pg||
nt|figo: though with entries in W hand , S x was also ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: yes|pg||
nt|pinticus: yesm10 iMPs board 1 for Italy and 1 iMP board 2|pg||
nt|leao:  the other table bid 6@h oo last hand... less effective preempt there|pg||

nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the 6@H slam is on his mind|pg||
nt|daman: this would be awful if the bid slam and went down|pg||
nt|daman: they*|pg||
nt|leao:  yep. very bad for morale|pg||
nt|leao:  and at the onset of the match too|pg||
nt|sybarra: watched their big brothers on the jr team |pg||
nt|bobholl: brave bidding is rewarded :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: and let's be fair it surely is in the 50% RANGE|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Rimstedt twins signed off in 4h... good chance for Israel|pg||
nt|figo: EW play transfer +ve methods|pg||

pc|c6|nt|leao:  argh|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||

pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: 9@H a value card.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey |pg||
nt|serhat: hi Champ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  so they start with a 20+ IMP deficit to recover|pg||
nt|leao:  have a nice one|pg||
nt|leao:  sandwich, i mean|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||

pc|h6|nt|antoniz: teoretycznie-podzia³ pików 3-3 i impas karo to 10 lew|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||

pc|h7|nt|panosk: shud also be carefull of clubs as he/she knows that S is 5-4 at aleast hence no more than 3-4 cards in rest suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  W loves to open 1 Nt on many hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: Funny cards. Where to stop.|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but last board was a plus for the opening of 2@H|pg||
nt|chrisky: i dont like the 1nt call|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause to start there was no chance except defensive mistake ,but that came|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h seems cold for EW here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||
nt|loe48: west is inviting to 3nt now with thoose 11 hps..as i personally would downgrade to bid 1nt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x appropriate |pg||

nt|veistikke:  with 14 points I would have said 4@h for sure :P|pg||
nt|sybarra: but coaches say "focus on hand in front of you"  (not always easy to do)|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: a very flat hand with lot of holes|pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  but I play that as 8-11 5crd|pg||

nt|leao:  but the entries in dummy are scarce|pg||
nt|leao:  bou no matter; he only needs one anyway|pg||
nt|daman: playing the ace would be appropriate      N has shown AKQ of @Ds andthe KQ of @S  and   if S has the @S Q   then the trumps have to be drawn with greater urgency|pg||
nt|leao:  i agree with that. theres a  nice case for the ace play|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes Shirley... it is fantastic... BBO changed the way we think about bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3@C is puppet stayman |pg||
nt|bebechira: BBO became a spectators game as well... and very instructive|pg||
nt|sybarra: bbo has certainly enabled a lot of people to see the very best players in the world |pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 or T makes a lot of trick difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a matter of overtricks |pg||
nt|bobholl: true but more than 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|figo: so dble was both majors here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: even if trump were play, maybe def could shift to @c to restrict to 9 tricks, declarer has too much work to do|pg||

nt|daman: 3NT -3 in the OR was mildly aggressive|pg||

mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||
nt|pinticus: so it is 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H diff to make imagine E trying for highet as he shud|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
nt|suketbombi: needs to get @HS right in any slam they bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

pc|d7|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
nt|pinticus: 4@s OR EW|pg||

nt|le joker: @c lead go down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||
nt|sybarra: ideal bid would be 4 @D as cue and spade raise, (on the way to game) |pg||
nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||

nt|daman: not really|pg||
nt|daman: make 5 then|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: 4@c was alert bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: since we know the cards 6@H & 6 Nt will be far superior than 6@C other things being equal does not need @C break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the strain here is right but the level is wrog but who knows the luck may smile at them with 13 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: anamd will not bother much about the % in slam will bang ace and back @H|pg||
pc|c9|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||
nt|sybarra: record would have fallen Richard|pg||

pc|cK|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is a useful convention here: XX here from E would show doubt about the contract |pg||
nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||
nt|daman: win the @C and play the @S 10|pg||

nt|bebechira: 1 h, 2 d and 1c looks obvious|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If E plays @DK first then 6.|pg||

nt|sybarra: but good shift by Israel |pg||
nt|bobholl: more spectacle to come :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes indeed and new leader|pg||
pc|sT|nt|timverbeek:  hmm this is wrongly played by Petersen|pg||
nt|yuval10: but W didn't find the @h shift|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  3x spade is safe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|saverio: but it is not tha case here|pg||
nt|antoniz: prosi³ partner o wist pik, to czemu w karo|pg||

nt|z_lasu: przy tej rozgrywce dobrze ze nie graja koncowki|pg||
nt|saverio: ?????  no overruff?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good defence so far. another @H would defeat the contract.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but without the heart switch no problems, if she ruffs and plays @SA and @SJ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: why didn't zazzà over-ruffed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the cards are flying sry |pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: didnt find it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we'll see|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzjs: they both agree on 10 tricks :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bebechira: in the juniors Italy seems locked in 2nd... so Agustin and co. will go home will the silver... |pg||
pc|hA|nt|gronkvist:  yes after the ruffit was odd to finesse directly|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|serhat: plus 1-3 H and 2-4 C distr also helps may be all together more then 50%|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: spoke too soon :(|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: even if dec had single @hA, @hQ cannot be wrong|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|pelu: again this 1Nt (forcing or semiforcing) and bad result - I dont like that convention :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, 7-loser hand. A single raise can't cover 4 of them|pg||
nt|panosk: i like 1nt from W rather than 2@S , many and i play it as a spade fit hand that wont tolerate a game try|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: It's not the 1NT that causes the problem; it's the raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Panos what will u bid on 9-10 with short @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 1NT is forcing, bid 2@D and you get out in 2@S|pg||

nt|sybarra: frankly it is just one of those magic hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h must show  values and a super @d-fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he bid 1 nt, (2 suited presumably)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: that why I would be nervous |pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may play 4 sp |pg||
nt|bebechira: south has a hand to double some  high contract for sure|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lotte will bid 5c and the double will come.... but not enough to match 910|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they make +1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question is did W promise 5 @S? |pg||
nt|bobholl: just losing 1@S and 1C not that difficult|pg||

nt|bebechira: lol true|pg||
nt|bobholl: still a support X ??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to me, no comment is trivial, so thanks all|pg||
nt|tlc: 3@h being a splinter, obviously promising no extra values|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@H splinter raise in @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|loe48: this hand again is almost to good for a weak 2 opener, rather 1s-2s hand|pg||
nt|saverio: since they bid usually 1 or 2 tricks more it shouldnt be difficult for them to get there :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to click pass....but i should :(|pg||

nt|eugenio123: olè another dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: E could help them :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok guys,  we need to get the system notes in the right order! |pg||
nt|veistikke:  what is south thinking about? :S|pg||
nt|le joker: i think it's W|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we said, the OR score would not be duplicated |pg||

nt|bebechira: another coffee hand... |pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Useful convention|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam is not that bad - on a non @S-lead u dont need @DK onside, and on a @S lead ud can set up @SJ to discard a @D - but u need @Hs 2-2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think we have discussed this before. 4@d is for me @dK and not a singleton|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if it is openers longer suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For me it is Last Train, a convention devised by Jeff Meckstroth|pg||

nt|sybarra: what I told, the 3 @S showed wk spades,  but my question is why not support hts? |pg||
nt|daman: since N had pitched all of the @Cs    the @H finesse was free|pg||

nt|raghavan: Cue has started |pg||
nt|tlc: 3@S would be my choice as well|pg||
nt|figo: wont take too long |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I hope he didnt think a)  3 sp forcing or b) pard could read his mind re 4 @H in his hand |pg||
nt|riccho:  say it that way: A partnership should resolve the problem to avoid a @s-contract in Bd 10 anyhow. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i disagree with E's pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think several others (such as Richie Reisig) says same |pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale 1@d wykluczam, tam jest mo¿e 8-9 PC|pg||
nt|serhat: N should bid definately last hand. dbl or 4h both fine for me as he has D tolerans|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
nt|jkotor: a co s¹dzimy o Pasie?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
nt|champ i: h as la baþlarsa batýyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||

nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||

nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
nt|bobholl: what to bid as S i almost have pity with S :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot... incredible|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead in the OR |pg||
pc|cA|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
nt|antoniz: jednak trochê blokuje przeciwników i partner wie gdzie jestemy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next please :)|pg||
nt|tlc: dont you wish someone could just tell declarer that :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland is not getting too much cricket.. bad weather in London|pg||
nt|serhat: 1h=@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 4+@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||

nt|rnmalik: good switch.|pg||
nt|leao:  Peter, our operator tells us that 3@s is a moderate hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: the important test England-India will be affected by the english weather|pg||

pc|s8|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

nt|riccho:  A10xx in @c ...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  yeah seems logical|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps for Reiter here... may be some imp|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They don't|pg||

nt|yuval10: 6@s from N should be interesting...will E find the A@h lead and continuation?|pg||
nt|serhat: but 32-32 is not good for them|pg||

nt|figo: 1NT = 4 spades , 7-8 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||

nt|sybarra: this hand will not be easy |pg||
nt|bebechira: and more imps for Lotte now?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||
nt|eugenio123: that's just another way to see this game|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  WD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D would be disturbing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we call it "not fun" |pg||
nt|mich-b: I would prefer a "trap pass" with East , playing for penalties...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bravo zazzà|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  think you might be right |pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: Though likely to be difficult, quantum of 25 points is there for a3NT |pg||
