nt|andyv:  19-120 2NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: East is calculating I think.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this would be a fun contract|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: There is no EW card close by.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No fun for N-S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: slam makes but this -lets see how much|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  W has 7 easy winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or EW - making 6@h|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  S saved somewhat by N's holding in @c suit...if E had that holding, we are talking much more than a slam|pg||

nt|Walddk2: same|pg||
mc|8|nt|andyv:  and hope W misguessed end position|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many will stay out of slam, so making would have been great|pg||
nt|andyv:  W mistimed the play in the majors|pg||
nt|runnerup: it was quite a decisin to pass 3 @c xx -with sing anyway -|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E had played a @s before @h, the @h entry and another @s had endplayed W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Carl Mathiesen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the curious thing is 3@c makes on brute force....W could lead @cs at every opportunity...A@C and low @C followed later by J@c would have given the defense 3 @c tricks and @D but nothing else|pg||
nt|sharkey: good morning|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Either 0-7 or 17+|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Carl|pg||

nt|Vugraph814: Unfortunately I can't tell you the EW explanations.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They not speaking Dutch??|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: 1nt -it was .now at least +100 to ew |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Complain!|pg||
nt|andyv:  S fortunate lack of double...now needs to hold contract to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: The problem is mainly that my Swedish is not good enough yet.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  Marc, you have to move to London to improve your Swedish|pg||
pc|d6|nt|staffffan:  write down what it sounds like, and we will interprete it:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy language  TV = TV   radio = radio   telephone = telefon     häst = horse    what is the problem?|pg||

nt|Vugraph814: The firewall of the LAN went down so no connections available. Should be OK now for the rest of the day, I hope.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|petka: here EW probably play artificial double over 1NT. A "standard" double would have been better, since NS will make 1N now by setting up the diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petka: and now even more tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tommy Gullberg has 14 national titles to his name, and hence the most winning ibndividual player in Sweden|pg||
nt|petka: over a double E might bid 2C or 2H, both better than defending 1N with a spade lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't the defense get 7 tricks first (2@d, 2@s and 3@h)?|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: EW play DONT over 1NT.|pg||
nt|petka: not now|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can't switch to @h?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|petka: west can switch to a high heart after diamond jack. Not sure if it is possible to find this play looking at 98xx in dummy|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  there didn't seem any reason for W to cash the A@d|pg||

pc|c9|nt|andyv:  I think the @h play is automatic whether in mp or imps|pg||

nt|ralfwil: the problem for W is that E didn´t signal clear enough|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|petka: that I can agree with.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://db.svenskbridge.se/info/s90-54.htm for running scores. N-S now almost 4% ahead of second|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka: In practice, W didn't find the HK at trick 3. Perhaps it is a mental thing, easier to find at IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: EW card: 'moderna dubblingar'. I don't know if that includes support doubles.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @d9 followed by @d7 is highest suit and @d9 followed by @d4 for lowest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|petka: the spade continuation certainly looked very odd|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Not again ........|pg||
nt|andyv:  +150 for NS may be a so so score|pg||

nt|petka: will gullberg put all his money on 2-2 trumps or club ace doubleton? he certainly might judge E to have some minor cards considering that W will not have 4S and east did not ...|pg||
nt|petka: support to 3H and did not rebid his spades|pg||
