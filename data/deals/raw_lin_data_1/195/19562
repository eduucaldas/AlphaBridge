nt|rv:  potentially 1 loser in each suit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv:  declarer will get home on a non @d lead or @d shift after winning @HA|pg||
nt|panja: hi, brilliant play by Laltu in CR..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: @HQ lead to @HA..and Club back...@SAK and @S to Q..and @D back....and then Laltu ran some trumps stripping E and exited with a @D|pg||
nt|rv:  defense was soft in CR|pg||
nt|panja: @DK shift after @SQ would have defeated...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|rv:  I fancy Manas-Banerje to beat thi|pg||
nt|rv:  to beat this here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: basically defense has to counter the threat of rounded suits squeeze on E|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: not easy....much needs to be done..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|panja: there is a @H @C squeeze on E, too|pg||

nt|rv:  Hi PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi rv|pg||
nt|rv:  yes sry didn't realise Manas has both @h honors, declarer is favorite to succeed|pg||
nt|psridhar: laltu of course wd hv done well to spurn the trump finesse, defense would not have had a sporting chance|pg||
nt|psridhar: for eg now the defense at this table has no chance|pg||
nt|rv:  now hand plays itself, Sandeep should get it right w/o too much difficulty|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: ty  PS for joining in here:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: at other tbl they got to shift to @c and E won his trump queen at a time when his pd had a trump to ruff @c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panja: Manas should continue @D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: Sandeep now has to guess @C...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|panja: quite likely..he will play for 22|pg||
nt|rv:  yes if Banerjee had one of @hQ or @HJ, this contract would have no chance |pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|psridhar: it will become "2-2" by the time trumps have been played|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: should x here I feel - the entire South bid has been singlehanded without any help from his ptr|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: you have to practice dutch before you come to veldhoven :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|dslee: for those who are unawere, NS is a father - son combination|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: maybe, they will understand some English down there as well...|pg||
nt|roswolf: but being charming hosts you all speak english:)|pg||
nt|dslee: with South Hand, I would had preferred to pass - the @H A is a bad card expecially when North bid 3@S only|pg||
nt|dslee: N did not show any extras|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: true :)|pg||

nt|josj: it's called "Nederengels"|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rv:  much better than Roland slam here for N-S:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: they were not tested RV-the @d lead helped|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: rather they were not given the sporting chance given to defense at other tbl|pg||
nt|rv:  this is coffee deal here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: if, say , sandeep ducked the @d lead, and W shifted to his stiff,,,,,declarer may hv finessed trumps and Manas wd hv been tested for the @c queen shift|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rv:  from bidding theory perspective, I like to play direct splinters on std 1M opening to be a bit weaker (10-12 hcp)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry-last deal , there is no story after the @d lead |pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv:  with 13+, 4 trumps with stiff, I prefer to go via jacoby or 2/1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bidding theory. I like differentiate between a singleton and a void and let 4x be void and 3NT an unspecified singleton (4@C asks where if interested)|pg||

nt|roswolf: maybe some action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: expect South to open 1@D|pg||
nt|dslee: game for NS - choices of 3NT, 4@H - would prefer the latter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back Mohit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: didn't he loose 2@D 1@S 1@C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: west should be counting and re-counting now - what to bid !|pg||
nt|dslee: ideally I would still overcall 2@C and wait to see where it goes|pg||
nt|psridhar: this might well end the auction|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and CK|pg||

nt|dimi: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have passed 2nt as east did in the other room|pg||
nt|josj: I think he did|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: S should respect the x even with defensive cards, with a balanced hand|pg||

nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunate choice by Souren Dutta, this will likely increase the lead|pg||

pc|sT|nt|bobholl: on a trump lead migth make :)|pg||
nt|dslee: trying to knock out the only dummy entry - W had to run after @C with @D intact, @S was not the best move since he has a singleton and cant play it once more|pg||

nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: Kushari had plenty of info for that shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: he knew about 6-4 shape in W|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing about all this shenanigans is that this will make the match tighter|pg||
pc|c2|nt|josj: this will shorten declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: should be 3 down |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: He knew abt AQ of @c with declarer|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer's @s therefore must be a broken suit as with KQJto 6 @s and AQ of @c he wont wjo|pg||
nt|psridhar: so no hurry for the @c ruff|pg||
nt|mohitz:  true|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Ace of spade is kinda marked with North, so this will be -1|pg||
nt|psridhar: still one needs to draw these inferences and act properly at the tbl|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i have a lot of sympathy with 3nt here|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure what NS plays , looks like precision or some form of strong @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Mostly a partials hand - unless NS is too ambitious to reach a @H game which can be taken down in a good EW def|pg||
nt|psridhar: admittedly kushari might have held @d jack and @s ace wd give only 15 to South|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 sry|pg||
nt|psyck: strong @c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dslee: No, sorry, think 4@H would always make|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: x is 5-7|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT shows an obvious @C join|pg||
nt|dslee: x from south - 2@C by Animesh and so on i guess from here?|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry 2@S by animesh- apologies for typo|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Jack of club was known, PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally 1N is passed with balanced 8 hcp -but 2Aces is different|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS might do well to stay out of this, though.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobholl: which they will bid now :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  choice of minors from Animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: this cannot be a choice of minors :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess if responder has 4M, he could try |pg||
nt|psridhar: true yes he didnt open 1N so king of @s was an error costing 2 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: i guess x was some single suiter, N would have done well to pass|pg||
nt|oliverc: Pass should be automatic by East, I feel|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: until told "officially" we have to accept what we are told|pg||
nt|dslee: i was been told by a kib that NS plays toad @C, not sure of this system|pg||
nt|dslee: he does not have support in @C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, he has a doubleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW now in a world of hurt. East couldn't care less if South has Diamonds as West|pg||
nt|oliverc: still able to protect|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  partner showed 6 odd clubs |pg||
nt|dslee: unless there is a specific understanding that the @C suit would be a quality one|pg||
nt|mohitz:  (presumably)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh well|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: my 3@C would be all my points in @C with a one hole suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv invited there -not passed 1N|pg||

nt|mohitz:  looks like a misunderstanding on the meaning of 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mohit|pg||
nt|dslee: crack from banerjee asking for @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: this is fine for EW, other room may start with 1@h-1@h & go on...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: Hi mohit|pg||

nt|dslee: undo?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to Srini, who is familiar with the N-S methods|pg||

pc|c3|nt|strike12: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dslee: hi srini- can you explaing the toad @c system?|pg||
nt|dslee: I am sure Manas would have a word or two with amarnath after this hand :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing cricket one becomes accustomed to it:):(|pg||
nt|bobholl: if P has only 4@C @D necessary so seen good :)|pg||
nt|josj: they have replays nowadays :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mohitz:  rehi|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but not easy for E to keep quiet at 1 level even if pd showed zilch|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: But as I said before, If South had Diamonds (and would pass North's 1@D bid)|pg||
nt|oliverc: West still has a bid if he has something|pg||
pc|sT|nt|josj: to overrule the umpires' clear views|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in 5@DXX, Animesh might have finessed diamond queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for -2|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psridhar: still only 8 tricks on @s hook failing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mohitz:  this wll be a quick claim|pg||
nt|strike12: it is basically a relay based strong club system, |pg||
nt|dslee: but how they dint reach this game or pass in 2@C with a @C lead?|pg||
nt|dslee: i mean 2@C x?|pg||
nt|strike12: X by N showed 5-7 so S shd bid game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: unless India are involved:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bobholl: TV cameras in cricket nowadays ?|pg||
nt|psyck: E was likely expecting S to bid 1@s on 1@d on which he would be stuck if does not bid immed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mohitz:  i guess North showed his hand yes|pg||
nt|strike12: 2c X is 19+|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: communications for declarer are very bad on this hand|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|nt|mohitz:  laltu bid 5@H too in bd 15|pg||

nt|dslee: i dont know his father but I know animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|strike12: yes should be flat board|pg||
nt|dslee: for all the kibbers, Mohit is one of the very promising indian youngstars from Bangalore|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H or 2@S from EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: OR may climb to 2N and if he misguesses @d queen , can be down a bunch|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i dont think you can stop in 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: or in 4@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if inviting, North will accept surely|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D might be opened too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: last hand , would had preferred a 2@S from Manas probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@H all pass probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  colors not right for North to enter the auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: if a purist 1@d opening then it can get to 2N |pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  3@C is just down 1 though|pg||
nt|psyck: ...after starting with 1@c prec last deal|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: 4@H looks straightforward|pg||
nt|mohitz:  tx Deb|pg||
nt|dslee: u wlc M|pg||
nt|strike12: X by S is @d|pg||
nt|dslee: cant contest I guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1@d-1n-2n all pass|pg||
mb|1S|nt|strike12: 2c is trs|pg||
nt|mohitz:  So, EW play precision too |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: with min 5 @d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW can make upto 3@H on correct guesses|pg||
nt|psridhar: precn will get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: interesting choice of 1N here|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N is generally played as 15-18, but with that solid @h, had other options|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mohitz:  if opening 1@D, East will probably overcall |pg||
nt|psyck: i thought either 1N or 1@c would get to game, surprisingly both didn't :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and that might affect the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but +1 ??|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm, i seen this lot of people playing 1@C-2@C as @D transfer - now it has got rare|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is fine too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mohitz:  not sure why East didnt bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, Animesh isn't the one to go down peacefully! |pg||
nt|mohitz:  anyway, another 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar: tightens the match good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mohitz:  PS, what defense do you play after this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  1@C prec followed by 1N rebid that is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dslee: why not a simple 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|strike12: i like 2nt with @d stuff|pg||
nt|dslee: i would hate to hide my master suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: same as 1N opg|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mohitz:  defenders have to establish a heart trick|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that seems convenient but i am convinced its right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mohitz:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  because presumably with both majors etc, we would have entered over 1@D itself?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *not|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the context of no bidding in the earlier round|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mohitz:  no, but say you play 1@C - p - 1@D - X as both majors|pg||
nt|psridhar: pass and bid in immd position -south here- i play as strong ; in North it is balancing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dslee: no quesitons asked :)|pg||
nt|dslee: best thing to do is play @D|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@D looks like -1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dslee: after cashing the @C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, make now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: @S @C squeeze possible if @S ruffed and no @C back ty kibs :)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mohitz:  heart shift best|pg||
nt|mohitz:  will declarer lose control?|pg||

nt|dslee: not showing extras|pg||

nt|vugraphzvz: SRY POWER FAILURE, LOST THE GAME ON BD.4|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: yes, pretty straightforward (3NT too)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dslee: does EW play tartan?|pg||
nt|strike12: looks like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not so much fun when we dont have the convention cards |pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh dear, East has revoked while defending 5@H |pg||
nt|mohitz:  in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: precision style, short @d's|pg||
nt|dimi: true|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: can south pass on this?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would a clear maximum even :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or double - tough choice imo|pg||
nt|psyck: played by E, an o/t in 5@c on @hK lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|strike12: this will be costly|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT here shows min @H support 3@C is pass or correct to 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mohitz:  i like 2@S by West here opposite a passed hand, gives them more trouble :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: another possiblity :)|pg||
nt|strike12: good X by N|pg||
nt|dslee: obvious one |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, the lead extends for railways|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: when do they open 1@D? this was a @D opening ideally playing the strong @C system - 1NT open would had been a little ambitious though|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for example, here is West bids 2@S, North must bid 2N which might be a level high|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *if|pg||
nt|psyck: W's @dK could well be a major K, so E will explore|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzvz: MOUSE PROBLEM SRY|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if n/s play precision 1@D MIGHT BE 0+|pg||
nt|josj: 1@H we had not thought of but it solves the problem to perfection|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dslee: -1 or -2 depending on def and play - this x by N is penalty? I guess no|pg||
nt|psridhar: north has played this game b4 and pass 2@s like he did in Bd no 30|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay, but that might be wrong on days|pg||
nt|psridhar: on more days your 2@S will be taken to the cleaners|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@c setting suit & gf in this seq|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: they do|pg||
nt|mohitz:  East wont like the dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: @d short already known, so the cue should be an honor|pg||
nt|psyck: which is not particularly good news for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YES THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE OFTEN HAVE THE BEST POINT OF VIEW|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D passed out scores best :)|pg||
nt|dslee: yah, often we dont like our dummies - seldom we do :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  he wanted to get his spade suit in|pg||
nt|mohitz:  also preempts 1@H overcalls|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not a bad strategy in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|mohitz:  i actually don't think there is a lot of risk of being taken to the cleaners if partner knows our style|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner may have no role to play |pg||
nt|mohitz:  true i agree sometimes it might go pass pass X etc|pg||
nt|psyck: no more poorly than the 3N in other room|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but in my (limited) experience it works out quite well|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mohitz:  how did you figure -1?|pg||
nt|strike12: @d shift now|pg||
nt|dslee: lets see - if its a penalty, E has a lot of clues now|pg||
nt|dslee: I bet the move will be @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: so another push|pg||
nt|psyck: that was poorly judged|pg||
nt|psyck: with no major cue, maybe W should not bid 4N, in any case E needs too much from pd for slam after 4@d bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes. If West not encouraged by the @H cue and can't show the Spade king, East|pg||
nt|oliverc: should subside in 5@C|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@c played by E after the lead of @h K would be on ... all other leads and position is down one|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h was rkc i'm told|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, no chance played by West|pg||
nt|psyck: but looking at 4N response, maybe they were not on the same page|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: now not a push jos :)|pg||
nt|josj: i c   :(|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: but I can't believe it|pg||
nt|psridhar: why did he overtake? declarer cant hv 5 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: nv, decent suit, some shape, i've no gr8 objection to 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: having overtaken he might well hv shifted to @s|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently 4nt was explained by Samant to Souren as 2 key cards + trump Q|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dslee: lol|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|psyck: we really don't want to know what their bidding meant anyway :)|pg||

nt|strike12: .|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing standard, the auction might go 1N all pass|pg||
nt|drkvas:  3nt seems to be the favorite destination|pg||
nt|mohitz:  they will open 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, both the sides plays strong @C|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i mead on many deals like 3 4 2 9 etc|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure if they top it by 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|drkvas:  did not q|pg||

nt|mohitz:  the other table, kaustubh did bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Dipak doubled which seems like a mistake|pg||
nt|psyck: N did not have any good choice on 2@s |pg||
nt|psridhar: he had a GOOD choice alright -pass ; but he needed to think of it|pg||

nt|psyck: other table would not expect any big scores so far, but EW here know they are down now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: transfer?|pg||
nt|strike12: will u bid 1nt  frm N?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  can make 4@S |pg||
nt|mohitz:  but will play a spade partial|pg||
pc|s7|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i feel if ur playing strong @c 15 17 nt makes no sense|pg||
nt|dslee: Raj 1 has to pull up in next 10, this I guess is gone for them|pg||
nt|drkvas:  u can play 14 15 if u like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  putting up all nt ranges in 1@C hurts during competition|pg||
nt|dslee: no 1NT here from E?|pg||
nt|dslee: N for his pass is assumed to hold a @H length and @S short|pg||
nt|psridhar: there are other objectives to bidding than just give your lho a problem|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: 3nt by N is best but difficult to reach now ...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n frivilous interference hurts too|pg||
nt|strike12: 1@h is specifically 4 @s so E might wait and watch here|pg||
nt|dslee: since 1@S is opened , they can take off to 4 now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: this looks an inevitable 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: W comes to rescue|pg||
nt|strike12: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: S has the values for at least one raise now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@S opening is systemic|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will invite|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and North will reject i guess|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mohitz:  better play not play in NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: maybe N is considering a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a push too time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|josj: remote...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, east opened 1N all pass|pg||
nt|dslee: would had bid 3@S here if at all|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in NT, defenders can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dslee: not the most obvious lead from W|pg||
pc|d8|nt|drkvas:  i think rajasthans team is an adhoc 1|pg||
nt|mohitz:  opposite a PH, that has to be one of the primary objectives imo|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway i dont endorse 2@s and not interested in discussing its merits /demerits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mohitz:  South might bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  fair enough|pg||

nt|mohitz:  well, it depends on agreements|pg||
nt|dslee: mostly no in this system|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this match will likely meet Railways in the finals tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  pass, 2@D and or even 2@H makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dslee: desperate - choose your best 3 card|pg||
nt|dslee: thats what 2@D would had been|pg||
nt|dslee: some agreements play as 5 4 4 and @D can be passed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: Railways was leading by 117 before this set|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: Bihar may have conceded by now :)|pg||
nt|psyck: but they chose to play this set|pg||
pc|d5|nt|josj: but a likely push again, simply too difficult|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@C was artificial 16+|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D negative|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South is just bidding his shape|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: Mohit, I will be right back - may be 10 mins or so|pg||

pc|d6|nt|psyck: a strange auction, W had no bid on 2@d opp a weak NT|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c was presumably for majors|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|nt|roswolf: just shows you what possibilities exist|pg||
nt|josj: that's why it's such a nice game|pg||
nt|josj: what is happening? players left the table temporarily? general meltdown?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i play 2nt and 3@C as answer on stayman for 5@H and 5@S respectively why don't moere people play it that way (no disadvantage i see)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i dont understand the 4@S bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dslee: ok - good moves till now all over|pg||
nt|dslee: play back the @S animesh|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

nt|mohitz:  i assume bd 6 is not at the table yet |pg||
nt|strike12: 2h opening byN|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing more than 2@S or 3@H partials|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is a stretch to say the least|pg||
nt|dslee: and fron the wrong hand too|pg||
nt|mohitz:  another partial|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will likely open a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the bad spade break means that even 3@S is in trouble|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2N can be defeated on good defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so Kepri just recorded the biggest swing of the match so far, no less than 4 imps|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if playing in game, i would want to be in 4@H |pg||
mb|1C|nt|drkvas:  now tough to find their @s fit |pg||

nt|mohitz:  3@H i guess|pg||
nt|mohitz:  11 imps for the needy as expected|pg||

nt|strike12: S may try a game|pg||
nt|dslee: No :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  interesting|pg||
nt|mohitz:  X likely to be penalty here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: X now 3@C 3nt push :)|pg||
nt|dslee: only penalty|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing else|pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: maybe 2nt leb|pg||

nt|strike12: yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: lebensohl?|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|mohitz:  looks like they play weak NT even in this position|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes now difficult to reach 2nt in W :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: penalty axe!?|pg||
nt|josj: just -1...|pg||
nt|josj: but better than -200|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is hands off penalty after a leb 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a swing of 250 anyway :)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|josj: they get bigger and bigger|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i was under the impression it was only when NV|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dimi: sorry i have to leave|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mohitz:  so, NS will get a heart, 2 clubs and two diamond tricks eventually for -1|pg||

nt|dslee: Dr, this was a sitting duck to crack |pg||

nt|drkvas:  not so clear cut des|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so 6 more to Kepri|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: probably...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  I would have bid 3@H |pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: with a 21hcp count i hate not doubling these contracts|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rv:  Manas should get home here especially on this lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv:  a black suit lead might have given more problems, still declarer was favorite|pg||
nt|rv:  declarer can play @d to J, subsequently one @h ruff enough|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|rv:  even 11 tricks possible now|pg||
nt|rv:  Sandeep Karmarkar works for HPCL (Hindusthan Petroleum), Anal Shah works for travel company owned by his friend and great billiards player Geet Sehi|pg||
nt|rv:  Sethi|pg||
nt|rv:  Manas, Amarnath and rest of IR team work for Indian public sector behemoth, Indian Railways|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: will post the result|pg||
nt|rv:  we lost connection, back on|pg||
nt|rv:  thanks Buddy, I suspect 11 tricks for Manas|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: play still ON|pg||
nt|rv:  10 tricks are straightforward, he could make 11 if he wants to w/o too much risk|pg||
nt|rv:  as said earlier, black suit lead would have given declarer stiffer test|pg||

nt|oliverc: slamming here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: Strong club may get them to the cold 7@D|pg||
nt|psyck: other room, after no @d cue by S, was easy to stop in 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rv: lead now 55 IMPs for IR, fairly sizeable though we have 2 more segments to play|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rv: yes strong @c systems facilitate bidding these hands where one hand is very strong, std 2@c does pre-empt auction|pg||
mb|3S|nt|josj: E will be shown up...|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you finesse @H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: less room after opening 2@c in std|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: naturally:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even with diamonds 4-0 you want to be in the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: It makes it complicated, but still with chances|pg||
nt|rv: I presume2@c by North is conventional showing bal hand 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: true show up squeeze also works :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I don't know what 3NT is. I would have bid 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|josj: with the D!A Vienna Coup the squeeze would even work against W too :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might easily get to the slam level but choose to play in @C|pg||
nt|josj: @DA|pg||
nt|josj: should be np either if plyed as nt|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
nt|rv: I would have passed with North instead of bidding 3n, if South had redoubled showing first round control, then 3@s would have been perfect|pg||
nt|mohitz:  these guys play a relay based system |pg||
nt|psyck: similar here too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: or passing even as rv suggests|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@H was likely a relay asking shape|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: which is a better contract (32 @C is sufficient)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: I THINK THE OTHER ROOM SCORE IS WRONG|pg||
nt|josj: and if 4-1 play it as 6nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely geoffry :)|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mohit fine|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says 4nt by SOUTH made 10 tricks:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Jos and Bob for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this could be another swing for IR if Manas-Amarnath get to 3n instead of 4@s in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|josj: another slam and once again not such  good one, worse than the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pulling 3NT seems strange. He did bid his spades three times before that|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: yes Roland|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: And he has excellent cards for notrump after that|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: yes @DQ is a gold card and 2 outside kings|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: blank honour works either way provided you guess correctly which way :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might be bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzjb: for result : http://halamanbridge.org/batam/|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will soon see|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Manas's 3@d here would be NF, hence his decision to temporise with 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to tje|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry|pg||
nt|rv: Banerjee could have rebid his @s suit once more instead of slightly contrived 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to the king, @DQ, king ace, club to dummy, @D9|pg||
