nt|athene: a spec suggests the double might be a game-try - yes, in other situations you might double 3@H to say you have a game invitation in spades, but not here, having passed 2@S already|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: the spec is confused ... double would be a game try if East had bid 3@H over 2@S, clearly not here|pg||
nt|pelu: so the X here: partner, what do u like: pass or bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right ... a wonderful blame transfer bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: that is what most doubles say these days :) another way to put it: partner, if this goes wrong it's your fault|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|murat e: that is correc if there is no space left for a try bid double serves for that purpose -not the case here-|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: it's ok if you discuss exactly how much defence you show, so partner knows when to pass it and when to bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems to me from the first three boards that when Imagination was being handed out , South got in line twice|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west perhaps intended 3@D as forcing|pg||
nt|athene: not a sequence that most pairs will have discussed, i imagine|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Here, South's imaginative bidding has opened a crack in the E/W agreements|pg||
nt|pelu: for me forcing - X of 1Nt and bid|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think the 1NT overcall is hugely off-centre|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think you are right ... once West doubled 1NT, his 3@D bid cannot be dropped|pg||
nt|athene: he sort of has sort of a balanced 15-18|pg||
nt|athene: with a spade stop :)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt-then-3@C shows his hand prety well|pg||
nt|athene: pretty well even|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|murat e: wests 3 dia doubtful because partner may pass this which he did|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: I like all the bidding ontil the pass from East :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: if west were sure that 2@H guaranteed five, his life would be easier|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that is obvious|pg||
nt|athene: might you not pull the double to 2@H with a very weak 6-4?|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant - 2@H just a weak opening with both majors|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: say the same hand just without the fifth heart|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: , but when weak then often 5-5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: maybe with that hand east should pull the double to *three* hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: saying "i have weak hcp but lots of playing strength"|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: that might just go very wrong if the hand is a big misfit, though|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||

nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I agree and learnt at very late stage:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the count in the @C immediately known after trick one|pg||

nt|sybarra: 0708 in Washington DC |pg||
nt|riccho:  hi shirley :) |pg||
nt|leao:  i like 5@h|pg||

nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||

nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 1@c be the opening then? |pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
nt|daman: he can claim 7|pg||
nt|figo: though with entries in W hand , S x was also ok|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko ¿e teraz mo¿e powstaæ poszum...na szczêcie nie|pg||

nt|bobholl: 23 of @H are too low :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and maybe the coaches have talked about "wildness" |pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: S would be careful in discards to save the @S.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|leao:  difficult for him to conduct the auction... pard mite have had a pressure bid|pg||

pc|h7|pc|s2|nt|frankbo: trange way to play|pg||

nt|frankbo: strange|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: looks like he is home now |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Textbook stuff|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 1nt :) but i don't think it makes much difference, most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: your bid, your system - but not my style|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has 8 tricks on top|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and a ninth in spades, no sweat once @S8 drops|pg||
nt|murat e: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the risk is that the defence can take 5 tricks first ... 3 in diamonds and 2 in spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So declarer has an alternative option, which is to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the @Ds - big problem from Ss chair|pg||
nt|murat e: they cant east can play dia only once|pg||
nt|pelu: he could easy lose 2@ss and 3@ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My inclination would be to play a spade back anyway |pg||
nt|pelu: sorry, N declarer, but same problem|pg||
nt|pelu: as u se - but N cantm there are not 3@D tricks for EW|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: yes but at trick 1 that might have been one issue|pg||
nt|murat e: norths dia 8 is higher than easts 7 so will not rise w the king ý guess|pg||
nt|athene: north is worried that east has something nasty to lead in diamonds, like @DJx|pg||
nt|athene: especially if the @C2 asked for diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That's that|pg||
nt|pelu: could still make if discard a @S, but playing for @DA in E|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: to be fair, his diamond spots are so bad, that most of time the defence WILL have three diamonds to take, when west has encouraged the suit|pg||

nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  hmm South a little passive in my opinion|pg||
nt|chrisky: x or 2nt prommising the minors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: they bid Norths suit,  this isnt easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1NT maybe ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: does 2 nt promise minors? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: over @C+@D nat by opps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 nt is option is if coming in |pg||
nt|rnmalik: x here would bring in @S:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south realise that north not so serious -he did|pg||
nt|riccho:  as I said before, difficult to defend this blast into 3NT bidding sequences|pg||
nt|leao:  lets hope they bid this one|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3N na razie oczywiste chyba|pg||
nt|figo: hence this forced solution ..............like this 3H bid|pg||
nt|MBV53: two infractions in one deal!!!:)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Seems as someting can be of here,|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  passing twice is very passive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and west should at least explore that possibility|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s makeable but need deep finess in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky the ace of clubs in S |pg||
nt|riccho:  @d5 is a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th best |pg||
nt|jkotor: very nice Wojtek na N, przewartociowa³ piki partnera i kiery E|pg||
nt|antoniz: As kier by nie traciæ tempa|pg||

nt|leao:  4@h now|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  No |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and why not?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @s K and a weak suit|pg||

pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: ie. bid 3nt over 3@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: he was hesitating between 5 and 10@D |pg||
nt|figo: opps Hs very well placed for E here|pg||

nt|bebechira: Eyal Erez in 4s in the open room|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  this one may be less successful|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In first position its more temptating|pg||

nt|antoniz: logiczny pas|pg||
nt|serhat: dbled?|pg||

nt|bebechira: indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: nice result for israel in other room|pg||
nt|bebechira: they defeated 3h... so no chance for a significant swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in OR  west underled the ace of @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: EW need to shift in @C quickly to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: can only be profitable for israel|pg||
pc|hA|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to lose 2H unless play 9|pg||
nt|leao:  that lead must have pinpointed the @s Q|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pinticus: ok now score is ok|pg||
nt|jkotor: N potrzebuje w zasadzie atutów, ale poszed³ "automatyczny" splinter|pg||
nt|serhat: huge defense mistake I belive|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Top on a board is 50; the top 4 scores are within 10 matchpoints; 5th is 100 matchpoints behind|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still team. Do E hope for a slam? Bid 4 and fin.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but must say if leading @D I am leading the 10 or 9 (whatever our partnerships agee. is) |pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: 2 imps.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|raghavan: so 1 down|pg||

nt|runnerup: or perhaps little miastake in avblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: ye|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  strange to play E for long spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  I estimate 650 will be about 80%; -100 about 20. so an average round|pg||
nt|henryb:  No scores being posted for this round for some reason|pg||
nt|psyck: scores are coming in ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  they are now. 3N has 4@s, 2@d and 2@h. It is in fact likely to make|pg||
nt|henryb:  although DF would not say that it would|pg||
nt|psyck: Your estimates were close enough, so we didn't need the scores anyway :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: trumps *|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: i suppose you want to play this in 6@D or 6NT from east - that's a bit of a tall order :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|murat e: 6 spades makes or not here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3N|nt|athene: 6nt by east is 100% isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but now W has @Ds and NT, so..|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat e: no good|pg||
nt|pelu: good shot - 5@D dont make on a @H-lead :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So this requires a heart lead to break it ... and that's not that easy a lead to find|pg||
nt|athene: north won't lead singleton against slam with an ace in his hand, will he?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wouldn't think so|pg||
nt|murat e: but norths heart is singleton....|pg||
nt|athene: the only time it's right is when it kills a vital entry or something :) he has to imagine the whole layout really|pg||
nt|pelu: buit no future in a @C-lead|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it is not impossible|pg||
nt|pelu: @SA and @H will also work|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A heart lead could pickle the suit ... I don't think it's likely|pg||
nt|athene: take the entry out of dummy for the spade suit|pg||
nt|murat e: however heart lead kills entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding has sort of suggested how a heart lead might work|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North would have to be a little clairvoyant to pick the situation|pg||
nt|pelu: @H lead - any bets?|pg||
nt|pfbr: 60%|pg||
nt|athene: well, you must suspect one opponent or other to have a singleton club|pg||
nt|murat e: too much depends on the lead here.....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'll stick with "not likely"|pg||
nt|pfbr: likely :)|pg||
nt|athene: come on, north!|pg||
nt|pelu: chikens - no bet - just a coke ?:)|pg||
nt|pfbr: i'm on |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: if we told him "Only one card in your hand beats this slam" he still wouldn't know|pg||
nt|pfbr: AH|pg||
nt|athene: might be @SA was needed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pfbr: i owe u a coke :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's another point on this opening lead decision|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: a coke for u Dunno :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West started with 3NT, happy to play there, and all of a sudden bid 6@D when East bid hearts|pg||
nt|pfbr: no i thought he'd lead it :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|bjacobs: Somehow, the heart bid encouraged him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would tend to suggest that you should stay away from the suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In my opinion, West's bidding was very inconsistent, but he'll take the 13 imps|pg||
nt|athene: well if the hearts and diamonds are solid you should lead the @SA?|pg||
nt|murat e: other room stopped in 5 dia|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has a heart trick and declarer needs hearts as a trick source, he is down, unless he has a spade void|pg||
nt|athene: dunno, it seems a bit difficult|pg||
nt|pelu: against 5@D a @H-lead looks very normal - NS need 3 tricks, so credit to W for his 6@D|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||

mb|4S|nt|athene: he was happy to defend 4@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Clearly, a double of 4@H would be a ridiculous bid|pg||

nt|pfbr: coz if he didnt isn't it down anyway?|pg||

nt|athene: should 5 of a minor now be a void or his second suit?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: should be a cue|pg||
nt|athene: yes but partner would want to know what sort of cue|pg||
nt|murat e: vürtually slam from south has no problems with the heart king rightly placed|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. if he has KJx in it, and xxx in the other minor, is that good or bad?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: so now look at it from south's point of view - if north is just cueing a void, he has diamonds, and south has the world|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North is going to have to do this all himself - he's the one who controls hearts|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: but if 5@C says i have clubs, south's hand is not so great|pg||
nt|pelu: now S with all the @Ss has to bid 6@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe this auction is quite clever|pg||
nt|athene: maybe|pg||
nt|murat e: maybe not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, maybe or maybe not, but at some point he had to get a 5@H bid in, and he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Alternatively, he can do what North did at the other table ... make a commitment himself|pg||
nt|murat e: it seems north has a void in diamonds and south hate it difficult decision....|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if Aluf dont bid 6! now I would ask him to send his wife to the tables for next segment :):)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Certainly his spades are gold ... but the rest of the hand is dross|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But his partner made two slam tries without @SKQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||

nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||

nt|sybarra: what I told, the 3 @S showed wk spades,  but my question is why not support hts? |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: I hope he didnt think a)  3 sp forcing or b) pard could read his mind re 4 @H in his hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||

nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
nt|tlc: making 5 with any normal line of p[lay|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
nt|veistikke:  got a feeling of 3!nt inn S|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale 1@d wykluczam, tam jest mo¿e 8-9 PC|pg||
nt|serhat: N should bid definately last hand. dbl or 4h both fine for me as he has D tolerans|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
nt|jkotor: a co s¹dzimy o Pasie?|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||

nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||

nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||

nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||

nt|sybarra: @H lead in the OR |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next please :)|pg||
nt|tlc: dont you wish someone could just tell declarer that :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland is not getting too much cricket.. bad weather in London|pg||

pc|s7|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
