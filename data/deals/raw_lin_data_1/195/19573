nt|doks: Hi all, wellcome back to Jurmala, Teams tournament finals Latvia-Finland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|doks: NS from Latvia playing strong club|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: balance or no balance ---no need|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 3@S if they guess everything|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: The defense has trick in each suit and possibly another in spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: no chance here atleast after this lead|pg||
nt|psyck: will make 2 in practice|pg||
nt|doks: team Latvia win semifinall vs Lithuania/Nederlands team with 12 IMP margin, Team Finland wins very convincingly|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psyck: it was a very aggresive try esp for an NV game|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause after @d lead there could have been some littel hope|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|bagman: Veksa starting to set up the side suit; a sound priciple with a two suiter and so-so trump suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|runnerup: but very stange to ruff partners winner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bagman: Patana GranstrÃ¶m play 3rd/5th leads; by leading the 9 and following with the 10, E showed one more high card -> Patana should not have ruffed (on the other hand, E could have ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played the @CQ)|pg||

nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
pc|d4|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|runnerup: ok|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|1C|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|1N|an|moth majors or both minors|mb|p|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
mb|2D|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: but perhaps he heart me say 8 insteadt of 7|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+C|nt|doks: 1@C 2+ as I remember correctly|pg||
nt|bagman: EW open 1@C even with 3-3-5-2 if outside their NT range|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|doks: no flat 4333 boards here, only swing boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 1@H transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|runnerup: now easyer for ew to come to @s than after some jump in @d ,but north was too strong|pg||
nt|bagman: S wants to pass|pg||
mb|4C|nt|runnerup: and overbid by ns again 3. in a row|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bagman: Is S allowed to pass now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|runnerup: like they bid -some breaks needed|pg||

nt|bagman: he took some time to work that out|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: happy to get an entry, but either side suits needs to be played twice towards to set up extra trick|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|zebutin: this semifinal seem to be all latvian players, so other semifinal is all finnish players, so happily atleast 1 finnish team in finals...|pg||
nt|psyck: AUNI from Latvia and Shadyro from Lithuania/Netherlands|pg||
nt|zebutin: colin brown is playing in shadyro team, that doesn't sound like latvian name though...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: when looking at results... to find a player quickly... do CTRL/F and a small window will allow you to type in the name you're looking for... the name is then highlighted|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: Koistinen-Nyberg playing magic diamond (strong @D system with weak openings) so there will be difference on bidding of most of boards|pg||

nt|zebutin: N/S have won several finnish teams&pairs championships, and have represented Finland several times|pg||

pc|dA|nt|zebutin: good lead for defence, even though bidding sequence might imply that jansons has @S suit|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: there seem to be 10 tricks in a @c contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: and EW play natural|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: 11th will come with fav @s's & @c 22|pg||
nt|zebutin: @H lead makes N sweat, but when @H Q gets the 1st trick|pg||
nt|zebutin: its looking little better|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: bad contract should be down but some defence needed|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely then playing @D to K|pg||
nt|zebutin: or maybe finese...|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that has still chances in @S + @C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|wiki: somebody in NSwas lazy|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is enough @s lead and no chance to make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zebutin: might try to go after @H suit too, atleast with this development|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: that shift will speedup play|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|zebutin: maybe jansons was thinking declarer having something like Axxx, 10x, xxx, Axxx or something on those lines, without @S return opponents can just give @H out and claim rest...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|zebutin: ofc that is only 8 point opening...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wiki: N promised a very good hand / maybe S should have bid once more / not easy|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|runnerup: dont ew know to take 1, @h strange|pg||
nt|zebutin: so declarer either has @H K or @S K on top of those atleast, if @H K seems quite hopeless, if @S K @D continuation might seem better...|pg||
nt|psyck: http://www.rigainvites.com/|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|santyclz: Oh my!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|zebutin: so now needs to play for 4-4 @H or @S+@C behaving nicely (or no entry in @D to long @H)|pg||
mc|10|nt|zebutin: so had some different variations, but everything would have worked this time...|pg||
