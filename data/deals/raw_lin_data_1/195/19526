nt|sveing: Hi all:) this is the final round of this session (round 4) 7 boards|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should be on their way to slam now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver|pg||
nt|april7: actually , after @D and @D ruff W should give up a @H as long he has ace of @S and making m5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both west supported on a good doubleton. Key bid to reach the heart game|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H*|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, easts :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Oliver|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N a bit too optomistic of N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Overnight leaders are E-W|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The so-called naturalists play a quite complexed system developed by Per Ongstad. He calls it Streamlined Culbertson|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: ew are warned now -can they make rigth decision now+|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  but can't blame him since S simply asked for a @h stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h a very marginal overbid, but you have four trumps |pg||
nt|april7: if N switches to @S, contract is down, but very difficult|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 9 of diamonds discourage. Suggests a shift|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 4@s explained as cuebid from N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Jim probably just wanted to show secondary support|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: W has then to cash Aand K of @H and play on @C,then also 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done champ!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: And we may expect some quite unusual auctions|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But Aalberg found another road|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Hei SG|pg||
nt|sveing: Hi Roland:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you shut out 2@s and 3@c from NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now, if North doesn't switch to a spade, this can make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: Yes. West might have struggled in 2@H, but little chance for Declarer now|pg||
nt|sveing: Tre knekter og ettS are leaders after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: More roads to one down here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smat move by Marstrander, but declarer did not fall for it, and should not|pg||
nt|april7: now AK of @H and then @C!!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphztc: Results at http://bridgefestival.no/results.htm|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Hilde|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be better than 3nt with @d out ,but still down because bad sits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smart even|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 8 tricks, I fear|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CK could have been onside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would still give West 12 hcp for his opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to find 3 pitches|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Welcome back to the Norwegian Swiss teams Penultimate round and Abax have been in the lead all day|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: South played @c7 then @c9 - if normal-style caridng, that should indicate someting in spades|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 5 clubs looks like a decent contract here. Can it be reached in the open room?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruff and discard rarely successful|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sverjohn: Lead was quite favourable for declarer. More trouble with the "normal" diamond lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sverjohn: Welcome to the last session of the Norwegian Swiss Teams Championships|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sverjohn: Some people play a direct jump to the 3-level as a singleton. Could be ideal here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: actully with small @d out -here it goes better ofcause|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sveing: sitting EW here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The so called garbage multi is popular among the younger players in Norway.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  that seemed pretty blunt|pg||
nt|april7: well done by W|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to John Eldar-Pedersen|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Must have pulled the wrong card|pg||
pc|cK|nt|runnerup: yes makeable now and good score if so|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A friend of mine says: As along as enough players at the table play the contract it will normally make :) True here. North joined in the declaring|pg||

nt|sverjohn: true|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: perhaps should have finessed other way -because then only 1 doen ,which is better than in 3nt (-2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in the slam zone|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphztc: updated results|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: another @H contract by EW, although losing at least 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Here we go with Streamline. 10-14 with 5 hearts I believe|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Great MP or BAM score :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be an important swing here. Trigger happy South in open room|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, 9-12|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|andersk: Might be case for playing @S Q, since South opened and N have @C A|pg||
nt|oliverc: just has to get the @S's right|pg||
nt|andyv:  now we will see how good a guesser N is|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Sandsmark: "What kind of blackwood do you use?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: pass?|pg||
nt|loe48: 3c is showing some cards now i assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|loe48: :)|pg||
nt|sveing: so here we go again|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: this is the last segment today. back tomorrow 10 AM local time|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Seems like declarer has two options for his 9th trick. Here both work|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Ovesen won yesterday's pairs championships|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sverjohn: Dangerous preference. North must suggest 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Assume 2 NT shows 3@H & max|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: club switch best but not enough|pg||
nt|sveing: easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: good position for NS, losing only at most 2 @S 1 @H and 1 @C|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sveing: not enough but if she use the Q?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: does not matter|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 3@S & max|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sveing: yor are right|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Cards lie well for declarer here. 12 tricks to be taken, but slam is not odds-on|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: She has a pitch on @DK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|runnerup: ligth takeout double and they found a game -now only to make /+1 -even perhaps|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Creative lead, but only overtricks the matter now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sverjohn: Hansen tried a "passive" lead. Did not work too well, but which lead would|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andersk: Even with @D K lead, u have nothin to discard @C on, so better find out where @C A is by playing @C|pg||
nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is that he will play E for J@s|pg||
nt|sveing: yepp|pg||
nt|sverjohn: To beat the contract, take your tricks and lock him in dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sverjohn: Should be able to beat this one now. Declarer can score 4 hearts and 3 clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|april7: ace of @S and @D Q|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sverjohn: nice duck|pg||
nt|sverjohn: small spade! :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like both 3 NT and 4@S on here - friendly lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pair Championship is a grueling event - approx 170 boards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sverjohn: Yes, these guys have been playing all week I believe|pg||
nt|sverjohn: North should know he was on a 5-2 fit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Best without Cards are doing quite well *with* cards it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: they are writing on the bridgemate, not thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR on board 2, N bid 2N (instead of dbl) and S bid 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Liv Marit, good morning to you|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liv|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: hi all :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Modern neg. double style. Denies 4 spades. Not suitable for 1 NT|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1 or 3 clubs, that's the question. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Bjørn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: S is Ekrens brother|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, this is Steinar Ekren I now see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Liv Marit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like need to find @SQ in 4@S unless pitch @D on 13th @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnp: Hi all, ready now|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Difficult hand to handle. Fyrun feels his hand too good to pass now partner having overcalled vuln. But what to bid?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
nt|sverjohn: When in doubt, bid 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: a slam coming up but good save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could very well reach the normally nice grand now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Another coffee hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England most would respond as East - 1NT most likely|pg||
nt|april7: could be pushed to 7!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: They violated Hamman's rule...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This can go astray now. Rekstad may have shown a better hand|pg||
nt|april7: another swing here if it makes or going down, one way or other|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Not enough tricks for NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphztc: 3@c shows A or K in @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  this should be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, the suit behaves so 4@s is safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure what he intended - only 13 HCP|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both sides overbidding here. Do not like Berset's 3 diamonds. What are his extras?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|johnp: Please adwise link for result and cam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps North might have tried 5@D en route - then South can take a swing at 5@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: He may have made it too difficult for himself - many would simply bid 3 NT over 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1@d probably denies 5c majors|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: always only 12 tricks!!but tempting to bid 7NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sverjohn: Lunna showed the Ace of hearts, but Andersbakk could only find 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Johansen in for a difficult task here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sverjohn: They probably dont play 2/1 GF Then 2NT would stand out a mile|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Lunna's pass showed hA|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But will maybe escape for 1 down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: no cam this year|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even though it might be an unsuccessful swing|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Karlsen - Thoresen missed the slam board 1. Makes the mixup even more expensive|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|sverjohn: Needs the spade K onside. Means both read kings probably in south's hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|penseur9: results at Results at http://bridgefestival.no/results.htm|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: South had to do that to keep an entry to dummy - wanted East to have single 10 or J |pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  3N has the plus of testing both @hs and @ds for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|sverjohn: good lead. Declarer can prevail by leading small heart twice|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|loe48: correct play is small play from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S is wash&go|pg||
nt|sverjohn: from dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sverjohn: Hansen knew from the bidding that his pd had at least 7 hearts|pg||
nt|april7: an unlucky deccision by S bidding 7, otherwise big swing for his team|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sverjohn: Not my choice of an opening bid, but worked well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: no chance now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|andyv:  probably 3N by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By North even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably on a D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: both ways should lead to 3nt as i assume 3c show some values|pg||
nt|oliverc: So Declarer got the Spades wrong on  9|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell whether lack of entries or E having only 1@h influenced N in the @s suit.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I have visitors and have to go. Thanks everyone. Enjoy the rest of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: he played spade to the queen and then the 9 to W jack|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: on board 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I get a 10% bonus every time I mention wash&go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: head&shoulders only offered 7%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4033  Siv Thoresen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder why he played for the drop....|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So Abax takes the first 3 imps from the first hand. Expect these last two to be pushes|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|april7: 6@S going down on a @H lead, so NS should stay out ofcourse, let see if possible|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Stealing the opponents suit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: well, if you don't double something that makes from time to time you aren't doubling enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: has to find @s fit somehow here -to bid 6|pg||
nt|johnp: @s slam but how to get there?|pg||
nt|penseur9: or more :)|pg||
nt|loe48: if they use lebensohl|pg||
nt|sverjohn: If spade queen doesnt drop, there is a chanceof establishing a club trick to ditch a diamond|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be some fireworks here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This opening could very well lead to slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  might just bid 3N now|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't have enough hair to make that worthwhile :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Good sacrifice|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Takes a diamond lead to kill it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sverjohn: Looks like a pretty standard game hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: what will South do here - pass most likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 2NT to be forcing, or better play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and needs to guess @DQ, with not a lot to go on|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 5h is the limit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: I think 3@D is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would probably go down on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sverjohn: And good decision by Berset|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Trumps do not behave, but spades and diamonds are more friendly|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2Nt was maybe limited|pg||
nt|sverjohn: should be a comfortable make even if both major kings placed wrongly|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because both contracts depend on @DQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that they can't beat 3NT, unfair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, on the spade layout, this has chances |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|johnp: 2@d=GF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All too predictable|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Strange that Lunna didnt enter in this vuln. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|sverjohn: So, time for coffee|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1 @s denied 4-card majors,not suitable for a NT bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  a little bit of work...first tackle the easy suit..@hs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: south has some cards after north bids @s so slam found -guessed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody said life was fair |pg||
nt|april7: with a signletzon @H and a 5th @C slam would be on and S might have tried by bidding 5@S asking for second round control in @H, but iS is not strong anough|pg||
nt|sverjohn: clearly a case for not bidding here, but pd would bid 2h with much stronger cards|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|johnp: hm|pg||
nt|johnp: imo blind shot when bidding, but I am offside so...|pg||
nt|penseur9: will need to establish is @Ds first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 out of 2 right, time to retire|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Hard to blame North though, if he thought his partner's hand was relatively balanced   |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Open room copied the misdefence on hand 15|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: good lead|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So Ovesen refused to show his hearts settling for 2 diamons |pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  @s suit will be a pleasent suprise to declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: south must have been a little woryed of second round @h control ,but north had it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Less than 25%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the Discworld novels million-to-one chances come up nine times out of ten |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - these are 7 board matches so one hand can decide the entire match. Big lead to Abax now|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 3min break|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H opening by N and then....???let see what E does|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Lots of tricks, but how would hearts work E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2min break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: E-W needed that. Should have continued clubs to keep the spade trick away|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|johnp: Another national champ (N)...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done by E-W in the open. Karlsen knows his pd. could be very aggressive in these situations|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  NS might get to a pushy 3N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: May have given a few back on the last hand. Impossible to picture pd with a single heart I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW are placed 3rd after four matches; NS 11th|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: some very forward bidding next door|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  isnt multi showing 6@s 6@h or a strong hand?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andersk: top 8 ATM can win, I beleve 9th and further will be too far behind|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Further actions from N-S could be expensive|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: 2@D equal length in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sveing: but i think he will bid that|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Breaks not too good for E-W here|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Karlsen knows to switch to a diamond when in with @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to do so|pg||
nt|april7: should be|pg||
mb|4H|an|()|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@s?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Too little. Why not 2NT first round|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: very unilateral|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW did their job|pg||
nt|loe48: 1/4|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|loe48: and 6s|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|sveing: maybe better to use K of @S the first time.. then it could be a lead from AQJ|pg||

pc|h5|nt|april7: but on a finesse of 10 of @D for example saves also a trick!!!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes, think he would have got that right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am willing to risk that spades are not 7-0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East can afford it....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: 2min break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: What a result from the open room! North never bid his diamonds. But 6 clubs is on|pg||
nt|sharkey: East never supported @C...|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: one more match today|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: last board in this match, next match will begin 19.45|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So the match has a new leader|pg||
nt|sverjohn: There seems to have been a crash in the open room, but SHHG are in 4 hearts dbl. on  board 25 so big swings for Abax coming up|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Possible swing here too. 4@s is makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: last board in this tournament|pg||

mb|p!|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: 3 hard earned imps to the naturalists thanks to the dbl. in open room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: i mean just ignore the bids and bid like you normally would..many use x of 2c as stayman in that pos|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit. Fin jobb som vanligt!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well in a way he did. 1S denies a 4-card major and long diamonds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: And here is another chance|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 4 clubs hearts + clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Weird hand - East phsyched 1@S; East didn support wih AKxx, and, as Sverre said, N didnt bother to bid his @D...|pg||
mb|2D!|an|drury|nt|Walddk2: Yes, matches of 7 boards. One more match before the lunch break|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  6  @h tricks about the maximum output of the NS hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: May bid slam here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The naturalists do not promise major suit when they make take-out doubles|pg||
mb|4C|nt|loe48: i personally also use it..so system is on after bids|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1@d is strong if he has a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 1nt is 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: may have majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2@c shows minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: click on Sesjon 6 for latest update|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Even natural bidders dont pass 11 counts these days with 5 controls|pg||
mb|4S|nt|johnp: Stenberg (as Scandinavian named), invite or GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Liv Marit, great job!|pg||
nt|sveing: all like that 2@C bid? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be a swing for EW...S being conservative with this vul.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sverjohn: Pass was alerted. Probably asked for a xx by pd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not on that suit|pg||
nt|april7: the good position and a good guess in @S makes it here a slam, but not reachable, or maybe yes!!!??|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: EW plays 2@H as weak raise in @d or nat GF w@h|pg||
nt|sverjohn: RKCB will reveal 2 aces missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Nice breaks, not too common after this kind of auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this canape opening put this normal contract to different hand than else where -perhaps different opening lead -east leads @h to make that easy|pg||
nt|veistikke:  they should try, they need imp|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Had to keep his hands off that card |pg||
nt|veistikke:  looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 8 clubs and 3 diamonds?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  nvm|pg||
nt|veistikke:  :P|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: the crash in OR means that we are not connected right now, so there will be no link between the scores|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Thx to the Norwegian Bridge Federation for bringing us this event and to our brilliant operator, Liv Marit Grude!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sverjohn: Høyland trusts Bakke to have a stopper. Dont think Bakke agrees|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9: sorry don't see that here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sveing: 2@C are begging for trouble i think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: This match will end 12-11 - a VP tie I presume...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  4-3 fits tough enough but even tougher when the 4 card suit is taking the taps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphztc: sry, weak raise in @s|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Wise decision by Rekstad|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sverjohn: Good defensive bidding. West can hardly raise on his flat minimal hand|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Board 25 was 14 imps to Abax|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 4 hearts went for -500|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should gain 2 imps here NS|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: back in ten minutes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sverjohn: Passed the limit for a maximum 25VPs now ages ago|pg||
pc|sT|nt|veistikke:  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011lagbutler.htm Butler |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's @c spots guarantee 1 @c tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: should have plyed a diamond|pg||
nt|sverjohn: I think 1@s promises 5 in the Bakke-Høyland system, so he may have thought that Bakke had a singleton when not giving secondary support|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  trick|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Thoresen line better. Took the first diamond and ran the clubs|pg||
mc|12|nt|penseur9: OK good results at: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011nmpar.htm|pg||
nt|sverjohn: A suitable grand finale for a great team! Congrats to all!|pg||
