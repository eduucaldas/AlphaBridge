pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver|pg||
nt|april7: actually , after @D and @D ruff W should give up a @H as long he has ace of @S and making m5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both west supported on a good doubleton. Key bid to reach the heart game|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H*|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, easts :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Oliver|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N a bit too optomistic of N|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew are warned now -can they make rigth decision now+|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  but can't blame him since S simply asked for a @h stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h a very marginal overbid, but you have four trumps |pg||
nt|april7: if N switches to @S, contract is down, but very difficult|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 9 of diamonds discourage. Suggests a shift|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: W has then to cash Aand K of @H and play on @C,then also 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done champ!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Hei SG|pg||
nt|sveing: Hi Roland:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you shut out 2@s and 3@c from NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now, if North doesn't switch to a spade, this can make|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|oliverc: Yes. West might have struggled in 2@H, but little chance for Declarer now|pg||
nt|sveing: Tre knekter og ettS are leaders after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: More roads to one down here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Smat move by Marstrander, but declarer did not fall for it, and should not|pg||

nt|penseur9: thanks Hilde|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be better than 3nt with @d out ,but still down because bad sits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smart even|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 8 tricks, I fear|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CK could have been onside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would still give West 12 hcp for his opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to find 3 pitches|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oliverc: true|pg||

pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: club switch best but not enough|pg||
nt|sveing: easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: good position for NS, losing only at most 2 @S 1 @H and 1 @C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sveing: not enough but if she use the Q?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: does not matter|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 3@S & max|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sveing: yor are right|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: She has a pitch on @DK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: ligth takeout double and they found a game -now only to make /+1 -even perhaps|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|andersk: Even with @D K lead, u have nothin to discard @C on, so better find out where @C A is by playing @C|pg||
nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is that he will play E for J@s|pg||
nt|sveing: yepp|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Liv Marit, good morning to you|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liv|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: hi all :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Modern neg. double style. Denies 4 spades. Not suitable for 1 NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Bjørn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: S is Ekrens brother|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, this is Steinar Ekren I now see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Liv Marit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like need to find @SQ in 4@S unless pitch @D on 13th @C|pg||
mb|5D|nt|johnp: Hi all, ready now|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
nt|sverjohn: When in doubt, bid 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: a slam coming up but good save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could very well reach the normally nice grand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England most would respond as East - 1NT most likely|pg||
nt|april7: could be pushed to 7!!|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||

nt|sverjohn: This can go astray now. Rekstad may have shown a better hand|pg||
nt|april7: another swing here if it makes or going down, one way or other|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Not enough tricks for NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|andyv:  this should be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, the suit behaves so 4@s is safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure what he intended - only 13 HCP|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both sides overbidding here. Do not like Berset's 3 diamonds. What are his extras?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|johnp: Please adwise link for result and cam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps North might have tried 5@D en route - then South can take a swing at 5@S|pg||

pc|s8|nt|april7: always only 12 tricks!!but tempting to bid 7NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@S is wash&go|pg||

nt|johnp: @s slam but how to get there?|pg||
nt|penseur9: or more :)|pg||
nt|loe48: if they use lebensohl|pg||
nt|sverjohn: If spade queen doesnt drop, there is a chanceof establishing a club trick to ditch a diamond|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be some fireworks here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  might just bid 3N now|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't have enough hair to make that worthwhile :(|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|sverjohn: Good sacrifice|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what will South do here - pass most likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 2NT to be forcing, or better play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and needs to guess @DQ, with not a lot to go on|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 3@D is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would probably go down on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: And good decision by Berset|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because both contracts depend on @DQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that they can't beat 3NT, unfair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, on the spade layout, this has chances |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|johnp: 2@d=GF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All too predictable|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  a little bit of work...first tackle the easy suit..@hs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: south has some cards after north bids @s so slam found -guessed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody said life was fair |pg||
nt|april7: with a signletzon @H and a 5th @C slam would be on and S might have tried by bidding 5@S asking for second round control in @H, but iS is not strong anough|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|johnp: hm|pg||
nt|johnp: imo blind shot when bidding, but I am offside so...|pg||
nt|penseur9: will need to establish is @Ds first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 out of 2 right, time to retire|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Hard to blame North though, if he thought his partner's hand was relatively balanced   |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Open room copied the misdefence on hand 15|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andersk: good lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  @s suit will be a pleasent suprise to declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup: south must have been a little woryed of second round @h control ,but north had it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andersk: Almost impossible to avoid slam|pg||

nt|loe48: 6c or 6s is my guess here|pg||
nt|loe48: i think 6c is the best team spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 25%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the Discworld novels million-to-one chances come up nine times out of ten |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - these are 7 board matches so one hand can decide the entire match. Big lead to Abax now|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 3min break|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H opening by N and then....???let see what E does|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d!|nt|johnp: Another national champ (N)...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done by E-W in the open. Karlsen knows his pd. could be very aggressive in these situations|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  NS might get to a pushy 3N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: May have given a few back on the last hand. Impossible to picture pd with a single heart I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW are placed 3rd after four matches; NS 11th|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: some very forward bidding next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  isnt multi showing 6@s 6@h or a strong hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: top 8 ATM can win, I beleve 9th and further will be too far behind|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good idea|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sverjohn: Further actions from N-S could be expensive|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: 2@D equal length in the majors|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sveing: but i think he will bid that|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Karlsen knows to switch to a diamond when in with @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to do so|pg||
nt|april7: should be|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 4@s?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very unilateral|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as declarer is marked with @SAK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why not @H off dummy?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Dont like this type of deffending|pg||
nt|sverjohn: a killing lead.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2 diamond losers if he doesnt duck in trick one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9: EW presently in first and NS in 17th place|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did their job|pg||
nt|loe48: 1/4|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Maybe he thought his hand too weak for a 3h preempt vuln. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: greedy 3 @h -top was found already -now a lot of wotk to do|pg||
pc|s5|nt|loe48: 5h ask spade q|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: I think young Eide might be a little too agressive with a strong NT behind he's partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D5 was strange|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  S put to immediate guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: It complicates the defence|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|loe48: and 6s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may cause problems|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: I think 4 @H bid is forbidden, once you open weak!!! so he pays for it!!!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  now in danger of going down|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|johnp: Easy to say: lead @h, but we see all cards|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes we agreeded that at once :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could have been beaten with repeated diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: West now also had to rely on finesse with @C9 - perhaps a little lucky|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Spade Q gets promoted|pg||
nt|sharkey: claim|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|cA|nt|loe48: doesnt matter to much the guess|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|sveing: maybe better to use K of @S the first time.. then it could be a lead from AQJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be careful now, otherwise East might be endplayed with a spade   |pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes 4@c if he guesses to put in 10@h|pg||

nt|andersk: 2 down now|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|sveing: not use the card evryone nows you have:)|pg||

nt|april7: first of all, S could have the idea of pushing EW higher and now N spoiled it!!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Really?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  -1 down should be -2 |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: with @S9 high in dummy?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|loe48: but they to high..and in wrong spot to try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West had to rise @DK there|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|loe48: 3nt is a fair try ..and shall be tried vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  but hard to bid after the major suit showing by W|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: and Karlsen failed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: to lead a club through|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 9 matches of 7 boards today, 4 tomorrow to end the week long festival|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well in a way he did. 1S denies a 4-card major and long diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Weird hand - East phsyched 1@S; East didn support wih AKxx, and, as Sverre said, N didnt bother to bid his @D...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Yes, matches of 7 boards. One more match before the lunch break|pg||
