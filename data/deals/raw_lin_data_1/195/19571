pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|s5|nt|blum1956: that game was nonvulnerable, wasn't it?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|doks: but doubled|pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway Latvia hardly will lose 6+ imps on board 10 where Shadyro was down in 2@s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|zebutin: experienced players, not experienced pair nescesarily...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|wiki: NS ladies national team members playing  maye  magic diamond or stron club ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzka: NS plays strong club|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h also here 6-1 fit |pg||
mb|3D|nt|penseur9: another good bidding chalange for NS here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW a bit older guys (arle is junior - one month younger than me) but played in national team aout 1965-1985|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|psyck: there seem to be 10 tricks in a @c contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|wiki: and EW play natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 11th will come with fav @s's & @c 22|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|runnerup: bad contract should be down but some defence needed|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|wiki: somebody in NSwas lazy|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is enough @s lead and no chance to make|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|zebutin: might try to go after @H suit too, atleast with this development|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: that shift will speedup play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|zebutin: maybe jansons was thinking declarer having something like Axxx, 10x, xxx, Axxx or something on those lines, without @S return opponents can just give @H out and claim rest...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|zebutin: ofc that is only 8 point opening...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wiki: N promised a very good hand / maybe S should have bid once more / not easy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: dont ew know to take 1, @h strange|pg||
nt|zebutin: so declarer either has @H K or @S K on top of those atleast, if @H K seems quite hopeless, if @S K @D continuation might seem better...|pg||
