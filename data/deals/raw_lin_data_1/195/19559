nt|Walddk4: Wlc back Mohit|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: didn't he loose 2@D 1@S 1@C ?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dslee: west should be counting and re-counting now - what to bid !|pg||

mb|p|nt|mohitz:  hi Roland, PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS will do well to pass this out and beat it by one|pg||

nt|josj: don't think so as score might be wrong|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S for NS - 2NT and probably go from there |pg||
nt|mohitz:  NS play a relay based strong club system|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW play 2/1|pg||
nt|psridhar: did he go d3 ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: d2 only i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: on  17 only 140, we assume|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D promises only 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i have a lot of sympathy with 3nt here|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure what NS plays , looks like precision or some form of strong @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Mostly a partials hand - unless NS is too ambitious to reach a @H game which can be taken down in a good EW def|pg||
nt|psridhar: admittedly kushari might have held @d jack and @s ace wd give only 15 to South|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 sry|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dslee: No, sorry, think 4@H would always make|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: x is 5-7|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT shows an obvious @C join|pg||
nt|dslee: x from south - 2@C by Animesh and so on i guess from here?|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry 2@S by animesh- apologies for typo|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Jack of club was known, PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally 1N is passed with balanced 8 hcp -but 2Aces is different|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: which they will bid now :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  choice of minors from Animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: this cannot be a choice of minors :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess if responder has 4M, he could try |pg||
nt|psridhar: true yes he didnt open 1N so king of @s was an error costing 2 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: until told "officially" we have to accept what we are told|pg||
nt|dslee: i was been told by a kib that NS plays toad @C, not sure of this system|pg||
nt|dslee: he does not have support in @C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, he has a doubleton|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mohitz:  partner showed 6 odd clubs |pg||
nt|dslee: unless there is a specific understanding that the @C suit would be a quality one|pg||
nt|mohitz:  (presumably)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dslee: my 3@C would be all my points in @C with a one hole suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv invited there -not passed 1N|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|josj: hmm...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  looks like a misunderstanding on the meaning of 3@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mohit|pg||
nt|dslee: crack from banerjee asking for @C lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dslee: Hi mohit|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mohitz:  hi deb, tx roland|pg||
nt|psridhar: smoked out the @d queen :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dslee: i was seeing this come - maybe seeing manas and banerjee, I would not had xx even if the hand mandated for one|pg||

nt|Walddk4: also welcome to Srini, who is familiar with the N-S methods|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mohitz:  hi Srini|pg||
pc|h8|nt|strike12: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dslee: hi srini- can you explaing the toad @c system?|pg||
nt|dslee: I am sure Manas would have a word or two with amarnath after this hand :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing cricket one becomes accustomed to it:):(|pg||
nt|bobholl: if P has only 4@C @D necessary so seen good :)|pg||
nt|josj: they have replays nowadays :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mohitz:  rehi|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|josj: to overrule the umpires' clear views|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in 5@DXX, Animesh might have finessed diamond queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for -2|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: still only 8 tricks on @s hook failing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mohitz:  this wll be a quick claim|pg||
nt|strike12: it is basically a relay based strong club system, |pg||
nt|dslee: but how they dint reach this game or pass in 2@C with a @C lead?|pg||
nt|dslee: i mean 2@C x?|pg||
nt|strike12: X by N showed 5-7 so S shd bid game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: unless India are involved:)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: TV cameras in cricket nowadays ?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mohitz:  i guess North showed his hand yes|pg||
nt|strike12: 2c X is 19+|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
mc|8|nt|josj: communications for declarer are very bad on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least cricket is played by a lot of dutchmen although their orange strip is not too traditional from the english point of view|pg||

pc|h9|nt|rodal f: For shure no screen|pg||
nt|kemperg: anyone also 3@H instead of 4@S?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: Now declarer has 4 club tricks and entry to cash them. He has 8 tricks ready and can set up a spade for 9th|pg||
nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small heart is most promising for defenders.  maybe W has the ace|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off:(|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mcsd: 2@H|pg||
nt|mcsd: - 9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|007 joosth: diamonds was ok if W has KJ|pg||
nt|bagman: That @DT might have been the only card to beat 3NT if N had AQJxx Axxx 7x AT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|007 joosth: needs 2 specific cards   but the advantage is that a good guess by declarer is impossible|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

nt|dslee: i dont know his father but I know animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|strike12: yes should be flat board|pg||
nt|dslee: for all the kibbers, Mohit is one of the very promising indian youngstars from Bangalore|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H or 2@S from EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: OR may climb to 2N and if he misguesses @d queen , can be down a bunch|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i dont think you can stop in 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: or in 4@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if inviting, North will accept surely|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D might be opened too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: last hand , would had preferred a 2@S from Manas probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@H all pass probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  colors not right for North to enter the auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: if a purist 1@d opening then it can get to 2N |pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  3@C is just down 1 though|pg||

nt|psridhar: 1@d-1n-2n all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 2c is trs|pg||
nt|mohitz:  So, EW play precision too |pg||
mb|1D|nt|strike12: with min 5 @d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW can make upto 3@H on correct guesses|pg||
nt|psridhar: precn will get to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mohitz:  if opening 1@D, East will probably overcall |pg||
nt|psyck: i thought either 1N or 1@c would get to game, surprisingly both didn't :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and that might affect the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but +1 ??|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm, i seen this lot of people playing 1@C-2@C as @D transfer - now it has got rare|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is fine too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  not sure why East didnt bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, Animesh isn't the one to go down peacefully! |pg||
nt|mohitz:  anyway, another 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar: tightens the match good|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mohitz:  PS, what defense do you play after this auction|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mohitz:  1@C prec followed by 1N rebid that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: why not a simple 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|strike12: i like 2nt with @d stuff|pg||
nt|dslee: i would hate to hide my master suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: same as 1N opg|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mohitz:  defenders have to establish a heart trick|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that seems convenient but i am convinced its right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  because presumably with both majors etc, we would have entered over 1@D itself?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *not|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the context of no bidding in the earlier round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  no, but say you play 1@C - p - 1@D - X as both majors|pg||
nt|psridhar: pass and bid in immd position -south here- i play as strong ; in North it is balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: no quesitons asked :)|pg||
nt|dslee: best thing to do is play @D|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@D looks like -1|pg||

nt|mohitz:  yea, make now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mohitz:  heart shift best|pg||
nt|mohitz:  will declarer lose control?|pg||

nt|dslee: not showing extras|pg||
nt|dslee: again typo|pg||
nt|mohitz:  no biggie, might earn an IMP too|pg||
nt|psridhar: that was an unwise operation by kastaubh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dslee: does EW play tartan?|pg||
nt|strike12: looks like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not so much fun when we dont have the convention cards |pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh dear, East has revoked while defending 5@H |pg||
nt|mohitz:  in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: can south pass on this?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would a clear maximum even :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or double - tough choice imo|pg||
mb|1S|nt|strike12: this will be costly|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT here shows min @H support 3@C is pass or correct to 3@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mohitz:  i like 2@S by West here opposite a passed hand, gives them more trouble :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: another possiblity :)|pg||
nt|strike12: good X by N|pg||
nt|dslee: obvious one |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, the lead extends for railways|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: when do they open 1@D? this was a @D opening ideally playing the strong @C system - 1NT open would had been a little ambitious though|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for example, here is West bids 2@S, North must bid 2N which might be a level high|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *if|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvz: MOUSE PROBLEM SRY|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: well if n/s play precision 1@D MIGHT BE 0+|pg||
nt|josj: 1@H we had not thought of but it solves the problem to perfection|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: -1 or -2 depending on def and play - this x by N is penalty? I guess no|pg||
nt|psridhar: north has played this game b4 and pass 2@s like he did in Bd no 30|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay, but that might be wrong on days|pg||
nt|psridhar: on more days your 2@S will be taken to the cleaners|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|josj: they do|pg||
nt|mohitz:  East wont like the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YES THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE OFTEN HAVE THE BEST POINT OF VIEW|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D passed out scores best :)|pg||
nt|dslee: yah, often we dont like our dummies - seldom we do :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  he wanted to get his spade suit in|pg||
nt|mohitz:  also preempts 1@H overcalls|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not a bad strategy in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|mohitz:  i actually don't think there is a lot of risk of being taken to the cleaners if partner knows our style|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner may have no role to play |pg||
nt|mohitz:  true i agree sometimes it might go pass pass X etc|pg||
nt|psyck: no more poorly than the 3N in other room|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but in my (limited) experience it works out quite well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mohitz:  how did you figure -1?|pg||
nt|strike12: @d shift now|pg||
nt|dslee: lets see - if its a penalty, E has a lot of clues now|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|strike12: lucky|pg||
nt|dslee: this would be a @S partial for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: .|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing standard, the auction might go 1N all pass|pg||
nt|drkvas:  3nt seems to be the favorite destination|pg||
nt|mohitz:  they will open 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, both the sides plays strong @C|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i mead on many deals like 3 4 2 9 etc|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure if they top it by 1NT 15-17|pg||
nt|drkvas:  did not q|pg||
nt|strike12: so QF seems to be of 10 X 3 format|pg||
nt|dslee: is that a smoke break?|pg||
nt|dslee: thanks to me and your MIL :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  both the tables are on bd 6|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess only one can play them at a time|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i request ps to commentrate pls he is the best in buissiness in india|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, kaustubh did bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Dipak doubled which seems like a mistake|pg||
nt|psyck: N did not have any good choice on 2@s |pg||
nt|psridhar: he had a GOOD choice alright -pass ; but he needed to think of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess operator forgot one high @C :)|pg||
nt|josj: definitely :)|pg||
nt|dslee: very friendly cards for NS here|pg||
nt|dslee: all spots with the opps in the right places|pg||
nt|psyck: not yet reached Kushari's level i guess :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  true PS but if i bid 1@S, he doesn;t have to think of anything|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|strike12: @h- Min 4 card @s|pg||
nt|drkvas:  hey des p is here|pg||
nt|dslee: Hey P, welcome |pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: transfer?|pg||
nt|strike12: will u bid 1nt  frm N?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  can make 4@S |pg||
nt|mohitz:  but will play a spade partial|pg||
mb|1D|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i feel if ur playing strong @c 15 17 nt makes no sense|pg||
nt|dslee: Raj 1 has to pull up in next 10, this I guess is gone for them|pg||
nt|drkvas:  u can play 14 15 if u like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  putting up all nt ranges in 1@C hurts during competition|pg||
nt|dslee: no 1NT here from E?|pg||
nt|dslee: N for his pass is assumed to hold a @H length and @S short|pg||
nt|psridhar: there are other objectives to bidding than just give your lho a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 3nt by N is best but difficult to reach now ...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n frivilous interference hurts too|pg||
nt|strike12: 1@h is specifically 4 @s so E might wait and watch here|pg||
nt|dslee: since 1@S is opened , they can take off to 4 now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this looks an inevitable 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: W comes to rescue|pg||
nt|strike12: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: S has the values for at least one raise now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@S opening is systemic|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will invite|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and North will reject i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  better play not play in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: maybe N is considering a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a push too time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|josj: remote...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, east opened 1N all pass|pg||
nt|dslee: would had bid 3@S here if at all|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in NT, defenders can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dslee: not the most obvious lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas:  i think rajasthans team is an adhoc 1|pg||
nt|mohitz:  opposite a PH, that has to be one of the primary objectives imo|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway i dont endorse 2@s and not interested in discussing its merits /demerits|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mohitz:  South might bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  fair enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|bobholl: kind of slamtry may be :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: SUBTLE SLAM TRYS are not my cup of tea - capable of misleading pard|pg||
nt|mohitz:  good lead for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|dslee: late realization doc, left a message for P before the game itself :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: too many cooks will spoil DSL ; u r all doing fine go ahead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: if P has xx AKxx AQx Kxxx slam is fairly good :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well done|pg||
nt|mohitz:  now the small matter of guessing spade Queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|dslee: no chance of going down in traditional play now :)|pg||
nt|dslee: unless N thinks of pulling up some staunts|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what is traditional play?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: this may be finis|pg||
nt|drkvas:  p is now an international commentrator leaves these to lesser mortals|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|josj: no way :)|pg||
nt|josj: they're just starting it now|pg||
nt|roswolf: upwards and onwards we soar|pg||
nt|dslee: taking the fin is the directions usually taken in practice|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing West for Queen is better because you can cater to Queen singleton either side that way |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: brakes are needed|pg||

mb|1D|nt|strike12: N might X showing penalty in 1 major|pg||
nt|mohitz:  another 4@S that might make|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but unlikely to be bid|pg||

mb|3S|nt|strike12: yes what would pass and 2@d convey here then?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, it depends on agreements|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  trying to work out which of 2@s and 2@d are clearly forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  scope for an accident here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i like ten clear 2NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S sounds natural to me...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but as NS were trying to play in @s, East should work it out|pg||
nt|josj: E can see it, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at another vulnerability, E might think NS have psyched|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 3@C on xxxx is no pancake either :)|pg||

nt|mohitz:  3N is a stretch to say the least|pg||

nt|mohitz:  another partial|pg||

nt|mohitz:  2N can be defeated on good defense|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: so Kepri just recorded the biggest swing of the match so far, no less than 4 imps|pg||

nt|dslee: only penalty|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing else|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: maybe 2nt leb|pg||

nt|roswolf: penalty axe!?|pg||
nt|josj: just -1...|pg||
nt|josj: but better than -200|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is hands off penalty after a leb 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a swing of 250 anyway :)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobholl: depends on what the maximum for 2NT is but he guesses rigth|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mohitz:  so, NS will get a heart, 2 clubs and two diamond tricks eventually for -1|pg||
nt|drkvas:  good choice by s bihar on a roll|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: 1NT or pass?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bagman: bad hand, some fit, nonvulnerable; generally right to bid, though|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if W is strong with hearts  E has big hand, so I like 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pass can't be right when opponents are vul!|pg||

nt|bagman: E has practically no defense|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: should anyone have bid 4D?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|007 joosth: maybe N i think|pg||
nt|bagman: probably, but they are in 3@D now and declarer is likely to make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|bagman: When EW bid up to 3 level on marginal values they often have 9 trumps; this information often helps the opponents to estimate the level of fit|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rv: yes strong @c systems facilitate bidding these hands where one hand is very strong, std 2@c does pre-empt auction|pg||

nt|josj: a|pg||
nt|rv: I would have passed with North instead of bidding 3n, if South had redoubled showing first round control, then 3@s would have been perfect|pg||
nt|mohitz:  these guys play a relay based system |pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: or passing even as rv suggests|pg||

nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pulling 3NT seems strange. He did bid his spades three times before that|pg||
