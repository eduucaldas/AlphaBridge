mb|4H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|vugraphzkk: after rdbl yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: good pressure bid by Prabhakar, Tewari's redouble and now Sinha will run even if he had any doubts earlier|pg||

nt|bebechira: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Netherlands are 7th currently, which means they have plenty of motivation (6th place goes to the world championship)|pg||

nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
nt|kemperg: so an important match|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like this can make, losing a @C, 2@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CK and @DK weel placed, no problems |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco bid quite little with minor monster, but partner doesn't have @C J so 5@D seems most likely to go down, would need 2 entries in Rubinos hand + ruff to raise diamond suit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Johan|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H (trf)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi all thx rito|pg||
pc|s2|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||

nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Bob.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've see Birman lead 4th instead of 3rd, starting to wonder about that|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR W in 3@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: very simple equation for Agustin and co... they must win.. and win big|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  italy still has a tiny chance of winning this tournament...they need a huge win and a huge defeat by israel, not very likely but you never know|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  belgium is second to last but has done ok with an experimental team|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eliran_a: hi all and welcome going to be a great match ! 1st against the 2nd !|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: on a @C lead RK has to guess the @Hq|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: still only 8 tricks as @Ds dont break|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||

nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc would never missed that in my own hometown|pg||
nt|zebutin: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: but Israel will probably have to say something about this ....|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we must say that they had a great tournament.. fantastic players|pg||
nt|richie: probably, let's see, it has already been proven they are excellent players but  not infallable|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol... |pg||
nt|bebechira: Eliran will say something about this for sure....|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Markku|pg||
pc|h8|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||

pc|hK|nt|chick: will go down 3 against a partscore at best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||

nt|doks: 15 round of Juniors Championship 3rd and 7th place match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: only 5 tricks in the closed it seems.... so what is 2 imps between friends|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: north thinkinh|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a flat board of 10 tricks in hearts contract|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  note that 6@s is a bad contract but not completely hopeless. all you need is spades 3-2, diamonds 3-2 and 2 spades with 2 diamonds (or bare @d QJ)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sitting well enough to make 4@h|pg||
nt|richie: many people will bid 1NT in north, but I like dbl more when you hold only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: England had a steady start in the test vs India... cricket of course|pg||
nt|szalay:  hi all!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||
nt|bebechira: team profiles Netherlands http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: byæ mo¿e nie wszyscy wiedz¹, ¿e Joanna Taczewska to Joanna Krawczyk - chyba najbardziejutytulowana juniorka na wiecie, która z³ote medale zdeobywa³a tak¿e w reprezentacji open ...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: juniorskiej |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but N would not have been doubling for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: not only is it a level lower, but it would double to game, whereas NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: so it's safer, and might push the opps too high, whereas 4@S has all the downsides|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1nt overcall maybe not to everyones taste, in zone, with 14hcp and 5card major...|pg||
nt|szalay:  I'm GyÃ¶rgy Szalay from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi György|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a really funny 1N call|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like 4 @C tricks, 2 @H tricks, but 7th might be a problem|pg||
nt|szalay:  u know crazy man or genious: depends on outcome|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||
nt|zebutin: in club suit defender could try to toss 10 or J under A, to give declarer option of finese for 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: *thinking|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||

nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=FRANCE@@892|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT looks like being beaten by a S lead from either side|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@C is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I wonder if they can find it after west showing both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 2d=good raise|pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood to Israel|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s went 3 down, first imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay:  do u mean stiff J/T?|pg||
nt|szalay:  in that case West could lead that (6card)|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable 2@H now ?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east has to make this against a probable pass out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: after a redbl this shd be a penalty dbl|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes sunil :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and Swapan shd pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and he has a chance with this lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes this difficult |pg||
nt|richie: "blood" ? :) they score in IMPS not in blood|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: uffffffff|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Sarkar|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi sunil :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT very good in closed room, only 9 triks in 4@H withot defencive help|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good start ther to play @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: dhamapur, Vijay Anand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
nt|zebutin: would he? with 2card support to partners major and only 1 entry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Souren is recalculating hands, and in deep thought|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|szalay:  but he has at least 2@Ds and 2 @s..|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: well... i would argue this in this match|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bebechira: Schwartz in 3nt|pg||
nt|eliran_a: only if west had 3 hearts 4@h could go down on a @s lead now as the cards set nothing can take it down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks beatable|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT can be defeated with a @clead or return, 4@h is shaky but it should make|pg||
nt|richie: Madala fears @cA is wrong for him...|pg||

nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will not helped this time|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  probably down now if N or S switches to hearts on time|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and may decide this match against Poddar|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Kiran forgot to lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||

nt|bcmandal: 4h better no?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Had to play D the other way|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a club now|pg||
nt|richie: but he has no other chance then playing 2@d, and a @c to K|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Poddar is the treasurer of the National Federation and also the sponser of this tourney.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|bebechira: 3off for 500?|pg||
nt|eliran_a: if madala is playing now @s to the ace he will probably would go down as west jump with the @HA and plays a club for ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|doks: and now 11 also|pg||
nt|chick: even that wouldn't have saved him|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|chick: the 9 holds up|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|richie: intesting line of play :) she's playing rather fast|pg||

pc|d8|nt|runnerup: so bad guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|richie: probably she did not play the K|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, 5@h is only made when you have no heart loosers|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ntmon: key play was a club to K in case E has less than 4 hearts |pg||
nt|eleni: she has to keep it up cross-ruffing though |pg||
nt|josj: what is (not) happening?|pg||
nt|eleni: Minko?|pg||
nt|eleni: what is happening pls?|pg||
nt|zebutin: Italy trailing by 14 vp leading Israel...so they would need big wins from last 3 rounds to get to 1st place|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|nt|richie: also a nice lead, maybe it will be a push then|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Could have made 7 tricks, but.....|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: and if north leads a @S the side entry will disappear|pg||
nt|bebechira: Cook out...|pg||

mb|p|nt|gio 89: italy doing not so good, down 36 at the moment|pg||

nt|vugraphzkm: Som is thinking bending his legs up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh puppet stayman, I keep forgetting that|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @s can be dwfeated here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes D not good enough the other way declarer played properly|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: jitu discussing lead with Suresh|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: & than pass:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will bending legs help the brain work better ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|richie: they may even get to 4@s, dbl-ed in south?|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR @CQ is the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: -west argees and 500?|pg||
nt|richie: west has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Even a slamtry :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ohh well:) a few imps for sweeden|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think I like 3N with the E hand even though there is a remote chance of finding a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: a few only ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now should be fine|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N and find partner with xx in @S or @C :(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c artificial showing all types of strong hands, to which 2@d is a positive response|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D vul against non-vul.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so Poddar pull back... this shd surely be a swing for them|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 100% sunil|pg||
pc|s5|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: dror have a nice hand but still his daimonds are useless|pg||
nt|eliran_a: not a good hand to raise with for a game|pg||
nt|zebutin: they sailed in to 5@H on other room, so might be good gain for Netherlands|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wonder if south knows about the 4 card fit though|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello Sunil & all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|2hplus4: Good lead when dummy is known to be short in D|pg||
nt|richie: is 3@h semi-natural? east could also bid 3@d as invitation|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 2 down if the defence finds the @h ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  apparently not|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
nt|richie: @H2 is a clear indication|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi ck welcome :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: disappointment coming|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: very timid of Swapan t pass with a 6 card @H i thk|pg||

nt|bcmandal: had he played k?|pg||
nt|doks: @H are blocked now, can be hard|pg||
pc|hA|nt|richie: maybe she hoped that opps would dbl 4@s or overbid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Next|pg||

nt|bebechira: same sequence in the open room... Fisher thinking what to do|pg||
nt|richie: another light opening? or preempt in east?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know that a @C lead would have been much better :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and he bid 4nt...this can be a big swing for Italy|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s -you must avoid @s finess -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: yea , its becoming more and more common to respond the opening bid with negative hands , less then 6 points |pg||
nt|richie: I would dbl in south, your hearts are a bit too weak to bid them and you have some alternatives|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S could return the 9@H for @S and then it was -2.|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the two boards scores will cancel each other out :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: on deal no 22 jitu & dipak bid 4 @S :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: should play in part score|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
nt|eliran_a: also x from north here|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, west will bid 4@s, no matter what, north dbl I think |pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sure it will CK|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||

nt|eliran_a: this should be end the action|pg||
mb|d|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@d denies 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this is the only available game try |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  difficult call by south but he apparently had no problems to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||
nt|doks: very nice fitted hands, but dont see reason 4@S bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a heart lead looks normal|pg||
nt|zebutin: not much competition for 4@S in N/S...making (and might make even overtrick)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I 've great fan of Israel way to play bridge|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But not in this match|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A tough choice for W there|pg||
nt|andyv:  being Greek, I was rooting for Zambia|pg||
nt|richie: only when declarer decides to finesse in @s he may go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: quess to do make/ down -spades finess -or club J -south|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Birman 2@s openening is a good weak 2 8-10 points |pg||
nt|eliran_a: sry only in 1st and 2nd seat . so here its weak 2 6-10|pg||
nt|richie: even in 3rd?|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely they now get 2@H + @H ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||

nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: dummy always tables the jack when I lead K from KQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
pc|s5|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now down|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he is young man man so they love attacking leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure he ducked?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  11 makeable now?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i dont like the 1@s replay by west after the double, with such a poor suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|sA|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|s6|nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Nice balance by Swapan here... both 1 nt and 2@D shd make|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: how sunil?:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 1 down here|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 2 more @C tricks & 1 @S :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was busy counting the winners that i lost count of the losers :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has no confidence in partners bid:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing strong K we lead the Q here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks like 2 down vulnerable if they find the @h ruff|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  which they will find, madala is just hesitating between playing hearts rightaway or a minor first|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||

nt|richie: 6NT is a slightly better bid I think, to protect @dK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: on deal no 23 final contract was also 4 @S there :) hence no loss for maharaja :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 23 a push after all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe @C fin as a kind of avoidance play to keep S from getting entry and playing @Ds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a 1 imp swing here|pg||
nt|zebutin: couple ducks in @C to save entries?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D-bergen, good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so Hult upgraded the hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||
nt|bebechira: king of spades is nicely placed :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure as p was protective side |pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  west has the ideal distribution for a take out double in last position|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s seems normal, needs some careful declarerplay|pg||
nt|richie: @s leads helps fortunately, now declarer has time to finesse twice in diamonds and also to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||

pc|cT|nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is the only lead to set 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
nt|kemperg: but I ment the 4@S in N|pg||
pc|c7|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||

nt|loe48: er vanskelig aa ungaa aa komme ut med de korta|pg||
nt|ntmon: in fact, there is no danger at 2@S - just partner should be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|josj: costs 100 more now...a great chance missed by Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... where?|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier rather|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||
nt|josj: even|pg||
nt|eleni: had Rosaline passed after the 2@h by Flavia, things would have been easieer for N-S|pg||

mb|1S|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||

nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess Birman was going to bid 2@C if Padon bids 1@H|pg||

nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: maybe Birman can bid a "bad" 2NT here as Padon surely has a fit in one of the minors|pg||
nt|eliran_a: the action gonna end in 3cl|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c is some invitational hand with 6+@c I think|pg||

nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||

nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||

nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||

nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@S should make with the favorable @H lie|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad or scramble, 2N is goaad|pg||
nt|kemperg: good|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: favorable @S lie too, need two entries to finesse twice|pg||
nt|kemperg: my typing is bad today:(|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4 of a minor makes too|pg||

pc|c5|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||

pc|c8|pg||

nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
nt|2hplus4: These 5 major + 4 minor bids are fine if you win the auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt can be beaten on double dummy defence... not easy on table|pg||

nt|bebechira: france |pg||
nt|richie: yes, they overjumped them - poor swedes at the open room, they missed a few chances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If you defend, it is almost double dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|richie: I am not sure if NS can enter the bidding, but there is a greater risk EW will play in @d|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they are on their way to the slam.. and it is not easy to bid after 1nt!|pg||
nt|psyck: Precision? not sure why 1@D by W|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: low @D to Q and @C shft will beat 3 nt by West|pg||

pc|h6|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this goes dont with normal play perhaps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|doks: by the way, Denmark take 3rd place now, by leading 22-0 vs Poland|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
nt|richie: farce?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the it seems like 4@s should make even with a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W tried to pull trump immediately which cause the loss of control on hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It seems normal to cash @CAK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco going down...so 13 to Israel soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: now he is going down|pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 3@c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|szalay:  if East doent open:|pg||
nt|szalay:  may be go down now|pg||
nt|szalay:  for small@H switch|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib says : 2@S shows 5 diffirent hands...3 spade show 1354 with intrest in slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 4@D was setting the suit?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
nt|szalay:  no its 3easy|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i think it is better to pass 3@D as west|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: sneaky switch|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but west can see that everything works for declarer, so why not|pg||
nt|kemperg: only entries are in trump, that's leaders problem|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess @C Queen|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is correct and needs two finesses @C and @D.|pg||
nt|psyck: Not a bad 8 for me, shape, intermediaries etc, I'd bid 1N on 1@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he is home|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has to very careful not to lose control of hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  now no problems|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have 1000+ spectators wow... fantastic for the young players|pg||
nt|andreasw:  knowing where @h K is and later finding @d Q would be a small sign of W having it? |pg||
nt|bobholl: has to guess @D too :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makeable but not a good slam imo.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not a good slam ? can finesse both way in both suit wich needs finessing and @h K can be well placed?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slams which are dependent on placement of particular cards cant be called good.|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is better than a roland slam but not good enough :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this looks like at least down 2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|murat e: draw trumps play a heart north takes and must exit with another heart|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well done by Wackwitz|pg||
nt|runnerup: now +1|pg||
nt|eliran_a: now dror should play club to make it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bebechira: the swedish girls are my favourites for the bronze|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
nt|szalay:  sure East has the Ace|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: u hv a point here but why take NT away from the 1 @C opener|pg||
pc|hA|nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: not to be fooled|pg||
nt|zebutin: well Di Franco has told the points...but small @H would give some option... @H J gives no chance for defence|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: Although theres always the possibility that pd has a bust hand, and you get dbled.|pg||
nt|eliran_a: -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: so make|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok =|pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankbo: den var ikke bra|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I'm not sure, but would not mind an upgrade with 2 tens|pg||
nt|uttam: -2|pg||
nt|josj: -1, next|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||
nt|richie: still not easy to defend this, Magdalena will play @c now, west will have to play a spade at one point|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eleni: -1 is a good score for Italy|pg||
nt|szalay:  but I say if East is passin in 1st hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bebechira: welcome to Bas van Beijesterveld|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h and 3@h were a bit too much...|pg||
nt|szalay:  pass is often undervalued move|pg||
nt|szalay:  he had 11 anyway:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, then you could quess wrong sure...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  trying to find out where the houners are sitting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: and 3imps|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rv: pre-empt 2@h even with weak 4 card OM seems rite at these colors on East hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|suketbombi: needs a @C lead if they get to 6@D|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h by Tewari shows good raise in @ds|pg||
nt|rv: Tewari's 3@h usually denies 4@s unless sufficient extras|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will here come a new swing? E was near 2@C but agree his 1@S open.|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 stikk der i motspill om ikke 3|pg||
nt|ntmon: the preemt did not paid off, indicated !Q at N|pg||
nt|mrdct: usually right to pass it out in 4th seat if you don't have the @s suit|pg||
nt|spenny80: strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: P + number of @S = pass with <15|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 5/5 11count and a major...|pg||
nt|richie: the more conservative approach in the open room is paying off so far|pg||
nt|richie: hello Marleen :) excited to watch your team?|pg||
nt|neobas: Thanks Traian :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, 2H worked well in assuring a heart lead, but i wouldnt have bid it on a 4 count. And 3H..... well.... :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Fisher in 3d in brd 5 as well ...so that will be flat|pg||
nt|zebutin: but you know 11 is mandatory opening with balanced in junior games...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba W wistowa³ przeciwko 3 BA?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|eleni: right Vladimir|pg||
nt|spenny80: I open|pg||
nt|richie: when France and Sweden both have the same number of VPs, France will probably become third, they won the match against sweden 18-12|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oosb: But would you have dbled with South's hand?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i don't|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden got a lead of 12 now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north has a nice hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 3nt here ,but you never know|pg||
nt|szalay:  its not true|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east took the right decision to withdraw from 3nt undoubled, as 5@d x -1 is a better result than what would have happened in 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: no discard , doubleton @s with S|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|loe48: its very fast to get out on thoose..but a cleat 1s opener imo|pg||
nt|loe48: clear|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: opposite a weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: En interresant hand. |pg||
nt|neobas: Hey all - There was a duplication error which meant that board 20 was duplicated into board numbers 20 and 21. The boards they cannot play will be replaced with new ones. However, ...|pg||
nt|neobas: due to the operator not having the file with the hand recrods, we will probably not be able to broadcast it on BBO, regretfully|pg||
nt|richie: these north hands are problematic in many systems: many points, no stopper, no 4+@S |pg||
nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  5 cl in other room here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the Dutch girls now to recover some imps?|pg||
nt|garden2005: pa³uj|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
nt|2hplus4: france made 3NT on 2NT hand. declarer played a D at trick 2 which was ducked|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: just need AK of @H for 6 |pg||
nt|kemperg: tried for 6, will now bid4, S showed a minimum|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H likely some sort of minimum|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@d to takie silniejsze BA jak widaæ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|doks: after quite partscore, doubled slam deal|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, they did open in other room too, but opened with 1@C, so S could not come in with x|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: still trying|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pos³uszny|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and 3 card trump :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: 4 of 6 hands go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
nt|chick: poor defense doesn't count :)|pg||
nt|chick: finally EW bid hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Counted for about 15 IMPs there!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ur stars may not be good today Rito :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
nt|doks: other room Lightner double discover @S suit and @DQ as well|pg||
nt|garden2005: wist kierowy najlepszy na 3NT i na 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D+2@C+1@S=5, -1. and no disposal of losers.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Suddha here, not Rito|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: on the other q-final formidables v/s shree cement are on tie after 25th deal :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry Suddha|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks ok on the surface, but there is a forcing defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: its a 50% slam|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT overcall here, even though you don't have a double stopper you have plenty of tricks available - 2@c overcall would make life much more complicated|pg||
nt|garden2005: raczej wygra niestety, przez trefle|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: korzystna pozycja trefli dla rozgrywaj¹cego - krótka 9-ka ale jeszcze trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if you look at it the way i do:D.. it is almost a 100% slam unless the is a ruff out likeig @S where sitting 9-0|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: @S are not in picture this deal here. Goes for @D slam probably|pg||
nt|chick: yes, counts for score but not for whether to bid it or not :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would quess kind of "puppet" sequence, 3nt telling 5c @H and 4@D transfering to it|pg||
nt|szalay:  couldnt: instead of it: didnt|pg||
nt|szalay:  I think if u have 3.3 majors, u can|pg||
nt|szalay:  yes, u can:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now with everthing wrong for decl|pg||
nt|zebutin: this might need some help from defence|pg||
nt|szalay:  no other option than @C lead, imho|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  look s like north is describing an invitational hand with 5@h and 4+@d|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great job so far|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
nt|atalok: slmlar|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a Cl lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s on last board for Ita to|pg||
nt|szalay:  sgtrongly doubt North could switch another than @S|pg||
nt|szalay:  @D is ok if pd has stiff K/A of @H and @D honour to 3 (exactly)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba Tuczek pokryje 10-kê trefl królem?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this may well go down too|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||

pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
nt|atalok: yorumcu olarak sadece ben varým herhalde artýk idare edersiniz.|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: not now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: tx|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: play stopped|pg||
pc|h2|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
nt|doks: E expected more from W 3@D bid, so both Q must be found|pg||
nt|doks: very big swing on air|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes either way|pg||
nt|chick: or as someone points out, a simpler club ruff :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  club lead is most comfortable for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
nt|2hplus4: C ruff gets it over quickly but even so declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||

nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||

nt|spenny80: reasonable bidding|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|richie: yes but I think even the other 3 countries (Sweden, France and Italy) have a chance for silver or even gold when they perform well in the next three matches - they all play against ...|pg||
nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||

nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||

nt|spenny80: now i was better to bid 2@h not 3@c, to show raise @c (pass before) and long @h|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or make something yourself, like here|pg||
nt|richie: yes, dbl is perfectly fine of course|pg||
nt|richie: Israelians show their superiority|pg||
nt|bebechira: great bunch of kids...a great program as well for bridge development|pg||
nt|bebechira: World Champions and veryy soon European Champions|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman might affraid of a an overruff in @D and ruff with the @dA whice is doesnt matther the hand always makes |pg||
pc|d6|nt|timve:  well....|pg||
nt|timve:  this is lucky for th Italitans, they cannot stop, while knowing they miss 2 aces|pg||
nt|timve:  but luckily for them @HK is onside|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the juniors Israel is edging ahead...they will be hard to stop.... may be Agustin will have something to say about this|pg||
nt|doks: even @S are 3-3 and @H 3-3  I cant see from where 11th trick can come|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  1nt was probably a tactical bid, hoping for a @s lead against nt|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  3@s was a splinter and there i think east got scared of his own bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|asig: *lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: such a X is normally for T/O|pg||
nt|mrdct: possibly 2 down if @h misguessed|pg||
nt|spenny80: A@h is probably in W when she see Q@d K@c and probably Q@s....|pg||
nt|richie: france 158  sweden 157|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't want to be in 3NT on this deal|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  he has 3 cards that could be important for partner so 4@h was an underbid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: I don't see how this can go down|pg||
nt|spenny80: it would be very strange|pg||
nt|ntmon: a thrilling contract, why not to look at|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|richie: clearly some moment of misconcentration|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2down for 1 imp?|pg||
nt|bebechira: and israel in veldhoven in october... great results|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|loe48: also a thin neg x vul from w|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if e play @h when she take with Q@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good play by Cilla not to win her @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you have trump length you don't want to release your big card too early|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Same goes for Axxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It probably does not matter here, but she showed very sound technique|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will pay off in the long run|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: now @C guess :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|_fonzie__:  and i would never have continued bidding with wests hand after 4@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|murat e: one of the well on paper but doomed slams...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I guees, many pairs will - without this anti-bridge-@d-bid - will come too high here|pg||
nt|asig: (and obviuos, too)|pg||
nt|spenny80: Gib says +1, but only seeing all cards|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree with GIB :)|pg||
nt|josj: he plays them so well...|pg||
nt|spenny80: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na widno sz³o 12 lew w BA|pg||
nt|richie: here it can also still go wrong|pg||
nt|richie: but @c back by east seems normal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|timve:  nice lead by Sigrid|pg||
nt|bebechira: Murdoch father and son at westminster live...very rarely you see a media mogul questioned on live TV|pg||
nt|zebutin: now opponents get ruff in @H... needed to duck the lead for that not happening, but that is playing with open cards|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  to answer specs questions, running scores are on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@h did show 3 card support|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|atalok: polonya ve türkiye altyapýsýnýn farký hemen hemen ayný deklerasyon biz kontur atýp 470 veriyoruz onlar pas diyor.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: that means 0 trust to partners bidding|pg||
nt|jkotor: aha, tu po polskiemu|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gronkvist:  This deal is easy when u play natural minors openingsbid|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and i'm not sure about the meaning of 4@s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Som 6@H med fargen 3-3 eller finne 10X contra KX|pg||
nt|richie: they Israelian juniors are extremely impressive... also in White House Juniors this year they overclassed all other teams - and likely to get another gold medal here too|pg||
nt|bebechira: I vugraphed Israel in the semis and in the final in Philadelphia and they are a very good team|pg||
nt|richie: professional team almost, some of the players even are pros|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K and @H makes it very difficult|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i think its just blackwood, to which east answered that he has 2 keycards and no @h queen|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|murat e: both finesses wrong trumps 3-1 clubs dont break etc.etc....|pg||
nt|marionmi:  also not too risky|pg||
nt|richie: one board was scored wrongly in the Match Poland-France, Sweden again on third position!|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is good news for the swedish girls|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|bebechira: i am looking at the comentary in the open room... and it was incredible for the comentators|pg||
nt|richie: do you agree with multi Traian or old-fashioned 3@H?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The TD has called in open room about the bidding on board 7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  And a later @D-Jack-switch will be a nise moment for North|pg||
nt|mrdct: tap the dummy now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now 7 pointed suitt cards placed in each hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and 3 trumps with east... so odds favour plg West for @Cq|pg||
pc|d4|nt|richie: and a big disappointment for "the frogs", or are they all watching 'le tour de france'?|pg||
nt|jkotor: i s³usznie :P|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@C and small @H, can it work.|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  for those of you inquiring, the advantage of playing 4@s as blackwood when hearts are trumps is that when you get a 5@c response, you can ask for trump queen; and when you get 5@d or 5@h as a response, you know trump queen is out|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla has a very good technique always|pg||
nt|chick: I do, just because there are so many chances to make, with only one way to go down|pg||
mc|7|nt|josj: on her way to 14 more imps...|pg||
nt|eleni: Judith likes to duck her Aces|pg||
nt|richie: 13 imps to Poland, 4@h went 2 down in Open room|pg||

nt|loe48: then 3c-3d|pg||
nt|richie: yes, look at the other matches: Poland will play Italy, Netherlands, France and Netherlands will play France, Poland Sweden |pg||
nt|bebechira: i play some sort of multi|pg||
nt|richie: you can say whatever you want, but it's not boring|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky not doubled|pg||
nt|doks: so we have allmost level at this match|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i didnt like the bidding sequence but good judgement in the end to push to 6@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N makes here and 4@s didn't in CR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Or the explantion of a bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 2@H Muiderberg|pg||
nt|zebutin: partner opens and you have 24hcp...seems good?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for Danish supporters. Denmark were 0-25 down after 4 boards, now the scoreline reads 33-25|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: EW make lots of tricks in C|pg||
nt|chick: I think they can make 5@C with some crossruffing|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are on brd 10 and the closed is on brd 7|pg||
nt|richie: east has only 9HCP but great values and a void, it's enough to open 1@s|pg||
nt|atalok: geçen elin moral bozuklugu ile burdada forsingmiydi oynamak içinmiydi karýþmýþ|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: uff wat a match :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: against Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: i vugraphed Ron-Lotan in Philadelphia and they drove me crazy... the slowest juniors ever|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pikowy zabójczy na 5 karo|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Tuczek - tylko spokojnie proszê|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mariasz kier ci siê "marnuje" |pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||
nt|loe48: med 2 langfarver so i den 6nt de meldte her er beste kontrakt alltid  6nt..for det er nok en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
nt|doks: if I remember correctly, this is of city in NED|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h seems makeable|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Will they duck grand now?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Is he good enough for 5C?|pg||
nt|richie: now he tells partner about the good fit and shortness in @c|pg||
nt|psyck: very swingy boards this set indeed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 big boards have bought Podda into the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
nt|chick: the @D bid makes his singleton worth more (less chance partner has wasted values there)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E may save the day|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Lotan player with bar taranovski in phili|pg||
nt|eliran_a: played|pg||
nt|eliran_a: but they are still slow|pg||
nt|zebutin: diamonds behave so 7 makes...but not exactly best contract|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿na wytrfzymaæ|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead was needed, not easy to lead singles in NT  :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: decisive deal here :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
nt|antoniz: Witam serdecznie|pg||
nt|doks: 2M promises 5M and 4+ in any minor weaker than normal opening|pg||
nt|chick: 5 clubs to the Q and a major suit Q are all he needs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-W in other room Rimstedt are twins and for me at least it is impossible to see who is who:D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 8, no slam in OR either.|pg||

nt|kemperg: S must no its a misfit for him, p has 4 or 5 @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass good|pg||
nt|richie: I believe you have to do too much work in 6@s, unless North leads @dK there is a chance|pg||
nt|atalok: burdaki 2 D 4.renk yerine kullanýlýyor|pg||
nt|atalok: klasikte 2 cl der gibi|pg||
nt|bobholl: exactly not :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  7@h is better|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, 7@H might even make to decentish...or closer to it :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: and good morning to Bob too :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H T is not easy to find :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So Drivjer mada an light openingin board 8 so they are in 2@d dbl|pg||
nt|bobholl: in the bidding|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wrrrrrrrrr|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 3@d i think is forcing...|pg||
nt|richie: what happened here? doesn't west have a normal 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: you want to help here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||
nt|richie: hi everyone|pg||

nt|rnmalik: can count upto 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: I hope so :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ok|pg||
nt|chick: 4@D down one but he has to do the hearts right for that|pg||
nt|richie: 5@c is an overbid IMO - after the splinter 4@h tells your hand enough|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bebechira: thu we have 17.18, fri 19.20 and sat 21 isn't it?|pg||

nt|eliran_a: nice stop |pg||
nt|runnerup: and in that number 7 -west bid 2@c with that hand -which was 1nt here -so they never found any big ns -300 but not enought -so listen to Richie 1nt with such hand|pg||

nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith rebid 1nt on the same auction|pg||

nt|richie: this can go 3 down with maximum defence|pg||
nt|chick: @H10 right now|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Duck and give partner H ruff still beats it 2|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H 10 you could try to raise @S, without it might try for @H even & @D not more than 4-2, or @H 4-2 and @D 3-3/J10 doubleton... or something like that...|pg||

mb|p|nt|timve:  but with @HQx even 6NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: club ten would've scored 11|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile France is knocking on the door for bronze|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in open should also go down 2 or 3, so maybe the damage is minimal|pg||
nt|doks: ok at the half stage low scooring tie|pg||
nt|zebutin: that might be realistic :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: entries are problem though|pg||
nt|loe48: paa spill 8 antar jeg at gutta tar noen imp hjem igjen|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR 3@CW|pg||

nt|marionmi:  on the last hand, i might have made a gametry showing 5crd@h with east|pg||
nt|andyv:  so they slipped...only 12 imps on this board|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@h here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  let's see if this 1nt opening by madala preempts ew out of 4@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|loe48: fordi det er ikke noe reell 4h melding|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s for NS should be OK here despite the bad breaks in @S and @c|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and i would also have overcalled with north|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  5@c in open room here|pg||

nt|bebechira: Italy have 10 boards to find some imps.... they need a big win|pg||
mb|2H|nt|murat e: undo|pg||
nt|runnerup: if clubs found -thre migth be no @h loose -@H lead and it leds 3@c to make|pg||
nt|henryb:  A strange choice of response; that should normally have four trumps|pg||
nt|oosb: easy 3NT bid for North now|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s here not more|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland is the second last match|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith has 6 tricks already|pg||

nt|bebechira: only 7 vps between 2nd and 4th|pg||
nt|richie: yes, incredible exciting!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 6 it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c leads would seem to scuttle 5@c|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: birman was trap passing|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankbo: ja 6 hj står enkelt|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: sorry, but I seem to have connection problems, so comments may appear unconnected|pg||
nt|uttam: i dont like 1@h o/c|pg||
nt|oosb: not the worst I've seen|pg||
nt|oosb: so it's ok for me|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure, who likes it, but sometimes you just get in there|pg||
nt|oosb: East thinking about his lead.|pg||
nt|uttam: sorry folks i have lost electricity, can hold max for another 5mts|pg||
nt|richie: yes|pg||
nt|doks: in open room after 2@C opening bidding goes easy looking|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: nooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: is this the hand we are watching|pg||
nt|murat e: hand is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: there is something wrong, because players card are difference to bbo|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes that was expected|pg||
nt|galois85: good morning everybody, hi fabio!|pg||
nt|ntmon: declarer has to her tricks somewhere and could not be sure about @C position|pg||
nt|spenny80: ciao Andrea!|pg||
nt|ntmon: it doesn't look a coffee board for her|pg||
nt|eleni: @h buongiorno Andrea|pg||
nt|bebechira: France,Poland, Sweden for the dutch girls....not easy|pg||
nt|bebechira: the open room settled in 6|pg||
nt|iceblue: its hard after 3@H|pg||
nt|richie: sweden is still 3rd but cannot afford too many bad boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  but @d has to be lead somewhere so may have more play than first glance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No 3NT now it appears|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Padon thought that partner had a long @s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  As a youngsters u dont want to miss a grand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|loe48: er mulig N proever naa, han vet makker sitter med tynn aapner|pg||
nt|oosb: A concept that might be hard to grasp for people not from our subcontinent, uttam :) = no electricity|pg||
nt|timve:  so you can use puppet and jacoby|pg||
nt|richie: lol|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=4@S+ and 1@S=3 cards I belive.|pg||
nt|richie: I think so too|pg||
nt|doks: here 1st 5 bids same as open room|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: very surprising|pg||
nt|kemperg: terrible:(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  this will also make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: I understand him|pg||
nt|frankbo: hadde blitt vanskelig for Ø med 3 hj fra S|pg||
nt|timve:  this pair has a better solution|pg||
nt|timve:  they use Kokish|pg||
nt|timve:  2@H is natural or very strong NT|pg||
nt|spenny80: no, She can play @h finess or @s expass|pg||
nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With AK@h and a normal @c shift |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess so but in this situation i prefer lebensohl :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: lankweld was mercifull and didn't x|pg||
nt|bobholl: misunderstanding :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That does not beat it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|doks: N still looking for 7 if 2@D dont deny 4controls|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@S was a difficult bid to read safer to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: preempt worked in both rooms.. but|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S7 best now|pg||
nt|kemperg: but thats loses the controle, @C then for defenders|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
nt|bebechira: still 2 vps in front|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H must be cue, with shortness, as he deny @H support|pg||
nt|doks: but they must know better their aggreements|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E trying to force rather than going for ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|richie: sweden 155, france 153, italy 149 (maybe they are the 3rd dog coming for the bone?)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No u right |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He then set up the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for N,, he wants to lead @d and @c at same time|pg||
nt|atalok: bu çift 4.rengi klasik oynuyorlar |pg||
pc|h8|nt|loe48: ja er muligheter her|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3s-4d now|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||
nt|richie: seems to be a push, same contract reached|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  trying to pull trumphs :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3-3 @s will see this one home|pg||
nt|doks: specs suggest 4@H kick-back RKC|pg||
pc|s3|nt|loe48: naar trump er avtalt er det bare aa starte quebids lavest mulig|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|josj: grazie :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR S opened 2@S W 4@H end|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: just play and be done with it, it's not like you can make in some miraculous lie of the cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Oh dear|pg||
nt|doks: but then I try count answers, and I'm confused a little|pg||
pc|c7|nt|_fonzie__:  the 2@s bid was a little too timid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|loe48: saa 3s ville vaere q naa|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 sp blir 4. farge|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 3NT fra N|pg||
nt|loe48: ikke i dette meldingsforloepet|pg||
nt|rodal f: Etter revers fra N? Da kutte eg 4th color.|pg||
nt|frankbo: N vet ikke om H tilpassningen enda|pg||
nt|loe48: er helt greit med 3h-4h mener jeg|pg||
nt|richie: 2 VPs is nothing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass always at team then Frank.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: So some national Polich players have left the Polich club it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke did not see the danger|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bebechira: Rosaline in 5d dbled in the closed|pg||
nt|doks: and A ask more frequently use strong hand rather than weak|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richie: 500 and 1 imp to france I guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2 imps|pg||
nt|richie: might be a swing to france again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't ruff 2 diamonds if they play another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he should have realised that and played on spades|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ouch to fast play here from his side|pg||
nt|richie: only  hope for Padon was the singleton honour in @s|pg||
nt|bebechira: Massimilliano in 5d in brd 9 so that will be flat|pg||
nt|eliran_a: good lead by delle cave , club lead give and the contract makes ,declerer needs to play J@c from dummy |pg||
pc|s5|nt|bebechira: may be 2|pg||
nt|chick: good forcing technique, duck until win dummy's last trump|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mrdct: unblock the @dA and then keep drawing trumps|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: well I have electricity, but it is not working too well..|pg||
nt|bcmandal: if rkc 5c means?|pg||
nt|doks: another suggestion from speecs, Optional kick-back, with 4@S min, than its ok with answers|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|asig: Now declarer "just" needs to get the spades right|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: oops|pg||
pc|d2|nt|2hplus4: Declarer squandered chances of dummy entries|pg||
nt|chick: well, he got his small trump after all|pg||
mc|12|nt|timve:  if you find your 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|richie: good attempt, but won't succeed as north has the @hT with the free @sQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause KQ -doubleton ok too 2@h and 1 @s|pg||

nt|vugraphpl5: sorry for this situation|pg||
nt|murat e: this type of hand difficult to evaluate make souths spade one more club one less and slam is on with a normal 3-2 trump break|pg||

nt|ntmon: such a splendid outcome ..|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||
nt|richie: partscore in @h probably|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: does anyone knows the NS sys? is this 4@Ss+5minor?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: thanks to all the kibitzers who confirmed|pg||
nt|offthebend: if Kiran responds to @D opening , they will go Minus in 2NT on C 10 lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: we need some action here now|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Asia Krawczyk Taczewska: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=29688|pg||
nt|richie: aha, no, east can open 1NT first - will be playing 2@s|pg||
nt|doks: normal 2@H, must be duplicated here as well|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not?|pg||
nt|runnerup: some douthloking values in east but 4@h must be didden and makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
nt|richie: everyone passing? maybe 1@s - 2@c pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
nt|kemperg: I do, but dont see it much|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a push board , 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
nt|atalok: þimdide 12 de  10|pg||
nt|zebutin: N opening, most likely last contract seem to be 3nt...@C A favorably positioned|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  very aggressive 3d hand opener now, with a very poor club suit too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
nt|chick: yes, preempt bids are based on length and the Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess 2N is a @H raise, though I don't understand why not 2@S|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  me to :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
nt|chick: that's why making a weak 2 bid with a 7 card suit is silly|pg||
nt|chick: and why opening 4@S with a 7 card suit is dangerous|pg||

nt|andreasw:  3nt here?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT! that's again modest|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: kib suggests he's afraid of it being passed |pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: non @H lead NS can make 3NT, am I right?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: since last board understandeble:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no try a @c lead:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after second duck i think W will find the shift:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: anyway, this should make comfortably, and a small gain for israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  this will be hard to defeat|pg||
mb|p|nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the right plan was to ruff 2 @d and 2@s before pulling the trumphs and then palyed a@hJ and N was endplayed (from Johan Upmark)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  particial in @D is the spot contract here i think... unless 4@S it might make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't think your rigid views are mainstream|pg||
pc|dK|nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
nt|atalok: polish atak|pg||
nt|atalok: 94 den 4 atak ediyorlar þimdi mecburen ortadan atak ediyor |pg||
pc|d4|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
nt|doks: Must leave right now. Big thanks for excellent company and valuable contribution from specs, was pleasure|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here 2@h was 8-11|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  kibs asks what one should lead after X, which is a very interesting question|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  it looks like the normal lead without a double would be spades and one doesnt double on a 3rd hand opener by partner for a normal lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|s8|nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
nt|chick: but they are based in good theory and work ...whether or not people use that theory correctly is up to them|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|_fonzie__:  so definitely not spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  One should ask for unblock or count, the other for attitude|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman gonna play with the odds @d to k @d to A and a @d to the J |pg||
nt|bobholl: it is his only chance so :) |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|frankbo: det tror jeg lars fikk en gavepakke|pg||
nt|rodal f: GEO sin melding på B11 ville vert 4@D=2 nøkkelkort+trumfQ. @H|pg||
nt|frankbo: kl så er han vel trumfmatt|pg||
nt|loe48: har vi noe sluttkontrakt i spill 9?|pg||
nt|frankbo: nei|pg||
nt|josj: is 6@C such a bad proposition if @H are 4-3?|pg||
nt|offthebend: another imp coming up for NS |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|loe48: draw spades and dia..look for an opening|pg||

nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: well I'm sure N will feel better that his bid was endorsed by the LOTT :)|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  diamonds can defeat it too by for instance cashing 4 tricks and then playing clubs, waiting for the king of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A board for Rana Avis Frank?|pg||
nt|loe48: well done Johansen!|pg||
nt|josj: a good saved available here for EW, even vul.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you make 2 suiter with E?|pg||
nt|richie: ladies and gentlemen, another wild hand!|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT would be @d+@h, perfect hand for it :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  heheh yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|spenny80: bid|pg||
nt|josj: if Margherita can take action now...|pg||
nt|ntmon: surely worth it|pg||
nt|spenny80: seeing that, I feel old|pg||
nt|josj: what about me?|pg||
nt|josj: at mp  it would be different|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think she will|pg||
nt|marionmi:  then 3@s-5@d?|pg||
nt|richie: that would shut out NS bidding completely |pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, 1@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 nt in open room |pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Another example of a pushy dbl|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes, but isn't mp|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's easier to adapt your bidding methods than give away your years |pg||
nt|mrdct: some goods 10s and 9s|pg||
nt|richie: horrible hands!! they open multi and EW face these hands... |pg||
nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky this time, happens, but EW had a 6@D slam too|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 13|pg||
nt|eliran_a: undo sir|pg||
nt|bebechira: KD lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||
nt|marionmi:  into doubling them?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer X with all points outside|pg||
nt|chick: by the way, the LoTT for preempts assumes that partner has his fair share of the remaining cards in the suit.  In that hand, it didn't happen|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Then does the LOTT not work if partner does not do his bit by contributing a massive dummy? :)|pg||
nt|chick: massive not required, two spades would have helped a lot|pg||
mb|3N|nt|spenny80: in other room netherlands girl think as me|pg||
nt|ntmon: may die out at 5@S|pg||
nt|richie: well bid |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 tricks :(|pg||
nt|richie: 6 or even 7@d is making, you need to rebid @ds for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: hehe|pg||
nt|oosb: But then again, I'm never opening this 1@C|pg||
nt|josj: should not be too difficult to locate @CQ|pg||
nt|josj: E will be known to hold 5-5-2-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 2 suiter in est and seeing 2@s in E, Q@c can't pay|pg||
nt|josj: but 6@D is still OK|pg||
nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||
nt|richie: then you should pass again|pg||
nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I like 1@H ni the other room more than I like 2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In copen room Lothan said pass|pg||
nt|atalok: en sevdigim deklerasyon eski günlerdeki gibi.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this will be an easy board:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10 in OR E was the declarer in 3NT and made on Q@D lead and Sweden gained 12 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s minus 7 I am told, so 7 imps to France   Crazy match...|pg||
nt|richie: take it or leave it|pg||
nt|marionmi:  4d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|antoniz: czas na pass|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  the 11HCP opener didnt work out well at all, as it kept ns out of 4@h which has no chance at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3 times @c gives defence a chance|pg||
nt|loe48: et pent spill|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 spade is a tranfer response|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT by EW likely contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: tes 3 tricks scored.... you hoped for 6|pg||
nt|bebechira: new leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Antoni jak rymujesz to w jednym jêzyku proszê:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this takes care of the @c loser|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: B9 Netherland picked up a new 6IMPer. Norway need to fight well now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
nt|antoniz: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||
nt|spenny80: but here is the same|pg||
nt|spenny80: normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably the same outcome if south did open|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Its only Swe and Austria who stoped at 6 Nt and lost 13imps on board 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
nt|richie: north never showed her extra values, 3NT will be the end|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  as g_milito points out, it can be made after a club lead (cash 3 rounds of clubs, spade to the jack)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||
nt|murat e: some spec suggests 2 dia instead of 2 sp but matchpoint bidding is not that way|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @S is best |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And now padon has takaway NS suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 1 too much |pg||
pc|h6|nt|timve:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|timve:  if declarer takes in her hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: good lead|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal bid of 3@s by west and a good lead by north whice means the contract gonna fail by 1 trick|pg||
nt|atalok: batý ilk cl i alýnca H dönüþünü bulursa batýrýr|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you open this ligth you always have to be carefull|pg||
nt|zebutin: and once has been bid only fullgame on that...so even juniors can know restraint...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||
nt|richie: but 6@d makes and would therefore be a good sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|timve:  and takes a heart finesse|pg||
nt|antoniz: z rêk¹ N mo¿na sobie Staymana darowaæ|pg||

nt|loe48: en ting er aa see det herfra..en annen ting er aa fysisk gjoere det|pg||
nt|richie: nicely done|pg||
nt|bobholl: safetyplay in @H ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ryskiel_: In Italy spades are like cross|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 6 nt in open room here so a flat one|pg||
pc|c4|nt|asig: A chance to hold the contract to 10 tricks, that is :)|pg||
nt|richie: DBL probably asking for an unusual lead, but they did not discuss this together|pg||
nt|offthebend: it has been a VERY low scoring match -  both teams have played tight bridge and both have made 2-3 errors each |pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||
nt|bebechira: you went quiet Richard ?|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in the meanwhile makes comfortably|pg||
nt|marionmi:  still down on a heart return|pg||
nt|richie: @dQ on the K :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c pitch seems automatic, whether W can ruff or not|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mrdct: no reason to not continue with what partner lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  now W has a @c to exit with|pg||
nt|rnmalik: first the @C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: i wd appreciate 4@S by W - showing some offensive extras |pg||
nt|spenny80: 1@d pass 1@h pas pas 1NT.....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|richie: Q is an alarming card, 9 still too vague|pg||
nt|marionmi:  spangenberg wont think her partner has 5 diamonds, so i think she should play the queen to show something weird is going on|pg||
nt|marionmi:  9 might also be neutral from Q9x|pg||
nt|richie: unlucky @c break dooms the contract|pg||
nt|rensph: 3@D will probably make, will be a big win for France with the sharp 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|bobholl: no in @C now :)|pg||

nt|spenny80: how possible?|pg||
nt|josj: don't think so :(|pg||
nt|richie: you still need to switch to spades for -2, maybe declarer had to put @dA singleton?|pg||
nt|runnerup: how did he manage in that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: but well done to make 1N here|pg||
nt|bebechira: France having a missunderstanding in the closed |pg||
nt|rensph: difference of only 1 imp though, with the result from the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: he had very good chances|pg||
nt|atalok: abarasyon sayamadý karolarý yapacak bi þey yok|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: E in 4s at the moment|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep... a push|pg||

nt|offthebend: this board I had mentioned earlier where formidables have overshot to 6H |pg||
mb|1S|nt|oosb: 2NT showing @H + @D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, I am not sure 2N says hearts...|pg||
nt|spenny80: ok correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s not a ridiculous spot here|pg||
nt|richie: Poland doing extremely well, even scoring big numbers against the top countries|pg||
nt|andyv:  marginal opener for S|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 1NT is supposedly 15-17, I don't particulaly like this upgrade|pg||
nt|runnerup: with spades 4-2 and hearts 2-2- should have been easy,but who am i to say ..|pg||
nt|eliran_a: maybe after this opening lead by madala his partner will push for a small slam in @c whice fails only in @s lead|pg||
nt|eliran_a: opening bid *|pg||
nt|bobholl: how to bid 4@S ?|pg||
nt|zebutin: again 4@S for N/S...can they bid this one, good distribution but not too many points|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@s e-w here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: also 3 nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 to go|pg||
nt|bebechira: dbl now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but they would have ended up in 3N anyway|pg||
nt|offthebend: Kamal under pressure |pg||
mb|2S|nt|spenny80: 3@d by north would be better (lead direction)|pg||
nt|galois85: 3nt e-w here?|pg||
nt|josj: easy make :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult|pg||
nt|richie: yes, clear penalty dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  may still get to 4@h|pg||
nt|atalok: bunlar daha 19-20 yaþýnda çocuklar yrtdýþýnda BBO da heyecan normaldir|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H fit bid ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B11. Same open same X but S bidded 3@H where S passed here. 3@S came and pass around.|pg||
nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
nt|richie: that's sad for them, two bad boards in a row doesn't give much confidence|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@D lead:)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||
nt|murat e: no risk no fun|pg||
nt|timve:  wow|pg||
nt|timve:  this is excitement (and not only in the tour de France)|pg||
nt|timve:  this is two off with the good lead|pg||
nt|timve:  but 6@S has also a chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not a friendly layout in @d today|pg||
nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||
nt|richie: again unlucky breaks, but NS should be able to stop in 2@h/2NT here - south should just bid 1NT and deny 3@h with these good spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c drury|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be...which isnt too good for N... |pg||
nt|zebutin: 2nt maybe mixed raise?|pg||
nt|offthebend: so a small loss and match will be almost EVEN after first set |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||
nt|bebechira: lovely Sigrid did not want to penalize North|pg||
nt|richie: lol:)|pg||
nt|richie: it's not even down that much after a (normal) spade lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||
nt|marionmi:  "small" accident happened on the last board|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 more imps for Sweden and in the 18-12 teritory now|pg||
nt|richie: nearly 19-11   it shouldn't get any worse for the Dutch if they want to secure the silver medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Chicken - or?|pg||
nt|frankbo: da var de for høyt|pg||
nt|bebechira: E in 5h at the moment|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT denies 3@s so 3@c is not needed|pg||
nt|bobholl: after the unusual NT yes @D K :(|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2nt not lebensohl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: 5@c is also making|pg||
nt|spenny80: urca|pg||
nt|spenny80: aggressive bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room ..things are..lets say...much more...agressive|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they settled in 2s by east undoubled|pg||
nt|2hplus4: nice competition|pg||
nt|kemperg: 45 Kleinmann points thats an upgrade|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: might make 3@D 3@C 2@H and 1@S, or 1@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: btu this definitely won't be easy to play|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D now|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4@D sorry, missed the Qxx|pg||
nt|runnerup: declarer never raised @s high in that 6 @h -but rossruffed for down 2|pg||
nt|bobholl: well/lucky done :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  good lead|pg||
nt|timve:  now its-2|pg||
nt|mrdct: presure on the opening lead now|pg||
nt|antoniz: 4NT rozumiem jako reka 6tr i 4-y kara,partnerze wybierz|pg||
nt|bebechira: they have to score 10 VPs isn't it?|pg||
nt|richie: what to lead in east? passive diamond = OK|pg||
nt|richie: yes|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So this is a good 3Nt|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: much easier then, 4@D 3@C and 1 of each major|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if pushed then support & inv... don't know :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth be indeed :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT for minors.|pg||
nt|offthebend: thank you all -- will see you all later - I may be playing the next set |pg||
pc|d2|nt|timve:  and 300 is a reasonalbe result|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N may ask for place S would accept a game try|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  dangerous bid from madala|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Flott press fra N. Ikke enkelt detta.|pg||
nt|oosb: and well done by EW to win the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  first|pg||
pc|d9|nt|murat e: brave man|pg||
nt|richie: lol... |pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has to switch to a @d to set the contract (at least not spade)|pg||
nt|bebechira: i just typed ...diamond 2 now|pg||
nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: North in 4h in the open room...|pg||
nt|rensph: Operator, could you check result for board 12 after play?|pg||
nt|chick: N likes the second fit, but he should worry about too many heart losers when hearts is not supported by E|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It appears it was not just competition|pg||
nt|suketbombi: vow:):)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|loe48: ikke enkelt..gaar mot 1 ned i denne|pg||
nt|frankbo: eneste sjansen er x sp fra bordet og at N bruker K|pg||
nt|rodal f: Info. CET13.00 Holland against, live as I'm told so fare. Not 100% shure.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norway.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit "Møllers Tran" from bough sides.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, must be|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems like only 3 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Lunch break after this hand,  we will be back at 3.00pm IST|pg||
pc|c3|nt|asig: North can't prevent the fourth diamond from being ruffed - his clubs are too small|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 of @c makes a ruff j and 9 both in south true|pg||
nt|bebechira: good contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 diamonds and spade to give ...probably|pg||
nt|bebechira: well done|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h can only be made by gods, let's see if she is one :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h on S hand in open room with a spade lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: Italy made 4s for 10 very needed imps on brd 11|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  Looks better - who would lead the 2 from the Jack?|pg||
nt|loe48: korrekt spill her er liten spar mot J|pg||
nt|oosb: NS making LOTS of tricks in @C or @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: karo Asiu karo!!!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i trefle na dodatkow¹ szansê|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|galois85: not at all... but as you said before, we are not juniores!|pg||
nt|josj: any more|pg||
nt|mrdct: communications are a big problem here for declarer|pg||
nt|richie: this is also clever :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Rosaline club queen lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will try to ruff one @s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: still, might try @Hs instead of @Cs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 more imps to Ned on board 11|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  I don't know how anyone could stay OUT of 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: i could come up many sequences where people could stay out... void @H vs. Kxxxx in hearts isn't exactly best...|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  yes, and game still makes...so maybe they all those people shouldnt worry so much|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One more round to-day|pg||
nt|murat e: 520 beats this one if any...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You might see the lead in board 14 this way: Chance for more than 1 trick = @C-lead|pg||
nt|oosb: North should not have passed.|pg||
nt|oosb: Stuck for a bid I wouldve chosen 3@C|pg||
nt|oosb: Or dbl.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  with everything behaving, should make 5@h|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman needs to find the @s lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: now clubs in that hand that @s lead comes easyer |pg||
nt|ejotaese: ç|pg||
nt|eliran_a: as i know alon we can go for 10 min breat until he is leading|pg||
nt|eliran_a: break*|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: time for coffeee|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: will need to set up diamonds after trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: how to play @C|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes ha had several choises here|pg||
nt|eliran_a: suprise|pg||
nt|runnerup: i am not aware about this system ,but 4 @h may indicate @c and try..ok -now has to guess @h|pg||
nt|eliran_a: action now , birman should not raise with the h!k when N plays @H from hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: if decl..doent guess @h -he is off because no squeze exist|pg||
pc|c9|nt|timve:  well defended|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@H was a good call, making EW to guess|pg||
nt|spenny80: you need 6@c and @s finess to make 3NT.... a lot|pg||
nt|richie: y|pg||
nt|richie: but gave 2 tricks back at once again by playing @H to T|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: nice duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: my P and i would bid 1@S X 2@H (sound 2@S) 3@H shortsuit trial 3@S and stay out :(|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, it makes in this hand.... :) but does it make most of the time with those sequences or not...thats the more important question, not what happens just this time :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  If my partner said "Sound 2@S" on that I would probably bid 4 anyway as Norht & shoot him later for underbidding|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: AK good in most cases|pg||
pc|dK|nt|loe48: hvis N stikker med honoer dra J neste gang for a tippe K10 eller Q10 bak|pg||
nt|bebechira: e in 5h in the closed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dan_ehh: @D queen doesn't give declarer anything that isn't his already|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  my thought to|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: except the info that south had to lead from Qxx which means he didn't have anything more attractive|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so there is a clue about the hearts then|pg||
nt|eliran_a: game over|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and nice lead by wouter van den hove, diamond could have gone on a spade otherwise|pg||
pc|c6|nt|josj: after 3@H there is  no way to find out|pg||
nt|gregpog:  nie uslyszala :(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze ¿e przed parti¹|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|asig: But 3NT surely more desireable|pg||

nt|atalok: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=891|pg||
nt|zebutin: and blame him for bidding "Sound 2@S" if it doesn't make? :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: she will be able to establish a long @d but the defence will surely find their @c before she does so|pg||
nt|spenny80: W can play a 4th round in @h... I hope no|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry red suits ..yes makes even then ..so opening lead was critical|pg||
nt|eliran_a: nicely played by delle dave !|pg||
nt|eliran_a: cave |pg||
nt|bobholl: Q@H @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: in 13|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman was not ready for the @h play coming|pg||
nt|vincenzo1: wds (well done son .... lol !)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and he cant thinks too much , should play immidiattley small|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bebechira: East is bringing 2 s home in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: so imps for the french girls|pg||
nt|richie: east should now be able to count that partner has @cA and play @cQ|pg||
nt|richie: declarer can now take her diamonds and endplay west|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... lets see|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  That is a sound 3@S limit, so if it doesn't make I will just shrug|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: We will be back in 15 min...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 NS i 6@H. Samme som her|pg||

nt|andreasw:  did not matter if @h Q or small back|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|spenny80: and if in W bid 3Nt looks like show 4@s (otherwise you have bid 3NT before) |pg||
nt|mrdct: best to cut her losses now and cash out the @s suit - otherwise many down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|richie: it has been a long and mentally tiring tournament, it's difficult for the players to keep up with the good level and see these kinds of endplays|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oosb: And as one of the kibz points out, South couldve dbled 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now he must duck a @s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  If S plays another @h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|spenny80: wait...|pg||
nt|chick: playing for a doubleton @D honor and a defense mistake|pg||
nt|2hplus4: He could have played for doubleton the other way|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: must read the cards correctly, very difficult|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And Still Birman cant play on @c|pg||

nt|oosb: 6@C cold|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ryskiel_: brawo dziewczyny|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe @C ace and another|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but that won't work if south has the @S ace|pg||
nt|kemperg: only @SQ is wrong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But remember that N has ducked once in spades|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: yes, excellent duck, but Birman is very experienced, might still read it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Normally it tends to be S as favorite to have it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|josj: wy not play@C immediately? gives the def. a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|kemperg: @DQ gives the show away, can t have @SA|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: why not?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andreasw:  squezze now  tho?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  S has to hold @c 10x|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dan_ehh: the question is whether A9x KQxxx Qxx Jx is a @H overcall after 1N|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but I wouldn't|pg||
nt|kemperg: oh no, forgot the king|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  I know loser-count is a trad old fashioned but 5 losers opposite 8 losers - there shouldn't really be much discussion|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
