mc|13|nt|henryb:  So E-W are playing some sort of forcing pass?|pg||
nt|psyck: Right, 0-7 or 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Sweden they have the 'dot' procedure regarding which systems and conventions you are alloowed to play. You are only allowed a certain number of 'dots'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't remember how many, 10 maybe?|pg||
nt|psyck: If they have more, they play connect the dots|pg||
nt|petka: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: varies depending on competition I am told|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Alenfalk-Kvick have with them a written defence against strong pass :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many 'dots' allowed at MP, Peter?|pg||
nt|petka: 8 I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: Giving rise to the wide-spread belief that bridge players are dotty?|pg||
nt|petka: 10+ is only allowed when you play at "gold" level at least 8 consecutive boards or something liek that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many are snotty|pg||
nt|petka: a forcing pass in itself is 0 dots|pg||
pg||

nt|psyck: Only if they stick to the dotted line|pg||
nt|petka: but "dark" bids (eg: no specific suit, might be unbalanced) are 2 dots, with extra dots for 1M if I remember correctly, and extra dots if they might be <8 HCP|pg||
nt|henryb:  Involves transfer openings|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|petka: "pointer" bids, such as transfers, are 1 dot for suit pointers and 2 dots for NT pointers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Interesting|pg||
nt|petka: so that is usually not a problem, it is the dark, weak bids such as 2D multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka: that is 3 dots right there (2 for the dark thing, 1 extra for might be <8 HCP)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  and lots of transfer responses and relays|pg||
nt|petka: 1M dark and weak is 5 dots or something|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, flattish, some may be -2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, specs correctly point out that this gave an unnecessary 8th trick... s could switch to the @h after winning the @d.|pg||
nt|petka: Well, since E has 18 HCP, it depends on wests reply to a 1D opening. If it is 1N I believe the result will be copied, but a diamond raise will probably lead to -2 as many point out|pg||
nt|jbennet: if bidding goes 1 d- 3 D east do not bid 3 NT but 3 sp (anonymous bidding is hugely overrated)|pg||
nt|petka: playing strong club bidding will often go p-1C-1H-1N and -2 again|pg||
nt|petka: not many pairs have a system to avoid bidding NT with weak doubleton when holding the 18-19NT variety|pg||
