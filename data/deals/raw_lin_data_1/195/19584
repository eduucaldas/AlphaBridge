mb|p|mb|d|nt|andyv:  this hand easy to play from here...at the table, N will have problems|pg||

nt|panosk: what do you think about double as t/o from E straight after 3@C?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS almost make 3N on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I prefer 3 @S,  not resulting,  but I do not have 4 @H's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ideal Panos, says I have @H + @D + tolerance for @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  if they played ELC, then N was on track to do just that (show the 2 suits)|pg||
nt|kemperg: you are doiing fine:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed to make the contract but timing of suit play  has to be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E only has 6 pts |pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: duck and it goes of it own>)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that the X doesnt promise a bit more |pg||
nt|sybarra: from E |pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: N's @S holding means S is not going to convert a X - and N not going to sit for @C's - so what is the point of X rather than a 2-suited bid that would surely slow S down?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dealing with todays preempts means you sometimes have to lower the point requirements|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|panosk: tough call i have no positive answer either|pg||
nt|sybarra: from my point of view,  the X would include k of @H's for example|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont think its enough for a X |pg||
nt|sybarra: now, if playing neg frees,  perhaps he bids 3 @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe with spade tolerance he can bid 3 @D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but that cuts the possible @H fit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Something like what happened seems relatively foreseeable.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will have to be careful here not to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
