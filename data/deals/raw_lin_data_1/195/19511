nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||

pc|dK|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||

pc|h2|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||

nt|rnmalik: or @D Ace.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h needs finess only about so near 50%|pg||
nt|bebechira: the twins in 4h in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|3H|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||

nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
nt|serhat: on a D lead 4H can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

pc|s4|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
nt|pinticus: 4@s OR EW|pg||

nt|garden2005: dobry wieczór wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|le joker: @c lead go down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||
nt|sybarra: ideal bid would be 4 @D as cue and spade raise, (on the way to game) |pg||
nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||
nt|riccho:  dont understand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||
nt|sybarra: record would have fallen Richard|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is a useful convention here: XX here from E would show doubt about the contract |pg||
nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||
nt|daman: win the @C and play the @S 10|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  2 down again |pg||
nt|loe48: well. as we see this contract has no chanse as both sides overbid their hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: 1 h, 2 d and 1c looks obvious|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If E plays @DK first then 6.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|psyck: this defense makes it easy for declarer, not there there was much defense could do|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|yuval10: her name, by the way, is "Petersen"...as "Irma Petersen"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yuval10: the Pedersen's are on the other side of the border, in Denmark|pg||

nt|sybarra: very instructive,  both E open 1 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not some crazy preempt |pg||
mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: ewentualnie NS w obrone|pg||
nt|eugenio123: were they swopping? lol    at the end 10 tricks|pg||
nt|saverio: 4@s for NS here|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly it is just one of those magic hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h must show  values and a super @d-fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he bid 1 nt, (2 suited presumably)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: that why I would be nervous |pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may play 4 sp |pg||
nt|bebechira: south has a hand to double some  high contract for sure|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lotte will bid 5c and the double will come.... but not enough to match 910|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they make +1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question is did W promise 5 @S? |pg||
nt|bobholl: just losing 1@S and 1C not that difficult|pg||
nt|jkotor: absurdalne 1BA IMO|pg||
nt|jkotor: oba stare i 18|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eugenio123: 2@s show 5@h gf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should have overcalled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 10 tricks ye|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C should make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's hard to bid game|pg||
nt|sybarra: need great agreements for that bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: fit bid?|pg||
nt|frankbo: well u need D 3-3 to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 5?|pg||
nt|le joker: xD|pg||

nt|frankbo: 7NT|pg||
nt|le joker: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|loe48: this hand again is almost to good for a weak 2 opener, rather 1s-2s hand|pg||
nt|saverio: since they bid usually 1 or 2 tricks more it shouldnt be difficult for them to get there :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to click pass....but i should :(|pg||

nt|daman: this seems like a routine contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C X can go down by @C lead and duck the @S 2 times|pg||
nt|bebechira: another coffee hand... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yuval10: and it looks natural to lead @d from N in that bidding|pg||

nt|bebechira: clubs behave so easy 9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|timverbeek:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  back to 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: not so easy now...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: but declarer will finesse the J@h and the @h's are 3-3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|timverbeek:  hard for east to decide|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  interesting lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: EW maybe push them to bid game|pg||
nt|eugenio123: finally they found their fit on 4th level|pg||

pc|h7|nt|psyck: he knows @h44 now if @h7 lead was 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: szalay is there |pg||
nt|veistikke:  6 is :P|pg||
pc|hT|nt|timverbeek:  now declarer is in big danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 9 was the winning play |pg||
nt|riccho:  sounded like him|pg||
nt|jkotor: Zobaczymy, czy S nie bêdzie "nasiniêty" i czy 9 karo co nie nam¹ci|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: they needed to double hook the @H to make    |pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|sybarra: what I told, the 3 @S showed wk spades,  but my question is why not support hts? |pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: in deep thought |pg||
nt|suketbombi: but the tarrif is Low NV|pg||
nt|panja: wide range opening, so if East passes 1@D, he risks losing a good game opposite a strong hand...say 18-21 with some distribution...but if he bids 1@H....the risk is overbid part|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes screens there|pg||

nt|yuval10: per match|pg||

nt|bebechira: and after +400 a smile will come up on his face... |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
nt|loe48: open 1h helped opponents to win 4s|pg||

nt|eugenio123: I suggest 2@h by south|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3karo|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
nt|veistikke:  got a feeling of 3!nt inn S|pg||
nt|jkotor: sporo kart w starych|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale 1@d wykluczam, tam jest mo¿e 8-9 PC|pg||
nt|serhat: N should bid definately last hand. dbl or 4h both fine for me as he has D tolerans|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
nt|jkotor: a co s¹dzimy o Pasie?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
nt|bobholl: what to bid as S i almost have pity with S :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot... incredible|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would worry  p would raise hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead in the OR |pg||
pc|s3|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
nt|antoniz: jednak trochê blokuje przeciwników i partner wie gdzie jestemy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland is not getting too much cricket.. bad weather in London|pg||
nt|serhat: 1h=@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 4+@s|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: good switch.|pg||
nt|leao:  Peter, our operator tells us that 3@s is a moderate hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: the important test England-India will be affected by the english weather|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hi:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: Poland is now up in a comfertable lead, and not undeserved by play|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, but I can't see what declarer was playing for|pg||

nt|cicus: when he did not let it ride|pg||

nt|rnmalik: x a single suiter.|pg||
nt|sybarra: speaking of dutch,  I wonder what the difference is in the ending of their names,  beek vs beeke |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: have no ideq|pg||
nt|panosk: a bit of arguing -not a lot though- keeps pard awake:) no harm there |pg||
nt|riccho:  Do u think there is junior someqhere who would pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|riccho:  there it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: have seen 20+passes with 12 count the last week|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1-2 position|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: a lucky 6c made in start may have stunned the opponents|pg||
nt|cicus: she|pg||
nt|cicus: a bold 2NT now by W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s from N should be interesting...will E find the A@h lead and continuation?|pg||
nt|serhat: but 32-32 is not good for them|pg||
mb|1C|an|17+|nt|psyck: an aggresive choice with that hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hmm with the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|mareczek: mozna te¿ zrobiæ próbê szlemikow¹, karta W jest tego warta|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: ano, znajac agresje mlodych pierwsze co pomysli W jak zobaczy 1NT czy by tu szlemika nie zagrac :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: if this is drury they play a strange version :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: like a forcing stayman |pg||
nt|bebechira: I wonder if the yougsters parents watching this...they can let us know please|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|timverbeek:  east makes it difficult to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d = void @d, 6-9 points and 2 keycards or 15+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: adn 2 nt is usually honor 3 or better  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the relay suit saying "I like clubs" |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to reach 3NT |pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt shud be spade fit and forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: omg, a pushed bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry wasnt what I meant |pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  my guess is all pass now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pewnie jeszcze padnie 5 trefli - 5 karo i wreszcie 5 kier|pg||

nt|lechcold: tak jest|pg||
mb|2H|nt|timverbeek:  west to the rescue|pg||
nt|yuval10: S IMO has a lot more than enough to carry on. He can see slam's making against A@s QJ@h Q@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes even less than that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @H lead, may be 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S by E now|pg||
nt|riccho:  really|pg||
nt|sybarra: can that be possible here? |pg||
nt|lechcold: zw³aszcza z minimum si³y|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hmm, it does not sound like a strong NT now, does it?|pg||
nt|cicus: might even show minors?|pg||

nt|mareczek: brak cue bidu pik|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: choæ ju¿ 5 karo jest bez sensu|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@d powinno obiecywac zatrzymanie w pominietym przez partnera kolorze|pg||
nt|riccho:  same weird lead as at the other table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying for the club ruff is my guess |pg||
nt|riccho:  compare the 3@s here with what W had done in bd 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand a far better (imo)|pg||
nt|riccho:  is this really the difference between red and white?|pg||
nt|bebechira: not so easy serhat...hey have 21 VPS buffer|pg||
nt|bebechira: thats a lot of VPs lol|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||
nt|vbman: when l was a junior ,,, l noted that it was the slams that made us lose matches or win them|pg||
nt|redds: trudny pierwszy wist|pg||
nt|antoniz: po ka¿dym -1 lub -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like going for slam|pg||
nt|panosk: i dont like 2nt as a choice 4@C i think is more descriptive|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hi panos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi |pg||

nt|sybarra: from a spec,  a beek is a small river;  westerbeek means river in the west|pg||
nt|raghavan: North has done well to land in S contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: south pushes a bit to be sure of at least reaching the right game|pg||
nt|athene: if he had just invited he would never be able to show the shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough lesson for N here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: another non-making 50% game|pg||
nt|vbman: good lead indeed|pg||
nt|gregpog: :)|pg||
nt|panosk: since E is a passed hand no much chance for misunderstanding but if he wasnt shows a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
nt|le joker: J@h give the contract|pg||
nt|le joker: @d looks better|pg||
nt|jkotor: potem trefl do 10@c i gwarantowane 3 treflowe|pg||
nt|serhat: I can count 40 easly on 4 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: then it would be a perfect match for Sweden|pg||
nt|bebechira: at least... but still not enough i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  extremely normal 1@S by north|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I would do the same|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but it's better we wait for the ping pong lol|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe with some qualms but E bid the obvious game|pg||
nt|cicus: and I can't see how this could go down|pg||

nt|rv: Tewari's 4@D shows both majors and ask partner to choose|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has to be 11|pg||
nt|rv: if Tewari had only a 4 card major, he would have bid it at 3 or 4 level (good 9+) depending on strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|rv: Sanjib, is Prabhakar actually thinking here?|pg||

nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||

nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
