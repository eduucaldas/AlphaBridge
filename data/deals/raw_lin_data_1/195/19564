mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: @H10|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt by west should be beaten here |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a bid that deserves to go for 1100 imo|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|suketbombi: a 3@H asking for partial stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: instead it is going to fetch 10 IMPs:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like Rajuji's suggestion of 3@h by Anand and 3n by R.A|pg||
pc|hT|nt|suketbombi: 3nt was ill advised he had to have a partial stopper with pd 3@H says doubt|pg||
nt|rv: Sumit's 2@h was fraught with risk, it has paid off here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, double dummy 3NT can also be defeated with East as declarer. Sadly, 11,913 BBO'ers would find @D10 lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes no pain no gain well timed overcall but can easily be 500 against a non making opponent game|pg||

nt|roswolf: but being charming hosts you all speak english:)|pg||

nt|rv: now 23 IMPs deficit for Mah 'A' in 13 deals to be scored|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: it is always tough though far from impossible if asking rate crosses 2 IMPs per deal|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|rv: 1n is 14-16 here possibly|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rv: double is DONT convention showing single suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: showing a singlesuiter I suppose and Sumit has guessed what is comming:)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and no club ruff, how lucky can one get|pg||
nt|rv: playing DONT convention which is very popular against 1n in Kolkatta, double shows single suiter, 2@c shows @c+another, 2@d is @d+major, 2@h shows majors|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|rv: PS's presence should be welcome to all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem with DONT is that 2@H is the bid to show both majors, and then advancerhas no room to ask for the longer|pg||
nt|psridhar: over Dont X, i think Sumit shd bid 2@H not 2 @c - saying we go places if @H is not your suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so you definitely need 2@C as showing the majors|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: so that you have 2@D available to show equal length|pg||

mb|1C|nt|dslee: expect South to open 1@D|pg||
nt|dslee: game for NS - choices of 3NT, 4@H - would prefer the latter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back Mohit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobholl: didn't he loose 2@D 1@S 1@C ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: west should be counting and re-counting now - what to bid !|pg||

pc|c5|nt|roswolf: i would have passed 2nt as east did in the other room|pg||

pc|c2|nt|psyck: S should respect the x even with defensive cards, with a balanced hand|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: Kushari had plenty of info for that shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: he knew about 6-4 shape in W|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing about all this shenanigans is that this will make the match tighter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|josj: this will shorten declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: should be 3 down |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: He knew abt AQ of @c with declarer|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer's @s therefore must be a broken suit as with KQJto 6 @s and AQ of @c he wont wjo|pg||
nt|psridhar: so no hurry for the @c ruff|pg||
nt|mohitz:  true|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Ace of spade is kinda marked with North, so this will be -1|pg||
nt|psridhar: still one needs to draw these inferences and act properly at the tbl|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: my theory is -if responder 'guesses' the DONT suit, he shows an invtn hand for all other suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: or lower suit/s at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: @h lead is best for defense here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Buddy??|pg||

nt|suketbombi: should have been 2@D opening is my guess|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: yes  i saw that in last session 2@D  opened as  444-1  |pg||
nt|rv: some folks playing precision play 2@d opening to show stiff only with perfect shapes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i think it is 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: i mean last to last session|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: i dont agree rv- last session RA opened 2@d on 3-4-1-5 -sumit passed, Samant bid 3@C on KQJXX and Laltu Xed -sumit played in 3@d finally recall?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|roswolf: i have a lot of sympathy with 3nt here|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure what NS plays , looks like precision or some form of strong @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Mostly a partials hand - unless NS is too ambitious to reach a @H game which can be taken down in a good EW def|pg||
nt|psridhar: admittedly kushari might have held @d jack and @s ace wd give only 15 to South|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 sry|pg||
nt|psyck: strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: No, sorry, think 4@H would always make|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make a few tricks in a NT contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dslee: x is 5-7|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT shows an obvious @C join|pg||
nt|dslee: x from south - 2@C by Animesh and so on i guess from here?|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry 2@S by animesh- apologies for typo|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Jack of club was known, PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally 1N is passed with balanced 8 hcp -but 2Aces is different|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS might do well to stay out of this, though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: which they will bid now :(|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mohitz:  choice of minors from Animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: this cannot be a choice of minors :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess if responder has 4M, he could try |pg||
nt|psridhar: true yes he didnt open 1N so king of @s was an error costing 2 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: i guess x was some single suiter, N would have done well to pass|pg||
nt|oliverc: Pass should be automatic by East, I feel|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: until told "officially" we have to accept what we are told|pg||

nt|oliverc: EW now in a world of hurt. East couldn't care less if South has Diamonds as West|pg||
nt|oliverc: still able to protect|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mohitz:  partner showed 6 odd clubs |pg||
nt|dslee: unless there is a specific understanding that the @C suit would be a quality one|pg||
nt|mohitz:  (presumably)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh well|pg||

nt|oliverc: West still has a bid if he has something|pg||
pc|c9|nt|josj: to overrule the umpires' clear views|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in 5@DXX, Animesh might have finessed diamond queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for -2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: still only 8 tricks on @s hook failing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mohitz:  this wll be a quick claim|pg||
nt|strike12: it is basically a relay based strong club system, |pg||
nt|dslee: but how they dint reach this game or pass in 2@C with a @C lead?|pg||
nt|dslee: i mean 2@C x?|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless India are involved:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|bobholl: TV cameras in cricket nowadays ?|pg||
nt|psyck: E was likely expecting S to bid 1@s on 1@d on which he would be stuck if does not bid immed|pg||

nt|suketbombi: in test yes and when India is batting not in one-dayers|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: actually in a recovery match the trailing side should not be unhappy with flat boards ; what they need is a couple of lucky swings along with all such flat ones|pg||

nt|dslee: for all the kibbers, Mohit is one of the very promising indian youngstars from Bangalore|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H or 2@S from EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: OR may climb to 2N and if he misguesses @d queen , can be down a bunch|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i dont think you can stop in 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: or in 4@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if inviting, North will accept surely|pg||

nt|psridhar: precn will get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: interesting choice of 1N here|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N is generally played as 15-18, but with that solid @h, had other options|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  if opening 1@D, East will probably overcall |pg||
nt|psyck: i thought either 1N or 1@c would get to game, surprisingly both didn't :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and that might affect the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: but +1 ??|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mohitz:  not sure why East didnt bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, Animesh isn't the one to go down peacefully! |pg||
nt|mohitz:  anyway, another 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar: tightens the match good|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mohitz:  PS, what defense do you play after this auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mohitz:  1@C prec followed by 1N rebid that is|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dslee: why not a simple 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|strike12: i like 2nt with @d stuff|pg||
nt|dslee: i would hate to hide my master suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: same as 1N opg|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mohitz:  defenders have to establish a heart trick|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that seems convenient but i am convinced its right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mohitz:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  because presumably with both majors etc, we would have entered over 1@D itself?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *not|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the context of no bidding in the earlier round|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mohitz:  no, but say you play 1@C - p - 1@D - X as both majors|pg||
nt|psridhar: pass and bid in immd position -south here- i play as strong ; in North it is balancing|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dslee: no quesitons asked :)|pg||
nt|dslee: best thing to do is play @D|pg||

mc|10|nt|vugraphzjy: 3 mnts break|pg||

nt|rv: asking rate of 27 in 9 (make it 7 since IR can't possibly lose in last 2 brds)|pg||
nt|psridhar: the FIRST step in recovery is to ensure you do not lose IMPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: further|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bd 43 -wrong siding made it tougher didnt it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OCS_Stand_(Surrey_v_Yorkshire_in_foreground).JPG    pretty or not?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Tharanga 103*|pg||
nt|psridhar: ideally they want their oppo to make a wild attempt at recovery and lose further|pg||

nt|roswolf: 1nt!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would a clear maximum even :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or double - tough choice imo|pg||
nt|psyck: played by E, an o/t in 5@c on @hK lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|strike12: this will be costly|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT here shows min @H support 3@C is pass or correct to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  i like 2@S by West here opposite a passed hand, gives them more trouble :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: another possiblity :)|pg||
nt|strike12: good X by N|pg||
nt|dslee: obvious one |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, the lead extends for railways|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: when do they open 1@D? this was a @D opening ideally playing the strong @C system - 1NT open would had been a little ambitious though|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for example, here is West bids 2@S, North must bid 2N which might be a level high|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *if|pg||
nt|psyck: W's @dK could well be a major K, so E will explore|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzvz: MOUSE PROBLEM SRY|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if n/s play precision 1@D MIGHT BE 0+|pg||
nt|josj: 1@H we had not thought of but it solves the problem to perfection|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: -1 or -2 depending on def and play - this x by N is penalty? I guess no|pg||
nt|psridhar: north has played this game b4 and pass 2@s like he did in Bd no 30|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay, but that might be wrong on days|pg||
nt|psridhar: on more days your 2@S will be taken to the cleaners|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@c setting suit & gf in this seq|pg||
pc|sT|nt|josj: they do|pg||
nt|mohitz:  East wont like the dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: @d short already known, so the cue should be an honor|pg||
nt|psyck: which is not particularly good news for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YES THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE OFTEN HAVE THE BEST POINT OF VIEW|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D passed out scores best :)|pg||
nt|dslee: yah, often we dont like our dummies - seldom we do :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mohitz:  he wanted to get his spade suit in|pg||
nt|mohitz:  also preempts 1@H overcalls|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not a bad strategy in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|mohitz:  i actually don't think there is a lot of risk of being taken to the cleaners if partner knows our style|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mohitz:  this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner may have no role to play |pg||
nt|mohitz:  true i agree sometimes it might go pass pass X etc|pg||
nt|psyck: no more poorly than the 3N in other room|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but in my (limited) experience it works out quite well|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mohitz:  how did you figure -1?|pg||
nt|strike12: @d shift now|pg||
nt|dslee: lets see - if its a penalty, E has a lot of clues now|pg||
nt|dslee: I bet the move will be @S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|josj: so another push|pg||
nt|psyck: that was poorly judged|pg||
nt|psyck: with no major cue, maybe W should not bid 4N, in any case E needs too much from pd for slam after 4@d bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes. If West not encouraged by the @H cue and can't show the Spade king, East|pg||
nt|oliverc: should subside in 5@C|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@c played by E after the lead of @h K would be on ... all other leads and position is down one|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h was rkc i'm told|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, no chance played by West|pg||
nt|psyck: but looking at 4N response, maybe they were not on the same page|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|bobholl: now not a push jos :)|pg||

nt|psyck: nv, decent suit, some shape, i've no gr8 objection to 2@s|pg||

nt|dslee: this would be a @S partial for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: .|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing standard, the auction might go 1N all pass|pg||
nt|drkvas:  3nt seems to be the favorite destination|pg||
nt|mohitz:  they will open 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, both the sides plays strong @C|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i mead on many deals like 3 4 2 9 etc|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure if they top it by 1NT 15-17|pg||

nt|drkvas:  i request ps to commentrate pls he is the best in buissiness in india|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, kaustubh did bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Dipak doubled which seems like a mistake|pg||
nt|psyck: N did not have any good choice on 2@s |pg||
nt|psridhar: he had a GOOD choice alright -pass ; but he needed to think of it|pg||

nt|dslee: all spots with the opps in the right places|pg||
nt|psyck: not yet reached Kushari's level i guess :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: 6@D or 6NT on here with a lie of the lucky cards|pg||

nt|psyck: other table would not expect any big scores so far, but EW here know they are down now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dslee: transfer?|pg||
nt|strike12: will u bid 1nt  frm N?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  can make 4@S |pg||
nt|mohitz:  but will play a spade partial|pg||
mb|d|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i feel if ur playing strong @c 15 17 nt makes no sense|pg||
nt|dslee: Raj 1 has to pull up in next 10, this I guess is gone for them|pg||
nt|drkvas:  u can play 14 15 if u like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  putting up all nt ranges in 1@C hurts during competition|pg||
nt|dslee: no 1NT here from E?|pg||
nt|dslee: N for his pass is assumed to hold a @H length and @S short|pg||
nt|psridhar: there are other objectives to bidding than just give your lho a problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: 3nt by N is best but difficult to reach now ...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n frivilous interference hurts too|pg||
nt|strike12: 1@h is specifically 4 @s so E might wait and watch here|pg||
nt|dslee: since 1@S is opened , they can take off to 4 now|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this looks an inevitable 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: W comes to rescue|pg||
nt|strike12: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: S has the values for at least one raise now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@S opening is systemic|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will invite|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and North will reject i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  better play not play in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: maybe N is considering a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a push too time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|josj: remote...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, east opened 1N all pass|pg||
nt|dslee: would had bid 3@S here if at all|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in NT, defenders can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dslee: not the most obvious lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas:  i think rajasthans team is an adhoc 1|pg||
nt|mohitz:  opposite a PH, that has to be one of the primary objectives imo|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway i dont endorse 2@s and not interested in discussing its merits /demerits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mohitz:  South might bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  fair enough|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|bobholl: kind of slamtry may be :)|pg||

nt|dslee: no chance of going down in traditional play now :)|pg||
nt|dslee: unless N thinks of pulling up some staunts|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what is traditional play?|pg||
nt|barbyh: not going to be a good result, 5 d is cold  so is 4 sp without a trump lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|strike12: yes what would pass and 2@d convey here then?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, it depends on agreements|pg||

nt|mohitz:  i assume bd 6 is not at the table yet |pg||
nt|strike12: 2h opening byN|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing more than 2@S or 3@H partials|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is a stretch to say the least|pg||
nt|dslee: and fron the wrong hand too|pg||
nt|mohitz:  another partial|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will likely open a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the bad spade break means that even 3@S is in trouble|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2N can be defeated on good defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so Kepri just recorded the biggest swing of the match so far, no less than 4 imps|pg||

nt|mohitz:  3@H i guess|pg||

nt|roswolf: penalty axe!?|pg||
nt|josj: just -1...|pg||
nt|josj: but better than -200|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is hands off penalty after a leb 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a swing of 250 anyway :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: so 6 more to Kepri|pg||

nt|psyck: a very close finish indeed, and even the couple of imps here could hurt|pg||

nt|suketbombi: Hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: IR won nearly plenty of unanswered IMPs towards towards end of 3rd segment to storm back into contention|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: het to lead from the West hand against 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East hand rather|pg||
nt|rv: as Rajuji suggested they are also fielding their 4 most experienced foursome|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: @s lead looks reasonable though it will be costly|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  will make 10 tricks Imagine a @D lead:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rv: I might have led a @s as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 rounds of diamonds and a club through, but he can still make|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Maybe not but academic anyway|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|rv: Sumit bid 2@c planning to bid 3@s to show 4@s+5@h (smolen) if Banerjee had bid 2@d on stayman|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of this segment. Thanks to our operator, Andri - Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Jos and Bob for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this could be another swing for IR if Manas-Amarnath get to 3n instead of 4@s in OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barbyh: game depends on opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: another slam and once again not such  good one, worse than the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pulling 3NT seems strange. He did bid his spades three times before that|pg||
nt|panja: classical precision 2@D...4441 or 5431...short @D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: yes Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: And he has excellent cards for notrump after that|pg||
nt|barbyh: no d lead is good for declarer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: yes @DQ is a gold card and 2 outside kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: blank honour works either way provided you guess correctly which way :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might be bid|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all, last segment of 14 boards will start in a little while after this.|pg||
nt|psyck: WB seem to have gone overboard on deal 54 too...looks like all over for them|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: both pards showing shortages - great news|pg||
nt|psyck: Will be Railways-Maharastra A finals tomorrow assuming scores are right.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I hope they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|bobholl: lunch is ready so have to go tya cu :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: for result : http://halamanbridge.org/batam/|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will soon see|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Manas's 3@d here would be NF, hence his decision to temporise with 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to tje|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry|pg||
nt|rv: Banerjee could have rebid his @s suit once more instead of slightly contrived 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to the king, @DQ, king ace, club to dummy, @D9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so 3NT will make in comfort|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|bobholl: they know :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|josj: ty Andri and cu |pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Manas's 2n was F1, I actually prefer 2n instead of 3@c even if 3@d was NF|pg||
