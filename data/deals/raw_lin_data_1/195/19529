nt|Walddk2: End of the round, short break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 51 rounds of 2 boards over two days|pg||
nt|petka: it seems the players were a bit blinded by their tens and jacks on that deal. The east hand is probably not a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|petka: the west hand however is worth an invitation IMO over 2S|pg||
nt|petka: those aces and the spade jack look promising|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4@s -1 was over ave to playing site -4@s in first board (25) was 28%|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|yuval10: as an outsider who's looking at the Svensk results, i really see him a lot in the first places|pg||

nt|petka: tommy and morath have many, many|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14-16 is a popular range in Sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: last chance to get + inn 3 @s but i doupth the stop|pg||
nt|yuval10: then i'm not sure if 2NT is everyone's choice|pg||
nt|yuval10: with balanced hand and minimum|pg||

nt|petka: that would have been a difficult play for NS to find, since declarer might take 11 fast tricks holding doubleton diamonds|pg||
nt|staffffan:  it should be easy to defend against 4 @H.(normal contract?) A-K @S and before making a decision play @C A|pg||
nt|yuval10: but so many pairs has made 4@h in the EW cards|pg||
nt|staffffan:  still, seeing east's diamonds?|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks likely that most of the N players played 3 rounds of @s, and declarer got the @h's right ( he has no other choice )|pg||
