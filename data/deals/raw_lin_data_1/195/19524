pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|sveing: Hi all:) this is the final round of this session (round 4) 7 boards|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should be on their way to slam now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver|pg||
nt|april7: actually , after @D and @D ruff W should give up a @H as long he has ace of @S and making m5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both west supported on a good doubleton. Key bid to reach the heart game|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H*|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, easts :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Oliver|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N a bit too optomistic of N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Overnight leaders are E-W|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The so-called naturalists play a quite complexed system developed by Per Ongstad. He calls it Streamlined Culbertson|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: ew are warned now -can they make rigth decision now+|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  but can't blame him since S simply asked for a @h stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h a very marginal overbid, but you have four trumps |pg||
nt|april7: if N switches to @S, contract is down, but very difficult|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 9 of diamonds discourage. Suggests a shift|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 4@s explained as cuebid from N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Jim probably just wanted to show secondary support|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|april7: W has then to cash Aand K of @H and play on @C,then also 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done champ!|pg||
nt|sverjohn: And we may expect some quite unusual auctions|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Hei SG|pg||
nt|sveing: Hi Roland:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you shut out 2@s and 3@c from NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now, if North doesn't switch to a spade, this can make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: Yes. West might have struggled in 2@H, but little chance for Declarer now|pg||
nt|sveing: Tre knekter og ettS are leaders after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: More roads to one down here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Smat move by Marstrander, but declarer did not fall for it, and should not|pg||
nt|april7: now AK of @H and then @C!!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Results at http://bridgefestival.no/results.htm|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Hilde|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be better than 3nt with @d out ,but still down because bad sits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smart even|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 8 tricks, I fear|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CK could have been onside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would still give West 12 hcp for his opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to find 3 pitches|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Welcome back to the Norwegian Swiss teams Penultimate round and Abax have been in the lead all day|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: South played @c7 then @c9 - if normal-style caridng, that should indicate someting in spades|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 5 clubs looks like a decent contract here. Can it be reached in the open room?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Ruff and discard rarely successful|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Lead was quite favourable for declarer. More trouble with the "normal" diamond lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sverjohn: Welcome to the last session of the Norwegian Swiss Teams Championships|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sverjohn: Some people play a direct jump to the 3-level as a singleton. Could be ideal here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|runnerup: actully with small @d out -here it goes better ofcause|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sveing: sitting EW here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The so called garbage multi is popular among the younger players in Norway.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  that seemed pretty blunt|pg||
nt|april7: well done by W|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|runnerup: so it needs @c quess now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|oliverc: In practice West would have had to make themselves vulnerable to an endplay on|pg||
nt|oliverc: the run of the Diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|penseur9: this session will be 10 match of 2 boards each|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 11 Victory points is the difference between these two teams currently 1st and 2nd with Abax in the lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: not a good start for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: N disagree with partners discarding on @cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why is it, that every time you let through a game, it is vulnerable?  |pg||
pc|h8|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: W - Johnny Hansen partnered with Siv Thoresen (OR) and one of our top lat players, in the Norw team championship, placed 2nd, and also in Pairs a few days age|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Hand does not break well for E-W Difficult to win game|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  in the slam zone|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztc: updated results|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: another @H contract by EW, although losing at least 4 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Here we go with Streamline. 10-14 with 5 hearts I believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sharkey: Great MP or BAM score :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be an important swing here. Trigger happy South in open room|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, 9-12|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|andersk: Might be case for playing @S Q, since South opened and N have @C A|pg||
nt|oliverc: just has to get the @S's right|pg||
nt|andyv:  now we will see how good a guesser N is|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: Sandsmark: "What kind of blackwood do you use?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: pass?|pg||
nt|loe48: 3c is showing some cards now i assume|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|loe48: :)|pg||
nt|sveing: so here we go again|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: this is the last segment today. back tomorrow 10 AM local time|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Seems like declarer has two options for his 9th trick. Here both work|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sverjohn: Ovesen won yesterday's pairs championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Dangerous preference. North must suggest 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: Assume 2 NT shows 3@H & max|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: club switch best but not enough|pg||
nt|sveing: easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: good position for NS, losing only at most 2 @S 1 @H and 1 @C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sveing: not enough but if she use the Q?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: does not matter|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 3@S & max|pg||
mb|p|nt|sveing: yor are right|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Cards lie well for declarer here. 12 tricks to be taken, but slam is not odds-on|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She has a pitch on @DK|pg||
mb|5D|nt|runnerup: ligth takeout double and they found a game -now only to make /+1 -even perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Hansen tried a "passive" lead. Did not work too well, but which lead would|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andersk: Even with @D K lead, u have nothin to discard @C on, so better find out where @C A is by playing @C|pg||
nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is that he will play E for J@s|pg||
nt|sveing: yepp|pg||
nt|sverjohn: To beat the contract, take your tricks and lock him in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Should be able to beat this one now. Declarer can score 4 hearts and 3 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Yes!|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|april7: ace of @S and @D Q|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sverjohn: nice duck|pg||
nt|sverjohn: small spade! :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: they are writing on the bridgemate, not thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR on board 2, N bid 2N (instead of dbl) and S bid 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Liv Marit, good morning to you|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liv|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: hi all :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Modern neg. double style. Denies 4 spades. Not suitable for 1 NT|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1 or 3 clubs, that's the question. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Bj√∏rn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: S is Ekrens brother|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, this is Steinar Ekren I now see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Liv Marit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like need to find @SQ in 4@S unless pitch @D on 13th @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|johnp: Hi all, ready now|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
nt|sverjohn: When in doubt, bid 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: a slam coming up but good save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could very well reach the normally nice grand now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Another coffee hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England most would respond as East - 1NT most likely|pg||
nt|april7: could be pushed to 7!!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: They violated Hamman's rule...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This can go astray now. Rekstad may have shown a better hand|pg||
nt|april7: another swing here if it makes or going down, one way or other|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Not enough tricks for NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphztc: 3@c shows A or K in @d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  this should be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, the suit behaves so 4@s is safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure what he intended - only 13 HCP|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both sides overbidding here. Do not like Berset's 3 diamonds. What are his extras?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|johnp: Please adwise link for result and cam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps North might have tried 5@D en route - then South can take a swing at 5@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: He may have made it too difficult for himself - many would simply bid 3 NT over 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1@d probably denies 5c majors|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: always only 12 tricks!!but tempting to bid 7NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sverjohn: Lunna showed the Ace of hearts, but Andersbakk could only find 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Johansen in for a difficult task here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sverjohn: They probably dont play 2/1 GF Then 2NT would stand out a mile|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Lunna's pass showed hA|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But will maybe escape for 1 down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: no cam this year|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even though it might be an unsuccessful swing|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Karlsen - Thoresen missed the slam board 1. Makes the mixup even more expensive|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sverjohn: Needs the spade K onside. Means both read kings probably in south's hand|pg||

pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: South had to do that to keep an entry to dummy - wanted East to have single 10 or J |pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  3N has the plus of testing both @hs and @ds for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|sverjohn: good lead. Declarer can prevail by leading small heart twice|pg||
pc|s6|nt|loe48: correct play is small play from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S is wash&go|pg||
nt|sverjohn: from dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Hansen knew from the bidding that his pd had at least 7 hearts|pg||
nt|april7: an unlucky deccision by S bidding 7, otherwise big swing for his team|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sverjohn: Not my choice of an opening bid, but worked well|pg||

nt|andyv:  probably 3N by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By North even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably on a D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: both ways should lead to 3nt as i assume 3c show some values|pg||
nt|oliverc: So Declarer got the Spades wrong on  9|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell whether lack of entries or E having only 1@h influenced N in the @s suit.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I have visitors and have to go. Thanks everyone. Enjoy the rest of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: he played spade to the queen and then the 9 to W jack|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: on board 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I get a 10% bonus every time I mention wash&go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: head&shoulders only offered 7%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4033  Siv Thoresen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder why he played for the drop....|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So Abax takes the first 3 imps from the first hand. Expect these last two to be pushes|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@S going down on a @H lead, so NS should stay out ofcourse, let see if possible|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Stealing the opponents suit|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mdgraham: well, if you don't double something that makes from time to time you aren't doubling enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: has to find @s fit somehow here -to bid 6|pg||
nt|johnp: @s slam but how to get there?|pg||
nt|penseur9: or more :)|pg||
nt|loe48: if they use lebensohl|pg||
nt|sverjohn: If spade queen doesnt drop, there is a chanceof establishing a club trick to ditch a diamond|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could be some fireworks here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This opening could very well lead to slam|pg||
mb|2N|an|6-7p|nt|andyv:  might just bid 3N now|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't have enough hair to make that worthwhile :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Good sacrifice|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Takes a diamond lead to kill it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sverjohn: Looks like a pretty standard game hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what will South do here - pass most likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 2NT to be forcing, or better play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and needs to guess @DQ, with not a lot to go on|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 5h is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 3@D is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would probably go down on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: And good decision by Berset|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Trumps do not behave, but spades and diamonds are more friendly|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2Nt was maybe limited|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because both contracts depend on @DQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that they can't beat 3NT, unfair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, on the spade layout, this has chances |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|johnp: 2@d=GF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All too predictable|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Strange that Lunna didnt enter in this vuln. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|sverjohn: So, time for coffee|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1 @s denied 4-card majors,not suitable for a NT bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  a little bit of work...first tackle the easy suit..@hs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: south has some cards after north bids @s so slam found -guessed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: nobody said life was fair |pg||
nt|april7: with a signletzon @H and a 5th @C slam would be on and S might have tried by bidding 5@S asking for second round control in @H, but iS is not strong anough|pg||
nt|sverjohn: clearly a case for not bidding here, but pd would bid 2h with much stronger cards|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|johnp: hm|pg||
nt|johnp: imo blind shot when bidding, but I am offside so...|pg||
nt|penseur9: will need to establish is @Ds first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 out of 2 right, time to retire|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Hard to blame North though, if he thought his partner's hand was relatively balanced   |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Open room copied the misdefence on hand 15|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andersk: good lead|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So Ovesen refused to show his hearts settling for 2 diamons |pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  @s suit will be a pleasent suprise to declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: south must have been a little woryed of second round @h control ,but north had it|pg||

nt|loe48: 6c or 6s is my guess here|pg||
nt|loe48: i think 6c is the best team spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Less than 25%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the Discworld novels million-to-one chances come up nine times out of ten |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - these are 7 board matches so one hand can decide the entire match. Big lead to Abax now|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 3min break|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H opening by N and then....???let see what E does|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Lots of tricks, but how would hearts work E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2min break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: E-W needed that. Should have continued clubs to keep the spade trick away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnp: Another national champ (N)...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done by E-W in the open. Karlsen knows his pd. could be very aggressive in these situations|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  NS might get to a pushy 3N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: May have given a few back on the last hand. Impossible to picture pd with a single heart I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW are placed 3rd after four matches; NS 11th|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: some very forward bidding next door|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|veistikke:  isnt multi showing 6@s 6@h or a strong hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: top 8 ATM can win, I beleve 9th and further will be too far behind|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Further actions from N-S could be expensive|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: 2@D equal length in the majors|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sveing: but i think he will bid that|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Breaks not too good for E-W here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Karlsen knows to switch to a diamond when in with @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not unreasonable to do so|pg||
nt|april7: should be|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: 4@s?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Too little. Why not 2NT first round|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: very unilateral|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as declarer is marked with @SAK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why not @H off dummy?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Dont like this type of deffending|pg||
nt|sverjohn: a killing lead.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2 diamond losers if he doesnt duck in trick one|pg||

nt|penseur9: EW presently in first and NS in 17th place|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did their job|pg||
nt|loe48: 1/4|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Maybe he thought his hand too weak for a 3h preempt vuln. |pg||
nt|sverjohn: Why has pd silent? Probably has clubs!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup: greedy 3 @h -top was found already -now a lot of wotk to do|pg||
pc|s9|nt|loe48: 5h ask spade q|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andersk: I think young Eide might be a little too agressive with a strong NT behind he's partner|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Its late in the day.......:)|pg||
nt|penseur9: oups, 7@Sx ????|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  S put to immediate guess|pg||
nt|sverjohn: looks like 8 tricks on any major suit continuation|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: It complicates the defence|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|loe48: and 6s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may cause problems|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|april7: I think 4 @H bid is forbidden, once you open weak!!! so he pays for it!!!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  now in danger of going down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|johnp: Easy to say: lead @h, but we see all cards|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes we agreeded that at once :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could have been beaten with repeated diamonds|pg||
nt|sharkey: West now also had to rely on finesse with @C9 - perhaps a little lucky|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Spade Q gets promoted|pg||
nt|sharkey: claim|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|loe48: doesnt matter to much the guess|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sverjohn: Well, so much for predictions. H√∏yland found a double board 4. Did not paralyze declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sveing: maybe better to use K of @S the first time.. then it could be a lead from AQJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence needs to be careful now, otherwise East might be endplayed with a spade   |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  makes 4@c if he guesses to put in 10@h|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|loe48: as u see here|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|sveing: not use the card evryone nows you have:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Really?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: better|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: with @S9 high in dummy?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|loe48: but they to high..and in wrong spot to try|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West had to rise @DK there|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|loe48: 3nt is a fair try ..and shall be tried vul|pg||
nt|andyv:  but hard to bid after the major suit showing by W|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: and Karlsen failed |pg||
nt|mdgraham: to lead a club through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Had to swallow partner's @DQ|pg||

nt|sveing: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
nt|april7: at least its a good chance and costs nothing!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Heading for the same result? In teams often good to bid a simple 3NT with 27-28 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  interesting bidding.  Contract looks normal although in OR they played in 1NT|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 2NT must have been forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2nt was forcing y|pg||
nt|sharkey: Must be - else cant find any extras with S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: sry, weak multi|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|runnerup: 9 looks normal -10 good|pg||
nt|loe48: a normal 3nt to come in|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Game is very borderline here. Cards lie well for declarer. Without any intermediaries Bergs pass is quite ok|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: 4th time today JT in @D|pg||
nt|andersk: stiffed|pg||
nt|runnerup: @c king would have been better lead this time|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|johnp: or@s...|pg||
nt|sveing: Results after match 3|pg||
nt|sverjohn: New big swing to Abax. Title is probably clinched now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: eleven top tricks, with chances fr twelve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can set up 5th spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wow|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|loe48: maybe a better bidding would be 3d over 2d, then 3s|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Berg and Svendsn missed the game on board 24 playing 3h on a 5-1 fit|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andersk: possible show up squeeze, however the @H finess is off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sverjohn: Ovesen working hard for the extra imp here once he got the chance|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Another IMP to Abax|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: not that clear to play the club ace - prd doenst normally have a singleton ...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|loe48: you probably makes 6 spades also with careful play|pg||
nt|loe48: the misstake he did was take ace of spade as i can see|pg||
nt|sveing:  Last one were big swingboard. After the double i think he should had made this contract.:)|pg||
nt|loe48: i think you can get to an endplay situation if you do not|pg||

nt|loe48: and thats an invite with 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW did well to drive NS out of their makeable contract(s)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 matches of 7 boards today, 4 tomorrow to end the week long festival|pg||
nt|andyv:  with lots of pairs using Ogust over weak 2 bids, the quality of the suit becomes less relevent...and multi 2@ds also has no requirement as to suit quality.|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: well played by Marstrander|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board of this set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am willing to risk that spades are not 7-0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East can afford it....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takk igjen til Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: back 13.05|pg||
nt|mdgraham: already? That was quick|pg||
nt|sveing: last board. Starting again in 1hour and 45 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2min break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: What a result from the open room! North never bid his diamonds. But 6 clubs is on|pg||
nt|sharkey: East never supported @C...|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: one more match today|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: last board in this match, next match will begin 19.45|pg||
nt|sverjohn: So the match has a new leader|pg||
nt|sverjohn: There seems to have been a crash in the open room, but SHHG are in 4 hearts dbl. on  board 25 so big swings for Abax coming up|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Possible swing here too. 4@s is makeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sverjohn: 3 hard earned imps to the naturalists thanks to the dbl. in open room|pg||
mb|d|nt|loe48: i mean just ignore the bids and bid like you normally would..many use x of 2c as stayman in that pos|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit. Fin jobb som vanligt!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well in a way he did. 1S denies a 4-card major and long diamonds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: And here is another chance|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 4 clubs hearts + clubs?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|sharkey: Weird hand - East phsyched 1@S; East didn support wih AKxx, and, as Sverre said, N didnt bother to bid his @D...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Yes, matches of 7 boards. One more match before the lunch break|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  6  @h tricks about the maximum output of the NS hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: May bid slam here|pg||
nt|sverjohn: The naturalists do not promise major suit when they make take-out doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i personally also use it..so system is on after bids|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1@d is strong if he has a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 1nt is 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: may have majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 2@c shows minor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphztc: click on Sesjon 6 for latest update|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Even natural bidders dont pass 11 counts these days with 5 controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnp: Stenberg (as Scandinavian named), invite or GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Liv Marit, great job!|pg||
nt|sveing: all like that 2@C bid? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  this will be a swing for EW...S being conservative with this vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Pass was alerted. Probably asked for a xx by pd.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: not on that suit|pg||
nt|april7: the good position and a good guess in @S makes it here a slam, but not reachable, or maybe yes!!!??|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: EW plays 2@H as weak raise in @d or nat GF w@h|pg||
nt|sverjohn: RKCB will reveal 2 aces missing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Nice breaks, not too common after this kind of auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: this canape opening put this normal contract to different hand than else where -perhaps different opening lead -east leads @h to make that easy|pg||
nt|veistikke:  they should try, they need imp|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Had to keep his hands off that card |pg||
nt|veistikke:  looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 8 clubs and 3 diamonds?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  nvm|pg||
nt|veistikke:  :P|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: the crash in OR means that we are not connected right now, so there will be no link between the scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: H√∏yland trusts Bakke to have a stopper. Dont think Bakke agrees|pg||
mb|4S|nt|penseur9: sorry don't see that here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sveing: 2@C are begging for trouble i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: This match will end 12-11 - a VP tie I presume...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4-3 fits tough enough but even tougher when the 4 card suit is taking the taps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphztc: sry, weak raise in @s|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Wise decision by Rekstad|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sverjohn: Good defensive bidding. West can hardly raise on his flat minimal hand|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Board 25 was 14 imps to Abax|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 4 hearts went for -500|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Should gain 2 imps here NS|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: back in ten minutes|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  S's @c spots guarantee 1 @c tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: should have plyed a diamond|pg||
nt|sverjohn: I think 1@s promises 5 in the Bakke-H√∏yland system, so he may have thought that Bakke had a singleton when not giving secondary support|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  trick|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Thoresen line better. Took the first diamond and ran the clubs|pg||
