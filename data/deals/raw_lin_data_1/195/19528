nt|uttam: good aft from India|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Netherlands are 7th currently, which means they have plenty of motivation (6th place goes to the world championship)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w tej rundzie potykaj¹ siê dru¿yny z 2 i 3 miejsca depcz¹ce naszym po piêtach - Anglia i Izrael...¿yczymy im z calego serca remisu|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Straight forward 3NT to start with|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
nt|kemperg: so an important match|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like this can make, losing a @C, 2@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CK and @DK weel placed, no problems |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: ok han er ikke her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi apecs - Minko - Richard|pg||
nt|2hplus4: hi there everyone|pg||
nt|2hplus4: N might have tried a second round X|pg||
nt|rado: zdr:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that they reversed 1@H and 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: hi Oosman bhai|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ur wlc|pg||
pc|s2|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco bid quite little with minor monster, but partner doesn't have @C J so 5@D seems most likely to go down, would need 2 entries in Rubinos hand + ruff to raise diamond suit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Johan|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H (trf)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi all thx rito|pg||
pc|s4|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like the 4@S bid myself, it looks more like 3@S to me|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie wiem natomiast czy naszym na odprawie przypomniano, ¿e pod Warn¹ zgin¹³ jeden znaszych królów póniej Warneñczykiem zwany...z r¹k tureckich sk¹din¹d...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  9 lucky tricks E/! in a @S-contract|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Bob.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've see Birman lead 4th instead of 3rd, starting to wonder about that|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR W in 3@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: very simple equation for Agustin and co... they must win.. and win big|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  italy still has a tiny chance of winning this tournament...they need a huge win and a huge defeat by israel, not very likely but you never know|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  belgium is second to last but has done ok with an experimental team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eliran_a: hi all and welcome going to be a great match ! 1st against the 2nd !|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: on a @C lead RK has to guess the @Hq|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: still only 8 tricks as @Ds dont break|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc would never missed that in my own hometown|pg||
nt|zebutin: :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Good show VG Team. Nice to bring up an unprepared for tiebreak to all.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: but Israel will probably have to say something about this ....|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we must say that they had a great tournament.. fantastic players|pg||
nt|richie: probably, let's see, it has already been proven they are excellent players but  not infallable|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol... |pg||
nt|bebechira: Eliran will say something about this for sure....|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Markku|pg||
pc|d2|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||

nt|marionmi:  hi all|pg||
nt|richie: hi Marion :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good mornin - dzieñ dobry - witam Pañstwa w ostatnim dniu rozgrywek dziewcz¹t|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so down he will go|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: will go down 3 against a partscore at best|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||
nt|oosb: even @C are blocked for defence|pg||
nt|uttam: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  very important match here between the nr 1 and 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest to przedostania runda, druga po³owa meczy pomiêdzy dwiema pierwszymi dru¿ynami w tabeli|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 4S but it should have cost|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|richie: great result for the french in the open room, +500|pg||
nt|iceblue: misunderstood, i guess|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a w piki gra³o siê niele...nawet bardzo niele...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Hei alle. Sorry for at eg e litt sein.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gronkvist:  1@c is 12-14 ntor 18-19 Nt or Natural with transfer respones|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like easy 10 tricks, losing 1 in both majors and diamond, so still little time to get coffee|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and it's a good occasion to meet some world class players such as Agustin Madala|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dan_ehh: possibly going down now, as Padon has discarded his low @H and might get to ruff declarer's king|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|eliran_a: both players of italy and israel are players from the highest level in the juniors playing over 8 or 9 years of massive bridge |pg||
nt|joemanjo: The rules are a 4 board Tie Break, followed by a 2 board sudden death I think.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: So this is a fine balance between Matchpoints and IMPs for these boards.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bebechira: west in 2s dbled in the open room...fireworks starting... very good|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: well after the @D break he will get @H right but not enuf|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bebechira: may be special sequence|pg||
nt|raghavan: PARTNER OPENS BEUGER HAS good hand why stop in 2D|pg||
nt|iceblue: S must play this 2@D as XYZ, game forcing.|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
nt|chick: doubled would have cost enough to make my point :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with J@C favourably placed, 3@S makeable.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: unless he guesses the @SJ too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: i am expecting a high level match with some creative stuff ! the players are really talented|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps in 2nd seat 3S is enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Trying to do 5 here  but|pg||
nt|bobholl: they helped declarer with the development of @C and @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Prabhakar recalculating his lines again and again|pg||
nt|joemanjo: unless the SCOC has something different from the BFI handbook, as per BFI hand book 4 board Tiebreak followed by 2 board sudden death. |pg||
nt|joemanjo: and then repeat sudden death of 2 boards until result achieved|pg||
nt|joemanjo: so if it goes on like the previous years Wimbledon, we could theroritically be here for a few days! :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S is actually less likely to be doubled for penalty than 4@S is|pg||
pc|d6|nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Swapan is feeling the squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|nt|_fonzie__:  very nice play by madala to make the double finesse|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: what will happen to that 3rd spade?|pg||
nt|richie: 3nt = 430 and in 2@s you have 6 tricks so -300 it seems|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Ale Wojtek chyba zapomnia³, ¿e k³¹d³em nacisk na wskazanie dwukolorowoci rêki szczególnie w licytacji obronnej|pg||
nt|joemanjo: hmm already tide has turned against EW. |pg||
nt|joemanjo: 1n made 8 tricks in the other room|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|loe48: ja var jo en god runde forrige..gutta e rvarme i troeya naa|pg||
pc|c8|nt|richie: 11 imps to France|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: nice 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: only 5 tricks in the closed it seems.... so what is 2 imps between friends|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: north thinkinh|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a flat board of 10 tricks in hearts contract|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  note that 6@s is a bad contract but not completely hopeless. all you need is spades 3-2, diamonds 3-2 and 2 spades with 2 diamonds (or bare @d QJ)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sitting well enough to make 4@h|pg||
nt|richie: many people will bid 1NT in north, but I like dbl more when you hold only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: England had a steady start in the test vs India... cricket of course|pg||
nt|szalay:  hi all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||
nt|bebechira: team profiles Netherlands http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: juniorskiej |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but N would not have been doubling for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: not only is it a level lower, but it would double to game, whereas NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: so it's safer, and might push the opps too high, whereas 4@S has all the downsides|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1nt overcall maybe not to everyones taste, in zone, with 14hcp and 5card major...|pg||
nt|szalay:  I'm GyÃ¶rgy Szalay from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi György|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a really funny 1N call|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like 4 @C tricks, 2 @H tricks, but 7th might be a problem|pg||
nt|szalay:  u know crazy man or genious: depends on outcome|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||

nt|2hplus4: 3NT looks like being beaten by a S lead from either side|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@C is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I wonder if they can find it after west showing both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 2d=good raise|pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood to Israel|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s went 3 down, first imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay:  do u mean stiff J/T?|pg||
nt|szalay:  in that case West could lead that (6card)|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable 2@H now ?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  east has to make this against a probable pass out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: after a redbl this shd be a penalty dbl|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes sunil :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and Swapan shd pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and he has a chance with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Satya thinking|pg||
pc|dT|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes this difficult |pg||
nt|richie: "blood" ? :) they score in IMPS not in blood|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: uffffffff|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Sarkar|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi sunil :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT very good in closed room, only 9 triks in 4@H withot defencive help|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good start ther to play @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: dhamapur, Vijay Anand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
nt|zebutin: would he? with 2card support to partners major and only 1 entry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Souren is recalculating hands, and in deep thought|pg||
nt|joemanjo: here EW may score 2 imps or more for overtricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|szalay:  but he has at least 2@Ds and 2 @s..|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: well... i would argue this in this match|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bebechira: Schwartz in 3nt|pg||
nt|eliran_a: only if west had 3 hearts 4@h could go down on a @s lead now as the cards set nothing can take it down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks beatable|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT can be defeated with a @clead or return, 4@h is shaky but it should make|pg||
nt|richie: Madala fears @cA is wrong for him...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this will be murder|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will not helped this time|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||
nt|iceblue: S|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So now 2 down|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: yes vul against nv :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 5D had better play|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  probably down now if N or S switches to hearts on time|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and may decide this match against Poddar|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Kiran forgot to lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Operator, South's name is  Fisher|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi and welcome.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bebechira: S in 2nt in the closed so we will have the first swing|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  E is 1Nt in other room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
nt|doks: sorry 10|pg||
nt|doks: must count more precise|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 4h better no?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Had to play D the other way|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a club now|pg||
nt|richie: but he has no other chance then playing 2@d, and a @c to K|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Poddar is the treasurer of the National Federation and also the sponser of this tourney.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|indiablues:  @C unblock|pg||
mc|10|nt|bebechira: 3off for 500?|pg||
nt|eliran_a: if madala is playing now @s to the ace he will probably would go down as west jump with the @HA and plays a club for ruff|pg||
nt|joemanjo: i suppose Tewari did unblock the Ten :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: yes, exactly|pg||

nt|bebechira: just came home ...dinner time in Oz|pg||
nt|richie: only chance is @cQx then playing J from dummy is not helping|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might not. OR at 3NT and @H lead as well|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So no misdefence  here|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Declarer could play D for K in S or J in N singletons|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  aha slam time|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk RK need not have bid and saved thisa|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice double fit|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: true sunil |pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ok we got it. needed that unblock (playing Ten under the Queen) to get a ready entry to dummy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: hi:)|pg||
nt|gio 89: we are back for 2nd half of italy-poland match|pg||
nt|richie: she decides to show just ONE major, 2@d = multi|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like 1N-3N, but the @Ds don't split|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and if north leads a @S the side entry will disappear|pg||
nt|bebechira: Cook out...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  As i understand altho not sure N-S for not so long ago 1-2 years they did now have any junior pd .. so "sweeden"put them toghether:) and i am guess'ing no one regrets that:) (if i remember correct)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gio 89: italy doing not so good, down 36 at the moment|pg||
nt|gio 89: (you will excuse me if i won't be 100% impartial :) )|pg||
nt|bebechira: she could've created a problem for -2 ...|pg||
nt|richie: hi all|pg||
nt|richie: good morning to all|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  its 20 board in a row in this class|pg||
nt|zebutin: another matter is was there anything worth the upgrade for...atleast was lacking in intermediates|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H seems to make, so lets see if they can find it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 11 tricks in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: hi Richard|pg||
nt|richie: hi Traian :)|pg||
nt|richie: enjoy your meal :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use it my self as well, but only with a single honor A or K. Never with the Q or less|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the test match i mean....lol|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankbo: fikk hjem 4S i åpent på første spillet|pg||
nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the Dutch girls draw the first blood|pg||
nt|bebechira: just came home...from dinner|pg||
nt|bobholl: being a senior i wouldn't "dream" of tring for game with the N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||

nt|eliran_a: briman might make a try for game with his hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: trying |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so 6 ... 1 down shd be par|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Som is thinking bending his legs up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh puppet stayman, I keep forgetting that|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @s can be dwfeated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes D not good enough the other way declarer played properly|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: jitu discussing lead with Suresh|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: & than pass:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will bending legs help the brain work better ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|richie: they may even get to 4@s, dbl-ed in south?|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR @CQ is the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: -west argees and 500?|pg||
nt|richie: west has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Even a slamtry :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ohh well:) a few imps for sweeden|pg||
mb|3S|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think I like 3N with the E hand even though there is a remote chance of finding a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: a few only ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now should be fine|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N and find partner with xx in @S or @C :(|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@h and 2@s are part of relay. 2N can come with 5 card heart and 5332.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c artificial showing all types of strong hands, to which 2@d is a positive response|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D vul against non-vul.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so Poddar pull back... this shd surely be a swing for them|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 100% sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: dror have a nice hand but still his daimonds are useless|pg||
nt|eliran_a: not a good hand to raise with for a game|pg||
nt|zebutin: they sailed in to 5@H on other room, so might be good gain for Netherlands|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wonder if south knows about the 4 card fit though|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello Sunil & all|pg||
nt|joemanjo: so am sure all bids alerted at the table |pg||
pc|s5|nt|2hplus4: Good lead when dummy is known to be short in D|pg||
nt|richie: is 3@h semi-natural? east could also bid 3@d as invitation|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 2 down if the defence finds the @h ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: none did though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: declarer can make a safety play in hearts to ensure his contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  apparently not|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
nt|richie: @H2 is a clear indication|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hi ck welcome :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lol late in the day|pg||
pc|hA|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and he bid 4nt...this can be a big swing for Italy|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s -you must avoid @s finess -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: yea , its becoming more and more common to respond the opening bid with negative hands , less then 6 points |pg||
nt|richie: I would dbl in south, your hearts are a bit too weak to bid them and you have some alternatives|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S could return the 9@H for @S and then it was -2.|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe the two boards scores will cancel each other out :)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: on deal no 22 jitu & dipak bid 4 @S :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: should play in part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
nt|eliran_a: also x from north here|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, west will bid 4@s, no matter what, north dbl I think |pg||
nt|joemanjo: 6d for the needy?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sure it will CK|pg||
nt|joemanjo: but the unkind break will ensure even 5 will be under the gun|pg||
nt|joemanjo: undo |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@d denies 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess this is the only available game try |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  difficult call by south but he apparently had no problems to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||
nt|doks: very nice fitted hands, but dont see reason 4@S bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a heart lead looks normal|pg||
nt|zebutin: not much competition for 4@S in N/S...making (and might make even overtrick)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I 've great fan of Israel way to play bridge|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But not in this match|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A tough choice for W there|pg||
nt|andyv:  being Greek, I was rooting for Zambia|pg||
nt|richie: only when declarer decides to finesse in @s he may go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: quess to do make/ down -spades finess -or club J -south|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Birman 2@s openening is a good weak 2 8-10 points |pg||
nt|eliran_a: sry only in 1st and 2nd seat . so here its weak 2 6-10|pg||
nt|richie: even in 3rd?|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely they now get 2@H + @H ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: dummy always tables the jack when I lead K from KQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: nothing much for NS here. so the ultra weak preempt may leak some IMPs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now down|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he is young man man so they love attacking leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure he ducked?|pg||

nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i dont like the 1@s replay by west after the double, with such a poor suit|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N will be far easier, but Formidables need more. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
nt|joemanjo: even 4C goes down if @d ruff is found|pg||
pc|c8|nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|c9|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Nice balance by Swapan here... both 1 nt and 2@D shd make|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: how sunil?:)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 1 down here|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 2 more @C tricks & 1 @S :)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||

pc|s4|nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing strong K we lead the Q here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  looks like 2 down vulnerable if they find the @h ruff|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  which they will find, madala is just hesitating between playing hearts rightaway or a minor first|pg||
pc|s5|nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||
