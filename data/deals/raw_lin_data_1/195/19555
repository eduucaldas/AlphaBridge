nt|strike12: can this duck be costly?|pg||
nt|psyck: S can be enplayed to lead @s, & another @s go on 4th @d for an o/t with only 1 more trump loser left|pg||

nt|roswolf: my background is rubber bridge - doubling for blood keeps opps honest - not many guys bid lunatic Weak Jumps against me:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mohitz:  The other QFs are Mah A versus Raj 5, WB green versus Raj 3, TN versus Indian railways|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: if it makes -yes:)|pg||
nt|josj: it sounded like that, your last comment... :)|pg||
nt|josj: and this one too :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice 6@D although 6@H also makes (@C finesse)|pg||
nt|strike12: 1 @d- 10-15 |pg||
nt|dslee: good overcall -|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mohitz:  from what i hear, Rajasthan had 8 teams in the competition|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3 of them qualifying|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, I read it|pg||
nt|dslee: they seem to have clubbed the state champs with this one|pg||
nt|drkvas:  r they the host state?|pg||
nt|dslee: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@D is a good effort|pg||
mb|4H|nt|josj: @C finesse should be wrong here to punish the gamblers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  4@S by EW is down on a club ruff|pg||
nt|dslee: unless @C and @C back , which looks inprobable, 4@S would had made|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but they are locked into the major|pg||
nt|josj: if 3@D is natural, then N made a lazy bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt- probably a bergen - type bid|pg||
nt|josj: ad if S goes on now, they will end up in the inferior 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wonder what 3@S would have meant if short @S N could consider 6@D :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  true that|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|josj: yes, or jacoby, for that matter|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S would have been shortage with me|pg||
nt|josj: no experiments by S...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  how@d lead when in @s a take ur ruff:)|pg||
nt|dslee: on @D lead 3@S is also -1|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|drkvas:  @h lead might have let it make|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|josj: for me too but there are several good approaches after 2nt|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what if West plays a club now?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|josj: simply a mater of agreeing something and bid accordingly|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|dslee: S is thinking whether to play @D or @C :)|pg||

nt|dslee: and there you go|pg||

nt|dslee: now not after the @D indication while giving @C ruff|pg||
nt|drkvas:  on  the auction|pg||
nt|dslee: that was not acceptable :)|pg||
nt|dslee: is there was a @H interest and he knew that he cant ruff, then @C Q was the obvious choice of return|pg||
