pc|cJ|nt|rv: yes PS on this hand, but in slam auctions precision score much better esp after std 2@c opener|pg||
nt|rv: this rates to go down here by a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: i believe the role played by systems in auctions is much less than the role played by players|pg||
nt|rv: what is right line for this 3n, declarer didn't want to use @DA entry to take @c finesse, he decided to play for either T or Q doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|psridhar: just watch Helness and Helgemo -they play a very simple system and reach contracts with high accuracy|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: tis can be beaten 2 now|pg||
nt|rv: even if declarer had used by @DA entry and taken a @c hook and cleared @cs, East could back a second @d and South could get squeezed when West cashes @Ds when in with @sK|pg||
nt|rv: on balance, I think Jitu took a reasonable line, what is your view PS?|pg||

nt|psridhar: interestingly RV -the @d combination is same as what we discussed in earlier 3N ( @c suit then) -RA went to dummy and finessed -succeding!|pg||
nt|rv: fast start by Mah 'A' here, I suspect WB Green will come back strongly and this match will go down to the wire|pg||
nt|psridhar: and it was right to finesse then too -double dummy!|pg||
nt|rv: PS, one difference here in this deal is it is safe to go to dummy unlike in 3n played by Jitu, still it is interesting suit combination|pg||
nt|vugraphzjy: back live|pg||

nt|bobholl: if you finesse @H :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: naturally:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|nt|bobholl: true show up squeeze also works :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|josj: with the D!A Vienna Coup the squeeze would even work against W too :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might easily get to the slam level but choose to play in @C|pg||
nt|josj: @DA|pg||
nt|josj: should be np either if plyed as nt|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: which is a better contract (32 @C is sufficient)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: I THINK THE OTHER ROOM SCORE IS WRONG|pg||
nt|josj: and if 4-1 play it as 6nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely geoffry :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: a spec says 4nt by SOUTH made 10 tricks:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|josj: unlikely as W led @D9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||

nt|psridhar: yes poor hand to open 1N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|psridhar: KQX,Q10X,AQJ9X,XX = better hand for 1N|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Jos and Bob for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: last board|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|josj: another slam and once again not such  good one, worse than the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|josj: blank honour works either way provided you guess correctly which way :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might be bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: both pards showing shortages - great news|pg||
