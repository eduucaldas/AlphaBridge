mb|1S|nt|roswolf: i have a lot of sympathy with 3nt here|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure what NS plays , looks like precision or some form of strong @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Mostly a partials hand - unless NS is too ambitious to reach a @H game which can be taken down in a good EW def|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dslee: No, sorry, think 4@H would always make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dslee: x is 5-7|pg||

mb|p|nt|mohitz:  partner showed 6 odd clubs |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mohit|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|mohitz:  this wll be a quick claim|pg||

pc|s3|nt|bagman: Now declarer has 4 club tricks and entry to cash them. He has 8 tricks ready and can set up a spade for 9th|pg||
nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small heart is most promising for defenders.  maybe W has the ace|pg||

pc|s6|pc|hK|pg||

nt|dslee: this would be a @S partial for EW|pg||
nt|strike12: .|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing standard, the auction might go 1N all pass|pg||
nt|drkvas:  3nt seems to be the favorite destination|pg||
nt|mohitz:  they will open 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, both the sides plays strong @C|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i mead on many deals like 3 4 2 9 etc|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure if they top it by 1NT 15-17|pg||

mb|p|nt|strike12: yes|pg||
nt|drkvas:  i feel if ur playing strong @c 15 17 nt makes no sense|pg||
nt|dslee: Raj 1 has to pull up in next 10, this I guess is gone for them|pg||
nt|drkvas:  u can play 14 15 if u like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  putting up all nt ranges in 1@C hurts during competition|pg||
nt|dslee: no 1NT here from E?|pg||
nt|dslee: N for his pass is assumed to hold a @H length and @S short|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: 3nt by N is best but difficult to reach now ...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n frivilous interference hurts too|pg||
nt|strike12: 1@h is specifically 4 @s so E might wait and watch here|pg||
nt|dslee: since 1@S is opened , they can take off to 4 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks an inevitable 4@H|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|dslee: W comes to rescue|pg||
nt|strike12: :)|pg||
nt|dslee: S has the values for at least one raise now|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@S opening is systemic|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will invite|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and North will reject i guess|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mohitz:  better play not play in NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: maybe N is considering a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: this will be a push too time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|josj: remote...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, east opened 1N all pass|pg||
nt|dslee: would had bid 3@S here if at all|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in NT, defenders can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dslee: not the most obvious lead from W|pg||
mb|3D|nt|drkvas:  i think rajasthans team is an adhoc 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  South might bid 4@S now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: kind of slamtry may be :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: SUBTLE SLAM TRYS are not my cup of tea - capable of misleading pard|pg||

nt|mohitz:  now the small matter of guessing spade Queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|dslee: no chance of going down in traditional play now :)|pg||
nt|dslee: unless N thinks of pulling up some staunts|pg||
nt|mohitz:  what is traditional play?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: this may be finis|pg||

nt|josj: they're just starting it now|pg||
nt|roswolf: upwards and onwards we soar|pg||
nt|dslee: taking the fin is the directions usually taken in practice|pg||
nt|mohitz:  playing West for Queen is better because you can cater to Queen singleton either side that way |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: brakes are needed|pg||

nt|mohitz:  another 4@S that might make|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  2@S is an interesting choice|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dslee: should pass right?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|strike12: yes what would pass and 2@d convey here then?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, it depends on agreements|pg||
nt|dslee: mostly no in this system|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mohitz:  pass, 2@D and or even 2@H makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dslee: desperate - choose your best 3 card|pg||

nt|dslee: some agreements play as 5 4 4 and @D can be passed|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: but a likely push again, simply too difficult|pg||

nt|mohitz:  3@C was the limit for EW and 3@H for NS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: memory tests are not too popular amongst the general mass of players|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Seems as EW have better reason to bid than NS.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West would be happy to defend 1@d X|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: Kasle opens his nonsuit in 3rd hand|pg||

mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: 3Nt i think and it be fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: y:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: now depends how they will use it - not easy|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kemperg: see him in Holland in october?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: He expects that his partner is not on lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2Nt is not my idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: this is a very good spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: what now my love ? |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose West did not X 1@s in the OR becuase he had only 3@h|pg||
nt|josj: but it won't stop there|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hasn't shown his full power|pg||
nt|josj: but E has|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 5 good clubs is enough for W and he is right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2n is 100% in this game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: 2NT shows a good hand as with a (bad) minimum E can pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i suppose you mean 2Nt  gf    but then many play it as extra's|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to work out which of 2@s and 2@d are clearly forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  scope for an accident here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i like ten clear 2NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S sounds natural to me...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but as NS were trying to play in @s, East should work it out|pg||
nt|josj: E can see it, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at another vulnerability, E might think NS have psyched|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 3@C on xxxx is no pancake either :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  30-40 years ago, 1@s was often a psyche|pg||

nt|kemperg: 9 tricks, where to find the 10th?|pg||
nt|ntmon: W perhaps hoped for 5 club tricks but i recommend not to go for miracles|pg||
nt|ntmon: S bid twice - i don't think that's because he has zero count|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at least E might make a trick this way, by ruffing a @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|kemperg: normal 3@D with 4@S's. partner has no opening|pg||

nt|mohitz:  i assume bd 6 is not at the table yet |pg||
nt|strike12: 2h opening byN|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing more than 2@S or 3@H partials|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is a stretch to say the least|pg||
nt|dslee: and fron the wrong hand too|pg||
nt|mohitz:  another partial|pg||
nt|mohitz:  South will likely open a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the bad spade break means that even 3@S is in trouble|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2N can be defeated on good defense|pg||
mb|1D|nt|josj: so Kepri just recorded the biggest swing of the match so far, no less than 4 imps|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if playing in game, i would want to be in 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas:  now tough to find their @s fit |pg||
nt|dslee: S has a decision to make :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@H i guess|pg||
nt|mohitz:  11 imps for the needy as expected|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: multi might generate action|pg||

nt|strike12: S may try a game|pg||
nt|dslee: No :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  interesting|pg||
nt|mohitz:  X likely to be penalty here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: X now 3@C 3nt push :)|pg||
nt|dslee: only penalty|pg||
nt|dslee: nothing else|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: maybe 2nt leb|pg||
nt|drkvas:  true a few good guesses n@s a rt u can land 4@h but not on this lay out|pg||
nt|strike12: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: lebensohl?|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|mohitz:  looks like they play weak NT even in this position|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: yes now difficult to reach 2nt in W :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: penalty axe!?|pg||
nt|josj: just -1...|pg||
nt|josj: but better than -200|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is hands off penalty after a leb 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a swing of 250 anyway :)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|josj: they get bigger and bigger|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i was under the impression it was only when NV|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bobholl: depends on what the maximum for 2NT is but he guesses rigth|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  so, NS will get a heart, 2 clubs and two diamond tricks eventually for -1|pg||
nt|drkvas:  good choice by s bihar on a roll|pg||
nt|dslee: Dr, this was a sitting duck to crack |pg||
nt|mohitz:  declarer needs to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|mohitz:  when in with heart King|pg||
nt|drkvas:  not so clear cut des|pg||
mb|3D|nt|josj: so 6 more to Kepri|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: probably...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  I would have bid 3@H |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a 21hcp count i hate not doubling these contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: X brings 1 extra imp here...|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@D is a good effort|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: @C finesse should be wrong here to punish the gamblers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  4@S by EW is down on a club ruff|pg||
nt|dslee: unless @C and @C back , which looks inprobable, 4@S would had made|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but they are locked into the major|pg||
nt|josj: if 3@D is natural, then N made a lazy bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|mohitz:  1N probably asking bid and 2@D shows diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mohitz:  2@H might be re-ask|pg||
nt|mohitz:  with 2@S showing 4 clubs|pg||
nt|mohitz:  they play relays in GF auctions|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i am not sure about how exactly they work|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: but E has to find 2 discards|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hads thought so jos but he probably isnt|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@H and 2@D to ew i see|pg||
nt|josj: DD that is...|pg||

nt|josj: endplay is broken up|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup good defensive play|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but South's 2@S seems to show 4 clubs|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 1S opening and 1NT in E maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: hello|pg||
nt|ntmon: @C lead indicates uneven split - if not a probable singleton, so time to work on @S|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D making surely good for NS|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|bagman: 1NT or pass?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bagman: bad hand, some fit, nonvulnerable; generally right to bid, though|pg||
nt|007 joosth: if W is strong with hearts  E has big hand, so I like 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pass can't be right when opponents are vul!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|bagman: Yes, and if you get 3@D in response, you just hope for the best|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@C playable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: even - as we could see - wrong sided in this particular case|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: N tells his strong hand with spades I suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this ahnd is agreat example of that very fact|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even 5D it seems|pg||
nt|bagman: E tempted to bid but does not want to see the opps bid to game|pg||
nt|bagman: E has practically no defense|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: should anyone have bid 4D?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4NT is fine judgment, slam is shaky|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|007 joosth: maybe N i think|pg||
nt|bagman: probably, but they are in 3@D now and declarer is likely to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is a good signalling situation..If e wanted a spade shift he would play the club J denying the queen|pg||

pc|dA|nt|josj: is the score on  board 8 correct, operator?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bagman: When EW bid up to 3 level on marginal values they often have 9 trumps; this information often helps the opponents to estimate the level of fit|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Strong club may get them to the cold 7@D|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: lead now 55 IMPs for IR, fairly sizeable though we have 2 more segments to play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|rv: yes strong @c systems facilitate bidding these hands where one hand is very strong, std 2@c does pre-empt auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: E will be shown up...|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you finesse @H :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: less room after opening 2@c in std|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: naturally:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even with diamonds 4-0 you want to be in the grand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: It makes it complicated, but still with chances|pg||
nt|rv: I presume2@c by North is conventional showing bal hand 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: true show up squeeze also works :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: I don't know what 3NT is. I would have bid 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: with the D!A Vienna Coup the squeeze would even work against W too :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might easily get to the slam level but choose to play in @C|pg||
nt|josj: @DA|pg||
nt|josj: should be np either if plyed as nt|pg||
nt|josj: a|pg||
nt|rv: I would have passed with North instead of bidding 3n, if South had redoubled showing first round control, then 3@s would have been perfect|pg||
nt|mohitz:  these guys play a relay based system |pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: or passing even as rv suggests|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3@H was likely a relay asking shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: which is a better contract (32 @C is sufficient)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: I THINK THE OTHER ROOM SCORE IS WRONG|pg||
nt|josj: and if 4-1 play it as 6nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely geoffry :)|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mohit fine|pg||
mb|6D|nt|roswolf: a spec says 4nt by SOUTH made 10 tricks:)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|ntmon: NT contract better by N, 6@C hinges on @C suit, with slight possibility of @D ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzjb: last board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: this could be another swing for IR if Manas-Amarnath get to 3n instead of 4@s in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|josj: another slam and once again not such  good one, worse than the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pulling 3NT seems strange. He did bid his spades three times before that|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: yes Roland|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: And he has excellent cards for notrump after that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes @DQ is a gold card and 2 outside kings|pg||
