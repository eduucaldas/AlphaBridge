nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3Nt i think and it be fast|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kemperg: see him in Holland in october?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|josj: this is a very good spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: what now my love ? |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose West did not X 1@s in the OR becuase he had only 3@h|pg||
nt|josj: but it won't stop there|pg||
nt|bobholl: he hasn't shown his full power|pg||
nt|josj: but E has|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 5 good clubs is enough for W and he is right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2n is 100% in this game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: 2NT shows a good hand as with a (bad) minimum E can pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i suppose you mean 2Nt  gf    but then many play it as extra's|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to work out which of 2@s and 2@d are clearly forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  scope for an accident here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i like ten clear 2NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S sounds natural to me...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but as NS were trying to play in @s, East should work it out|pg||
nt|josj: E can see it, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at another vulnerability, E might think NS have psyched|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 3@C on xxxx is no pancake either :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  30-40 years ago, 1@s was often a psyche|pg||

nt|ntmon: W perhaps hoped for 5 club tricks but i recommend not to go for miracles|pg||
nt|ntmon: S bid twice - i don't think that's because he has zero count|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  at least E might make a trick this way, by ruffing a @d|pg||

nt|dslee: and fron the wrong hand too|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!h & minor, less than opening|nt|josj: so Kepri just recorded the biggest swing of the match so far, no less than 4 imps|pg||

nt|roswolf: penalty axe!?|pg||
nt|josj: just -1...|pg||
nt|josj: but better than -200|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl is hands off penalty after a leb 2nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a swing of 250 anyway :)|pg||
nt|josj: sure|pg||
nt|josj: they get bigger and bigger|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|bobholl: depends on what the maximum for 2NT is but he guesses rigth|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, NS will get a heart, 2 clubs and two diamond tricks eventually for -1|pg||
nt|drkvas:  good choice by s bihar on a roll|pg||
