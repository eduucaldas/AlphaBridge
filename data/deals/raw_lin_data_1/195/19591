nt|jcwla: Many IMPs are lost by those who "compensate" for their underweight earlier actions by making non-systemic auction-ending passes later.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S didn't open on 11 eventually gained 2 imps for his side|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well it is not like there are not potential losses from failing to identify a 5-bagger major.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  there must by some system glich for W not to be able to show a weak hand with the majors|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S will run to 3@c...then the fun should begin|pg||
nt|jcwla: And end - with 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doesnt N have a michaels bid or something?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E better that a 2@S raise 3 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nope, both of us are wrong|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, my prediction was conditional upon yours.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|kiwibridge: EW only reached 3@S so just 1 imp|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok, so the run was to 4@c...I was just premature|pg||
nt|kemperg: no transfers on weak 1NT and no Stayman relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  but also some form of bergen |pg||
nt|panosk: N has a 2@H bid i think|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: why not 2 @S? |pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: michaels |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we call ours Truscott in Acol 1@S-3@S = good raise to 2|pg||

nt|rnmalik: I am somehow not a fan of opening NT with 5 major. 3NT makes 9 tricks but 4@H a superior contract.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: thanks, it works very well, of course as we play 4 card majors it guaranteed 4 card support|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: S has a nice hand in context of the X  -- arguably didn't give pd a lot of leeway but possibly N could show 2-suiter instead?|pg||
