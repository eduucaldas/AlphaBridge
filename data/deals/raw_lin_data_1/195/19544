nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like a Support Double - I have three spades, partner|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@H should be the contract|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: There is no EW CC, so 1@D is alerted either being 3+ or some kind of strong @C|pg||

nt|mdgraham: might have bid 2NT the first time|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Maybe 1@D could be (very) short and 2NT to South should show minors.|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ? regulations?|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: alerting regulations, if possible with less then 14 you should alert.|pg||

nt|Vugraph814: man even|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Same in the Netherlands BTW.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|Vugraph814: NS play strong @C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The day your National body says you can't open (a bid) without x points is the day you should give up bridge, I reckon|pg||
nt|friggi: so this is 11-15 min 2@D?|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Sry for the misunderstanding. In Sweden almost everything is allowed actually. I know no country with so much freedom in bidding.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|mdgraham: my fault, probably. No worries.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT looks like either a minor suit transfer (please bid 3@c) or a diamond transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...or maybe not......|pg||
nt|friggi: @D tranfer makes sense|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: East is trying to correct his partner's failure to alert.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sverjohn: 2@c dont? 2NT intedended as leb?|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Most likely but not clear, sry.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://db.svenskbridge.se/info/s90-55.htm|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|5|nt|mdgraham: one reasonable method is to use system-on, with double saying "I would have bid that" - so double by East here would be Stayman   |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a bigt round for NS!|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - kind of a disaster for W/E|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: EW remain, NS will be Johan Gr√∂nkvist and Brehmer|pg||
nt|friggi: a bit strange to have that kind of a system failure|pg||
nt|friggi: at this level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so here, if North had bid 2@d, double would be a transfer to 2@h, and a 2@h bid would be a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might not be the best method, but it saves on memory strain|pg||
