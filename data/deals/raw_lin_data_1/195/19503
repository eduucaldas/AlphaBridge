mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: then opening :)|pg||
nt|frankbo: now we are talking|pg||
nt|frankbo: def 1N opening|pg||
nt|le joker: only 2@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: precision'|pg||
nt|bebechira: indeed.. fav vulnerability as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was surprised E didnt take the save |pg||

nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||

nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 1@c be the opening then? |pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi 12.5 VP przed Izraelem, wiêc punkty id¹ "podwójnie", a nawet "poczwórnie", bo to walka o z³oto|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bcmandal: 3s+1d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
nt|daman: he can claim 7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko ¿e teraz mo¿e powstaæ poszum...na szczêcie nie|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bebechira: but W in 5c dbled in the open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: 23 of @H are too low :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and maybe the coaches have talked about "wildness" |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: S would be careful in discards to save the @S.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|leao:  difficult for him to conduct the auction... pard mite have had a pressure bid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|frankbo: trange way to play|pg||
nt|veistikke:  ok :P Inn norway most dont open 1nt with 5 card major. (some do) I mean its not the best option :P|pg||
nt|frankbo: strange|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: EW need to shift in @C quickly to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: can only be profitable for israel|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to lose 2H unless play 9|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
nt|serhat: on a D lead 4H can make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||

nt|mich-b: @D KQJ in the overcaller's suit , are not pulling their weight|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 points + 5 @S just enough according to the rule of 15|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has a great collection of small cards|pg||
nt|bebechira: a trip to Cuba is a great incentive for good bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Jansma is wrong to bid 4N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Show spades first, then support diamonds later if needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: which is  probably as high as they should be |pg||
nt|rnmalik: This was battle of nerves:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  what are we learning from last bd? If u play vs an opponent who might double you only for the reason that you go into 4@c. Stay where u are.|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is time to go over every hand |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Can N find the @h10?|pg||
nt|athene: east might have dropped the @SJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: suggesting spade shortagein his hand and hence more heart length|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is FG against the strong hand(if she has the strong one)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow other tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|eugenio123: good bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: trump lead seems to be normal|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends on cashing @D tricks.|pg||
nt|chrisky: ew too high|pg||
nt|riccho:  both teams are getting in two-digit-imps mode here again|pg||
nt|daman: I think EW can make 4 @H  even with the 4-1 break|pg||

pc|s5|nt|yuval10: South, of the other hand, can already be considered "Veteran". Ida Gronkvist is playing for Sweden in the European Championship for the 3rd time|pg||
