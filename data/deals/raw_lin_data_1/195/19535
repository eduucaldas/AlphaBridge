nt|panja: ok, that explains it, it would be too early for you in India...in NY, just the right time of the day to be awake|pg||
nt|panja: good 2@S intervention...|pg||
nt|panja: it would have been tough for East to get in...2@H looks like a make unless @D is led|pg||
nt|nkgupt: quite a preballance for one imp|pg||
pc|c8|nt|thak: should make 9 tricks, cover the 1 IMP deficit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|panja: of course with a stiff @H....West does not really have a case for a 2@S bid...E could come up with @HKJTx for all he knows...and 2 Spades and 2443, and 2@S could go for a number|pg||

nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||

nt|sybarra: hello  all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the contract was 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3@S may be passed and would be a good board for NL.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
nt|leao:  stiff ace claimed its toll|pg||

nt|thak: but all games by NS doomed to failure |pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||

mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: I agree and learnt at very late stage:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the count in the @C immediately known after trick one|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 2@c of course show majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: 0708 in Washington DC |pg||
nt|riccho:  hi shirley :) |pg||
nt|leao:  i like 5@h|pg||
nt|thak: one of the popular treatments here is to play 2N/3x as constructive with 2@S being a start of signoff sequence|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||

nt|frankbo: ?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: then opening :)|pg||
nt|frankbo: now we are talking|pg||
nt|frankbo: def 1N opening|pg||
nt|le joker: only 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i am so used with precisin that i cant imagine @H opening with 19 pts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: precision'|pg||
nt|bebechira: indeed.. fav vulnerability as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was surprised E didnt take the save |pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: ah thats trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not that easy to be reach..|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||

nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||
nt|figo: imaginative lead this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Bob |pg||
pc|s7|nt|bcmandal: 2s+1d|pg||
nt|bebechira: this must have been the reason|pg||

nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 1@c be the opening then? |pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi 12.5 VP przed Izraelem, wiêc punkty id¹ "podwójnie", a nawet "poczwórnie", bo to walka o z³oto|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bcmandal: 3s+1d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
nt|daman: he can claim 7|pg||
nt|figo: though with entries in W hand , S x was also ok|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko ¿e teraz mo¿e powstaæ poszum...na szczêcie nie|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bebechira: but W in 5c dbled in the open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: 23 of @H are too low :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and maybe the coaches have talked about "wildness" |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: S would be careful in discards to save the @S.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|leao:  difficult for him to conduct the auction... pard mite have had a pressure bid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s4|nt|frankbo: trange way to play|pg||
nt|veistikke:  ok :P Inn norway most dont open 1nt with 5 card major. (some do) I mean its not the best option :P|pg||
nt|frankbo: strange|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like he is home now |pg||
nt|riccho:  but after 2times non-club play N has enought tricks |pg||

pc|s8|nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||

mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey|pg||
nt|sybarra: but does get the hand across in one bid |pg||

nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe the 6@H slam is on his mind|pg||
nt|daman: this would be awful if the bid slam and went down|pg||
nt|daman: they*|pg||
nt|leao:  yep. very bad for morale|pg||
nt|leao:  and at the onset of the match too|pg||
nt|sybarra: watched their big brothers on the jr team |pg||
nt|bobholl: brave bidding is rewarded :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: and let's be fair it surely is in the 50% RANGE|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Rimstedt twins signed off in 4h... good chance for Israel|pg||
nt|figo: EW play transfer +ve methods|pg||

pc|c5|nt|leao:  argh|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey |pg||
nt|serhat: hi Champ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  so they start with a 20+ IMP deficit to recover|pg||
nt|leao:  have a nice one|pg||
nt|leao:  sandwich, i mean|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play clubs or Hearts knowing Spade Q is a possible entry|pg||

nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||

pc|s6|nt|panosk: shud also be carefull of clubs as he/she knows that S is 5-4 at aleast hence no more than 3-4 cards in rest suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||

nt|leao:  4@h seems cold for EW here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand is much more unbalanced than a typical weak jump(i.e. may be too strong)|pg||

nt|bebechira: they defeated 3h... so no chance for a significant swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in OR  west underled the ace of @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: EW need to shift in @C quickly to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: can only be profitable for israel|pg||
pc|d3|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to lose 2H unless play 9|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thak: for some of the players E is a reasonable cue raise, but W's hand doesn't qualify for overcall|pg||

pc|s4|nt|panja: East has 8 HCP..and a flat 4333 hand..he should just be bidding 2@S..|pg||

mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: witam|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT gamling - one of the worst conventions ever invented IMO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S A as recommended defense.|pg||
nt|frankaus: u lead ur top card view dummy will always set it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: or @D Ace.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h needs finess only about so near 50%|pg||
nt|bebechira: the twins in 4h in the open room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||
nt|pinticus: so it is 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H diff to make imagine E trying for highet as he shud|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
nt|suketbombi: needs to get @HS right in any slam they bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
nt|serhat: on a D lead 4H can make|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: wg tablicy, ktora mam przed soba jest 10-8 dla naszych|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: po 5 impow w niewpisanych rozdaniach wzieli|pg||

nt|bebechira: can SHE make?|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@D i 2NT - obie odzywki na pewno z fitem kier...która co oznacza? mamy to ustalone?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
nt|pinticus: 4@s OR EW|pg||
nt|saverio: this is good (if N thinks he made enough) since they are missing a cold 4@s|pg||
nt|garden2005: dobry wieczór wszystkim :)|pg||
nt|le joker: @c lead go down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||
nt|sybarra: ideal bid would be 4 @D as cue and spade raise, (on the way to game) |pg||
nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||
nt|leao:  interesting to see if Ginossar will duck the @c lead... mite make life hard for declarer|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|riccho:  the reason for doubling is misterious to me|pg||
nt|daman: not really|pg||
nt|daman: make 5 then|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: 4@c was alert bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: since we know the cards 6@H & 6 Nt will be far superior than 6@C other things being equal does not need @C break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the strain here is right but the level is wrog but who knows the luck may smile at them with 13 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: anamd will not bother much about the % in slam will bang ace and back @H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||
nt|riccho:  dont understand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||
nt|sybarra: record would have fallen Richard|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is a useful convention here: XX here from E would show doubt about the contract |pg||
nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||

pc|s5|nt|psyck: heading for 3@s, 1@h, 3@d, 2@c tricks maybe|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2 down again |pg||
nt|loe48: well. as we see this contract has no chanse as both sides overbid their hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: 1 h, 2 d and 1c looks obvious|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If E plays @DK first then 6.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much eaiser to bid and make slams from the vantage point |pg||

nt|nkgupt: rather 2 more|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: nothing else than dbl seems to be the right option....|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|panja: only poblem though is the variability of Nt opening...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panja: like we saw on B19....if E came up with @CAKQxx and !KQxx, say...and an honour somewhere in Majors...3@H would roll|pg||
nt|panja: @DKQxx even|pg||
nt|nkgupt: and after X he will not be able to see w/ that ...that it can not be right to defend ? :)|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt is a middle of the road bid....although the road isn't finished well over there...|pg||

nt|bobholl: she starts the same way as the other room|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale po bloku kolor blotkowy + stoper trudny do licytacji, co trzeba wybraæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I might play it there,  can he cu 3 @S? |pg||

nt|eugenio123: pay attention at this board, very nice distribution|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: ciezko powiedziec do czego tutaj dojdzie|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: pewnie EW wybierze sie w 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bulgaria needs to "right the ship"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like a funky multi |pg||
nt|sybarra: very instructive,  both E open 1 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not some crazy preempt |pg||
mb|1N|nt|dzeronimo: ewentualnie NS w obrone|pg||
nt|eugenio123: were they swopping? lol    at the end 10 tricks|pg||
nt|saverio: 4@s for NS here|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly it is just one of those magic hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h must show  values and a super @d-fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he bid 1 nt, (2 suited presumably)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: that why I would be nervous |pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may play 4 sp |pg||
nt|bebechira: south has a hand to double some  high contract for sure|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lotte will bid 5c and the double will come.... but not enough to match 910|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they make +1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question is did W promise 5 @S? |pg||
nt|bobholl: just losing 1@S and 1C not that difficult|pg||
nt|jkotor: absurdalne 1BA IMO|pg||
nt|jkotor: oba stare i 18|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: 2@s show 5@h gf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should have overcalled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 10 tricks ye|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C should make.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eugenio123: it's hard to bid game|pg||
nt|sybarra: need great agreements for that bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: fit bid?|pg||
nt|frankbo: well u need D 3-3 to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 5?|pg||
nt|le joker: xD|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a club ruff in 4 @S? |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol true|pg||
nt|bobholl: still a support X ??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to me, no comment is trivial, so thanks all|pg||
nt|tlc: 3@h being a splinter, obviously promising no extra values|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@H splinter raise in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: both 5d and 3nt can be doomed|pg||
nt|yuval10: W has a decision now|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she decide to go for it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt has np|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3NT very gd score in open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: best lead is @h ,but you dont have any|pg||
nt|frankbo: 7NT|pg||
nt|le joker: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|loe48: this hand again is almost to good for a weak 2 opener, rather 1s-2s hand|pg||
nt|saverio: since they bid usually 1 or 2 tricks more it shouldnt be difficult for them to get there :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to click pass....but i should :(|pg||
nt|riccho:  oh well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass, I think dbl would've been better by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better never than late :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: olè another dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: E could help them :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead would make it difficult and is marked.|pg||
nt|redds: witam wszystkich|pg||
nt|panosk: the Q@D was led and N was trying to find pards values , S discarded loe @D and a spade was returned|pg||
nt|panosk: *low|pg||
nt|riccho:  now its getting silly|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok guys,  we need to get the system notes in the right order! |pg||
nt|veistikke:  what is south thinking about? :S|pg||
nt|le joker: i think it's W|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we said, the OR score would not be duplicated |pg||
nt|figo: 9 out of 10 players in this finals are non smokers |pg||
nt|figo: Samant 's hand better than RA's :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|antoniz: czeæ:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam Wojtka Gaw³a Akademickiego mistrza wiata...zast¹pi mnie do koñca tego meczu|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3kier z x by³o bardzo kosztowne|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: ofc its W :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :P|pg||
nt|suketbombi: disaster |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear must play in @c|pg||
nt|tlc: unfortunbately the splinter caused west to bid 3NT after the heart wastage was shown...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|possessed: i am sorry 5dia seems cold, as only one diamond with east|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a @C lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer may just play ace and a club |pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead should have been interesting.|pg||
nt|panosk: dont be deaf in pards signals they are very helpfull some times :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: i zbyt silna rêka i stoper karo z którym nie wa¿ne kto zajmie BA|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@c pewnie jaki puppet|pg||
nt|suketbombi: have to find @HK in 6@C but 5 is no problem at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  a not great 3N that makes when both majors (and @d) split nicelay And the !k is onside|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Normaly she would bid first round|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: wydaje mi sie troche za ostre 3@s Witkowskiego|pg||
nt|sybarra: E opened the hand it the other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the hungarian comentator at the open room feels ashamed i ve heard :)|pg||
nt|le joker: ....|pg||
nt|le joker: be careful|pg||
nt|veistikke:  5!n?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bob.. you did not answer to your question.... still a support double?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: she decided to trhow 7 @c |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I understand with 64 and 11|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite natural considering the fact it's teams and they're red|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But N will have good overcalls :)|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: ten wist z pewnoscia ulatwi gre rozgrywajacemu|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chcia³by Ciê widzieæ na jego miejscu licytuj¹cego md³awe 3@h|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: mo¿e proste 4@h :) ?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e, ale renons+ 3 asy korc¹|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has to be careful to part with QJ of @S.|pg||
nt|panosk: not always of course :) as we know beter his cards :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: popularne w juniorach trochê szkolonych: 2@c zwyk³y stayman, 3@c GF z pytaniem o starsze 5ki|pg||
nt|jkotor: choæ ja sobie nie bardzo wyobra¿am wchodzenie 1BA ze starsz¹ 5k¹ po 1@d|pg||
nt|lechcold: bo ja wiem? dwa zatrzymania karowe...a jeli 18PC nie bêdzie dla partnera niespodziank¹, to móg³bym z tym 1BA ¿yæ|pg||
nt|jkotor: tiaa, spasuje na 7 z czwórk¹ star¹|pg||
nt|jkotor: rewelacja|pg||
nt|lechcold: w  9 jest du¿o punktów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: zbrodnicze otwarcie 1@s :), antypiki i strasznie brzydka 11ka|pg||
nt|jkotor: chyba, ¿e w ka¿de 10 otwieraj¹ obowi¹zkowo, jak Jassem i Martens przed parti¹|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: I think they're joking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: W is thinking|pg||
nt|saverio: to XX ?|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i dont know|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ parê lat znam tych dzieciaków, ale mam wra¿enie, ¿e zsuwaj¹ siê w dziedzinie bilansu prostego|pg||
nt|daman: this seems like a routine contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C X can go down by @C lead and duck the @S 2 times|pg||
nt|bebechira: another coffee hand... |pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a comedic auction esp the 1@d and 1NT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: and it looks natural to lead @d from N in that bidding|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  seems like an easy game|pg||
nt|le joker: aie !!|pg||
nt|le joker: 13 IMPS pour Netherland !|pg||
nt|veistikke:  :D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: oui :)|pg||
nt|frankbo: i wonder what 5N eas|pg||
nt|frankbo: was|pg||
nt|le joker: 1@s pass 7NT ! please...|pg||
nt|le joker: asking for 6 or 7|pg||
nt|bebechira: even if it was... with 5 hearts it is hard to resist a pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 4 @S is on ice |pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know the answer guess is i want to bid on :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: even with @C ruff |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...thx Bob|pg||
nt|antoniz: bêdzie trudno o 9-t¹ lewê|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|redds: i rewolwerowe otwarcie Wojtka wybilo przeciwnikow z 4@S|pg||
nt|riccho:  szalay? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: dont know|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb  I will check|pg||
nt|leao:  one more juicy chunk of IMPs going Israel's way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: to be honest 7NT is not a good contract .....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bebechira: clubs behave so easy 9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|timverbeek:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  back to 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: not so easy now...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: anand will ask home may @S soon|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: but declarer will finesse the J@h and the @h's are 3-3|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hard for east to decide|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  interesting lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: EW maybe push them to bid game|pg||
nt|eugenio123: finally they found their fit on 4th level|pg||
nt|antoniz: mieli realn¹ szansê na kontrakt 4pik,ale szalone 2karo zaprowadzi³o do 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: a good controlled pass by W|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: of course he might just cash four rounds of diamonds first to see what happens|pg||
nt|raghavan: under cut?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: he knows @h44 now if @h7 lead was 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: szalay is there |pg||
nt|veistikke:  6 is :P|pg||
pc|s5|nt|timverbeek:  now declarer is in big danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 9 was the winning play |pg||
nt|riccho:  sounded like him|pg||
nt|jkotor: Zobaczymy, czy S nie bêdzie "nasiniêty" i czy 9 karo co nie nam¹ci|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: they needed to double hook the @H to make    |pg||
pc|sK|nt|pinticus: no,seems 1off with best defence|pg||
nt|jkotor: "naciniêty"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: assuming he trusts opps|pg||
nt|loe48: 10 or 11 all depends on declearer choose to double finesse spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|antoniz: jestem:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that entry was worth it |pg||
nt|antoniz: trzy razy piki i karo ze sto³u i 9 lew|pg||
nt|jkotor: mo¿liwoci wpustkowe na wszystkie kolory poza pikami, ale chyba naj³atwiej tak jak mówisz|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|saverio: 1off requires a @c guess|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's ieasier -2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: and best declearer play|pg||
nt|saverio: and a perfect timing|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dzeronimo: czesto w takich aukcjach pojawia sie problem niewiedzy partnera z czym daj¹ splintera. i tutaj hacze troche o problem fundamentalny, bo patrzac na przeszlosc przydalyby sie drobne ...|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: obozy przed najwazniejszymi zawodami rozwiazujace takie problemy, bo nikt prawie juz nie pracuja u nas z mlodzieza...|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: a swiat idzie do przodu co widac po wynikach kazdej wazniejszej imprezy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|timverbeek:  now its over|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even in the open room 3 of @D was led which keeps the cumminication intact.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: an imp is comming :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: S bêdzie musia³ podarowaæ treflowe dojcie do sto³u|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|saverio: -2 more likely|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think so|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|nt|bebechira: looks like 12 for the Israelis|pg||
nt|bebechira: Reiter will make more tricks here I think|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: true:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: yeah :(:(|pg||
nt|bebechira: i know.... :(... |pg||
nt|sybarra: a luxury in the auction in the other room |pg||
nt|jkotor: S chyba zagra³ za szybko, mia³ prawie wszystkie punkty widoczne|pg||
nt|lechcold: ta dama karo troszkê nieostro¿na (bo widaæ, ¿e partner prawie na pewno ma singla), ale nie by³o widaæ bezpeczniejszego odejcia|pg||
nt|jkotor: i trzeba by³o pasywnie w pika|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be not..|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bad played|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the cards were flying sry |pg||
nt|bebechira: or yes... lol... 2 more imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: somehow made 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|henryb:  Sweden beating PRK 1-0; Sharapova and Kvitova on serve in first set|pg||
nt|psyck: oops, both throwing @s not a good idea|pg||
nt|daman: they will take the money and run now    +630|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: we will be back after 15 mins.till then bye all|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale wtedy 9@s daje drugi dolot do sto³u i praktycznie to samo|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eugenio123: but very lucky , @d finesse could make her pay|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with this dummy I would hope declarer makes a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: tomorrow we will be back for semi finals at 10 a.m IST,till then bye all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|saverio: now can even be -3|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie wiem, czy przypadkiem odejcie ma³ym treflem nie by³o jedynym k³ad¹cym|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale czy to siê da³o wymyliæ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: a nie bêdzie S "zduszony" w koñcówce?|pg||
nt|antoniz: po ma³ym treflu te¿ swoje|pg||
nt|antoniz: As trefl jest zlokalizowany|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie wiem, trzeba by Deep Finesse zapytaæ:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e kto  z kibiców to zrobi|pg||
nt|jkotor: bardzo ³adnie kibic mi podpowiada, ¿e w praktyce blotka karo w lewie 3 jest bardzo grona|pg||
nt|jkotor: W mo¿e zagraæ na singlowy honor u N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|timverbeek:  so think I would help her|pg||
nt|jkotor: na drugim stole abstrakcyjna licytacja|pg||
nt|jkotor: pas od W to albo misclick, albo straszny wir, który partnerka uratowa³a|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure about the A@h...N could very well had TXX @h|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  think low diamond is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze Piotrek, dobrze...ja o tym tr¹biê od wielu lat|pg||
nt|sybarra: little interference of significance|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be Schols dble was not penalty in the other room|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panosk: double followed by a suit means strong hand with long this suit, so 3@H was chatter|pg||
mc|8|nt|jkotor: ale brawo za wynik, +600 i nie ma o co dalej pytaæ|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  still declarer can go to the table|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and take a heart finesse|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: oczekiwany zysk wpadl w 8 rozdaniu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a gift:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: true|pg||
nt|antoniz: mo¿e 7karo|pg||
nt|sybarra: responsive? or support? |pg||
nt|bebechira: but .... i think Lotte had an 8 card suit ... very rare to get hold of them.... she shoud want to play that.. but this is me|pg||
nt|sybarra: as Ro,land would say,  "what do you call an 8 cards suit?"   Answer:  Trumps!|pg||
nt|bebechira: np Grozio... you are doing great|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was up to E I feel, to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they @D is ambiguous hence Anand was clueless on 3@H|pg||
nt|tlc: i tend to think looking at a stiff spade, perhaps 3NT was ill advised|pg||
nt|figo: actually , they impact a lot , more than we realise |pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: would not have expected S to have found an opening|pg||
nt|loe48: see this hand compared to previous one|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: powodzenia Koledzy - idê na bliskie spotkanie z poslk¹ s³u¿b¹ zdrowia...testament jest w szufladzie:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  so we are still below the 10imp-a-board-mark. But not far below...|pg||
nt|sybarra: what I told, the 3 @S showed wk spades,  but my question is why not support hts? |pg||
nt|daman: since N had pitched all of the @Cs    the @H finesse was free|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not enough obviously |pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: bleah I hate 2suiter with theese cards|pg||
nt|z_lasu: at other table not the best play of 5@d and looks like -2 (here 4@d = )|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: an action now|pg||
nt|bebechira: when I get 8 baggers or 6/6 i play not them ususaly|pg||
nt|figo: some ' glamorous ' contract possible here |pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: now e is in trouble|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam deal for EW|pg||
nt|bobholl: after pard doubles 3@H looks like penalty |pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: S to fight a bit but the rest is next board|pg||
nt|eugenio123: very bad play I think|pg||
nt|antoniz: wracaj szybko:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H.|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H is ok here|pg||
nt|jkotor: ju¿ 2@s nie idzie tak jak karty le¿¹|pg||
nt|bebechira: i know the feeling when the cards are flying everywhere... not easy for sure|pg||
nt|suketbombi: true should bid 3@S 3nt is decleration of huge watage in @H and West overlooked the waiting 3@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: the previous hand was better than this hand is|pg||
nt|redds: trzymaj sie Rysiu :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: kibice melduj¹, ¿e ma³e trefl w trzeciej lewie k³ad³o jednak|pg||
nt|serhat: 5h also makes here.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: ideal hand for their system|pg||
nt|loe48: as you can not count full value of king of spade stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: S pewnie zainwituje tutaj|pg||
nt|bebechira: nicely quoting Roland, Shirley....bang on the money|pg||
nt|bebechira: Reiter pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: he did|pg||
nt|tlc: partner liked had 9 cards in the minors for the auction so far, which didnt leave a lot of room for spades in his hand either|pg||
nt|tlc: likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: and I guess 3@s is forcing so W will invent something|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 nt from E|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  or?|pg||
nt|antoniz: nielicytowalne|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D as well.|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6nt also..|pg||
nt|sybarra: was going to say  6 mt aslo |pg||
nt|sybarra: *6nt |pg||
nt|runnerup: 7@h goes down /@d ruff but 7nt makes --7@h -7 looks better than finess -perhaps some 75%|pg||
nt|figo: 4H bid well timed |pg||
pc|hA|nt|timverbeek:  think 3NT on the first bid, but still @DQx is scary|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: nie, zlapal byka za rogi od razu|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Souths magic hand |pg||
nt|panosk: shud bid 3@S South|pg||
nt|runnerup: in this secvense even better |pg||
nt|raghavan: Cue has started |pg||
nt|tlc: 3@S would be my choice as well|pg||
nt|figo: wont take too long |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: I hope he didnt think a)  3 sp forcing or b) pard could read his mind re 4 @H in his hand |pg||

nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||
nt|loe48: and the hand is not worth more imo|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey Grozio :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: your countrymates need some support :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: in the other room also,  they used 2 @H as negative bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 10 the other way!!|pg||
nt|riccho:  sry IÂ´m head shaking|pg||

nt|bebechira: Poland loosing to France and Israel leading here (not that they will win) ..things are interesting at the top|pg||
nt|jkotor: ³adnie m³odzi dali szansê przeciwnikom na b³¹d, moja propozycja prowadzi³a jedynie do -2 :P|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes Serhat lool|pg||
nt|bebechira: when they score he will say very quietly +170|pg||
nt|serhat: they might even have a little argument before they realise 5h and 5d makes|pg||
nt|bebechira: and after +400 a smile will come up on his face... |pg||
nt|figo: last board worth keeping an eye on , when it comes up in OR|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
nt|loe48: open 1h helped opponents to win 4s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: ohh she take it back :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I do my best|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: W³oszki niespodziewanie (zza wêg³a jak to okreli³ jeden z kibiców) mog¹ zdobyæ br¹z - maj¹ ju¿ "tylko" 6 VP straty do Szwedek i 2 VP do Francuzek|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h seems ok -just careful play needed |pg||
nt|sybarra: dropped down to 9.5 per bd|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: this hand may help if the French go too high|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, bd 11 is missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would need valium for coaching here |pg||
nt|jkotor: co otwieramy w robrze z N?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a simple path to 4@S then|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 6!6=|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: @H|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: S juz to mogl wygrac przebijajac 2 kara ze stolu co postawiloby W w przymusie|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I suggest 2@h by south|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3karo|pg||
nt|figo: transfer +ve they play|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
nt|tlc: making 5 with any normal line of p[lay|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
nt|veistikke:  got a feeling of 3!nt inn S|pg||
nt|jkotor: sporo kart w starych|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale 1@d wykluczam, tam jest mo¿e 8-9 PC|pg||
nt|serhat: N should bid definately last hand. dbl or 4h both fine for me as he has D tolerans|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
nt|jkotor: a co s¹dzimy o Pasie?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|4D|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
nt|bobholl: what to bid as S i almost have pity with S :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot... incredible|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would worry  p would raise hts|pg||
nt|figo: looks like some ssytem modification recently , earlier this 3D was 5422 |pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead in the OR |pg||
mb|4N|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
nt|antoniz: jednak trochê blokuje przeciwników i partner wie gdzie jestemy|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next please :)|pg||
nt|tlc: dont you wish someone could just tell declarer that :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland is not getting too much cricket.. bad weather in London|pg||
nt|serhat: 1h=@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  "can|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: czy to Silna Grupa Pod Wezwaniem?|pg||
nt|mareczek: witajcie :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: and bidding 1@D has already shown weak hand.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good switch.|pg||
nt|leao:  Peter, our operator tells us that 3@s is a moderate hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: the important test England-India will be affected by the english weather|pg||
nt|figo: a cakewalk|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hi:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe N should have won ht and returned a @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they are discussing something in dutch :(|pg||
nt|panosk: that makes 4@H even more wrong choice|pg||
nt|leao:  first major swing for england, well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is a lot of brain power being used!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol Shirley.... whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you say phew|pg||
nt|bebechira: we do indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: coffee biard now|pg||

nt|serhat: Sweeden easyly could go up to 2nd position after this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh:  break.......1min|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Instead of 2D should bid 2H to show 3cd supposrt and not game seeking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: Poland is now up in a comfertable lead, and not undeserved by play|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, but I can't see what declarer was playing for|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: neither do i |pg||

nt|sybarra: speaking of dutch,  I wonder what the difference is in the ending of their names,  beek vs beeke |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: have no ideq|pg||
nt|panosk: a bit of arguing -not a lot though- keeps pard awake:) no harm there |pg||
nt|riccho:  Do u think there is junior someqhere who would pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|riccho:  there it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yes|pg||

mb|1C|nt|loe48: a lucky 6c made in start may have stunned the opponents|pg||
nt|cicus: she|pg||
nt|cicus: a bold 2NT now by W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s from N should be interesting...will E find the A@h lead and continuation?|pg||
nt|serhat: but 32-32 is not good for them|pg||
nt|tlc: the question on this hand is whether E just shoots out 3NT or invites...with that good a club suit i thk i';d just bid 3 and hope for the best...but we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an aggresive choice with that hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hmm with the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|mareczek: mozna te¿ zrobiæ próbê szlemikow¹, karta W jest tego warta|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: ano, znajac agresje mlodych pierwsze co pomysli W jak zobaczy 1NT czy by tu szlemika nie zagrac :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: if this is drury they play a strange version :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: like a forcing stayman |pg||
nt|bebechira: I wonder if the yougsters parents watching this...they can let us know please|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm with you there Jim|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  east makes it difficult to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d = void @d, 6-9 points and 2 keycards or 15+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: adn 2 nt is usually honor 3 or better  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the relay suit saying "I like clubs" |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to reach 3NT |pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt shud be spade fit and forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: omg, a pushed bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry wasnt what I meant |pg||
mb|3H|nt|timverbeek:  my guess is all pass now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pewnie jeszcze padnie 5 trefli - 5 karo i wreszcie 5 kier|pg||

nt|lechcold: tak jest|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  west to the rescue|pg||
nt|yuval10: S IMO has a lot more than enough to carry on. He can see slam's making against A@s QJ@h Q@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes even less than that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @H lead, may be 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S by E now|pg||
nt|riccho:  really|pg||
nt|sybarra: can that be possible here? |pg||
nt|lechcold: zw³aszcza z minimum si³y|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cicus: hmm, it does not sound like a strong NT now, does it?|pg||
nt|cicus: might even show minors?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@c - 5@h |pg||
nt|mareczek: brak cue bidu pik|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: choæ ju¿ 5 karo jest bez sensu|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@d powinno obiecywac zatrzymanie w pominietym przez partnera kolorze|pg||
nt|riccho:  same weird lead as at the other table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying for the club ruff is my guess |pg||
nt|riccho:  compare the 3@s here with what W had done in bd 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand a far better (imo)|pg||
nt|riccho:  is this really the difference between red and white?|pg||
nt|bebechira: not so easy serhat...hey have 21 VPS buffer|pg||
nt|bebechira: thats a lot of VPs lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||
nt|vbman: when l was a junior ,,, l noted that it was the slams that made us lose matches or win them|pg||
nt|redds: trudny pierwszy wist|pg||
nt|antoniz: po ka¿dym -1 lub -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like going for slam|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hi panos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi |pg||

nt|redds: zobaczymy na co zdecyduje sie popularny Idol|pg||
nt|sybarra: from a spec,  a beek is a small river;  westerbeek means river in the west|pg||
nt|raghavan: North has done well to land in S contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: just has to make it now|pg||
nt|tlc: quite a bid by West..but hard to argue with success...he REALLY liked those two tens!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south pushes a bit to be sure of at least reaching the right game|pg||
nt|athene: if he had just invited he would never be able to show the shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough lesson for N here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: another non-making 50% game|pg||
nt|vbman: good lead indeed|pg||
nt|gregpog: :)|pg||
nt|panosk: since E is a passed hand no much chance for misunderstanding but if he wasnt shows a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||

nt|le joker: @d looks better|pg||
nt|jkotor: potem trefl do 10@c i gwarantowane 3 treflowe|pg||

nt|bebechira: at least... but still not enough i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: LEAD! @H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|timverbeek:  extremely normal 1@S by north|pg||

nt|cicus: maybe with some qualms but E bid the obvious game|pg||

nt|figo: 1NT = 4 spades , 7-8 I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||

nt|sybarra: this hand will not be easy |pg||
nt|bebechira: and more imps for Lotte now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bravo zazzà|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  think you might be right |pg||
