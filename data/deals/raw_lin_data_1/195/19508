pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver|pg||
nt|april7: actually , after @D and @D ruff W should give up a @H as long he has ace of @S and making m5|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both west supported on a good doubleton. Key bid to reach the heart game|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H*|pg||
nt|sverjohn: sry, easts :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Oliver|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N a bit too optomistic of N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: ew are warned now -can they make rigth decision now+|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  but can't blame him since S simply asked for a @h stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h a very marginal overbid, but you have four trumps |pg||
nt|april7: if N switches to @S, contract is down, but very difficult|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 9 of diamonds discourage. Suggests a shift|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: W has then to cash Aand K of @H and play on @C,then also 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done champ!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hei SG|pg||
nt|sveing: Hi Roland:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you shut out 2@s and 3@c from NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now, if North doesn't switch to a spade, this can make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: Yes. West might have struggled in 2@H, but little chance for Declarer now|pg||
nt|sveing: Tre knekter og ettS are leaders after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sverjohn: More roads to one down here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Smat move by Marstrander, but declarer did not fall for it, and should not|pg||

nt|penseur9: thanks Hilde|pg||
nt|runnerup: can be better than 3nt with @d out ,but still down because bad sits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Smart even|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 8 tricks, I fear|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CK could have been onside|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would still give West 12 hcp for his opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to find 3 pitches|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: South played @c7 then @c9 - if normal-style caridng, that should indicate someting in spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: Might be case for playing @S Q, since South opened and N have @C A|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: this is the last segment today. back tomorrow 10 AM local time|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume 2 NT shows 3@H & max|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: club switch best but not enough|pg||
nt|sveing: easy 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: good position for NS, losing only at most 2 @S 1 @H and 1 @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sveing: not enough but if she use the Q?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: does not matter|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - 3@S & max|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sveing: yor are right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  E didn't make things easier by making some silly bid showing the minors so N basically has to rely on his instincts and table feel on the @s suit.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: She has a pitch on @DK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: ligth takeout double and they found a game -now only to make /+1 -even perhaps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andersk: Even with @D K lead, u have nothin to discard @C on, so better find out where @C A is by playing @C|pg||
nt|loe48: east have showed kq in club..so maybe put some values west also|pg||
nt|loe48: but still a pure guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, if he  decides W has the J@s, will have to finesse it immediately as entries to dummy are sparse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  my bet is that he will play E for J@s|pg||
nt|sveing: yepp|pg||
nt|sverjohn: To beat the contract, take your tricks and lock him in dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|sverjohn: Yes!|pg||

nt|vugraphztc: they are writing on the bridgemate, not thinking|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Liv Marit, good morning to you|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Liv|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: hi all :)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Modern neg. double style. Denies 4 spades. Not suitable for 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bjørn Olav Ekren is the man behind the 2@D weak with both majors convention|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting Michaels (presumably) on five to the nine. Still, West has nice spades  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes without saying that he does not play it himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I used to, in one of my partnerships - but we gave it up |pg||
nt|vugraphztc: S is Ekrens brother|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oops, this is Steinar Ekren I now see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Liv Marit :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like need to find @SQ in 4@S unless pitch @D on 13th @C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|johnp: Hi all, ready now|pg||
nt|oliverc: a fairly routine 4@S for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 25 -ok anyway -easy gane|pg||
nt|sverjohn: When in doubt, bid 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: a slam coming up but good save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Could very well reach the normally nice grand now|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14|nt|mdgraham: the reason we gave it up is that in a competitive auction it was not easy sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England most would respond as East - 1NT most likely|pg||
nt|april7: could be pushed to 7!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: hi John|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is eith 26 Hcp -so top for defenders for sure|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|oliverc: everything well placed. Just 2 @S and a Heart to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N might be even more routine. @s suit so poor for NS that possible to lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Ruter/2011/festival/f2011monradlag.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: They violated Hamman's rule...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: This can go astray now. Rekstad may have shown a better hand|pg||
nt|april7: another swing here if it makes or going down, one way or other|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Not enough tricks for NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, the suit behaves so 4@s is safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure what he intended - only 13 HCP|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Both sides overbidding here. Do not like Berset's 3 diamonds. What are his extras?|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnp: Please adwise link for result and cam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps North might have tried 5@D en route - then South can take a swing at 5@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: He may have made it too difficult for himself - many would simply bid 3 NT over 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 1@d probably denies 5c majors|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: always only 12 tricks!!but tempting to bid 7NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sverjohn: Lunna showed the Ace of hearts, but Andersbakk could only find 12 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: South had to do that to keep an entry to dummy - wanted East to have single 10 or J |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  3N has the plus of testing both @hs and @ds for the 9th trick|pg||
nt|sverjohn: good lead. Declarer can prevail by leading small heart twice|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|loe48: correct play is small play from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S is wash&go|pg||
nt|sverjohn: from dummy|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sverjohn: Hansen knew from the bidding that his pd had at least 7 hearts|pg||

nt|andyv:  probably 3N by NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: By North even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably on a D lead|pg||
nt|loe48: both ways should lead to 3nt as i assume 3c show some values|pg||
nt|oliverc: So Declarer got the Spades wrong on  9|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell whether lack of entries or E having only 1@h influenced N in the @s suit.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Sorry, I have visitors and have to go. Thanks everyone. Enjoy the rest of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: he played spade to the queen and then the 9 to W jack|pg||

nt|sharkey: Wonder why he played for the drop....|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@S going down on a @H lead, so NS should stay out ofcourse, let see if possible|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: well, if you don't double something that makes from time to time you aren't doubling enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: has to find @s fit somehow here -to bid 6|pg||
nt|johnp: @s slam but how to get there?|pg||
nt|penseur9: or more :)|pg||
nt|loe48: if they use lebensohl|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what will South do here - pass most likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 2NT to be forcing, or better play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and needs to guess @DQ, with not a lot to go on|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 5h is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 3@D is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would probably go down on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: And good decision by Berset|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  that probably was the most convenient play because of the entry to dummy and give N one more chance (stiff J@s), then playing immediately to hook W.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because both contracts depend on @DQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that they can't beat 3NT, unfair|pg||

nt|mdgraham: nobody said life was fair |pg||
nt|april7: with a signletzon @H and a 5th @C slam would be on and S might have tried by bidding 5@S asking for second round control in @H, but iS is not strong anough|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: in the Discworld novels million-to-one chances come up nine times out of ten |pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - these are 7 board matches so one hand can decide the entire match. Big lead to Abax now|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 3min break|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H opening by N and then....???let see what E does|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|johnp: Another national champ (N)...|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Well done by E-W in the open. Karlsen knows his pd. could be very aggressive in these situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS might get to a pushy 3N|pg||
nt|sverjohn: May have given a few back on the last hand. Impossible to picture pd with a single heart I think|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|veistikke:  isnt multi showing 6@s 6@h or a strong hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: top 8 ATM can win, I beleve 9th and further will be too far behind|pg||
nt|sveing: 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a good idea|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sverjohn: Further actions from N-S could be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2@D equal length in the majors|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|sveing: but i think he will bid that|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|Walddk2: Karlsen knows to switch to a diamond when in with @HJ|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW did their job|pg||
nt|loe48: 1/4|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: 5h ask spade q|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|loe48: 3nt is a fair try ..and shall be tried vul|pg||
