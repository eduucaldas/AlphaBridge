nt|peachy: Lively looking hand to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here in the States, it would often start (w/NS silent) 2NT-3@H*-3@S-? (either 3NT or 4@C).  Some will stop in 3NT; some might push on to a @C or even NT slam - doesn't look so ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx :) |pg||
nt|panosk: hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This must be a very light 3rd seat 1@D by S?|pg||
nt|jcwla: If this auction is to make any sense?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or do we just have it all wrong?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: Routine 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|panosk: double is support i guess meaning 3hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with all bidding, a good stop, looks like just a make|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4333 in E not very appealing |pg||
nt|panosk: redouble probably honor in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes bet so panos|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi kibitzers and operator :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: hi Raija welcome|pg||

nt|kemperg: but 1 off|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Germ...how was breakfast?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fine ty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: re hi, slight connection error apparently|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N a passed hand so likely a pass by S and it is.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|blewah: I'm not sure. i'm not good with names|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ian welcome|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ianmcc: hi Gary|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panosk: 2 Aces missing so 5 is enough|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|peachy: Majority of Chinese players play Precision or similar strong club system|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  I wonder if NS have a way to treat 5-5 in majors when they open 1N|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: down as you'd expect|pg||

nt|andyv:  for many years, 2/1 players played 3@h as 5-5 invite and 3@s as 5-5 GF.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: friendly lie for 3N NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: intersting that 3N failed less than 3@C there|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Ian|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: We have different definitions of "just barely there."|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  E may just bid game here|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D seem plausible here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  and S will have hard time ignoring the 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kemperg: wise to do so|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes...500-800 certainly possible in 5@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was -3 in the CR so still gains 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: hi all!|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Denni|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi pano!|pg||
nt|loe48: Hi Dennis welcome :)|pg||
nt|panosk: even 7 @D is makeable as card lie but i doubt they will get there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: Peaceful looking contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Kibitzer  helped with some information:  this ew play 2/1, west is a famous bridge sponsor, CEO of a quoted company|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: last set was 44-39 heaps of imps traded|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcwla: K&R has that last S hand at a generous 8.6: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ83+Q2+873+Q973 |pg||
nt|panosk: now secured , the friendly lie that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will likely duck on sp  |pg||
nt|sybarra: *duck one |pg||
mb|4N|nt|peachy: I am not surprosed, it looked like a 7 count at first glance|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT seems like the field resting spot here.|pg||
nt|peachy: *surprised|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aria|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|kiwibridge: a decent save non-vul here as 4@H easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: redouble showing 1st round control in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: at these colours asking for too much. pass the right decision.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice auction|pg||
nt|kerasidis: very usufull....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately game not reached CR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd lead to try to defeat, spade is no use since auction revealed singleton opposite A|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|panosk: even possible void (3@S)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blewah: from the 3@h response to 2@s I think NS play 2/1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  nothing left but the @h gess and N may even lead that|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|panosk: E showed 3 spades i think with mud|pg||
nt|blewah: S treats his hand minimum|pg||
nt|blewah: so 15-17NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi aria|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: elimination play needed, which would be good play to avoid @S guess.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and rashed:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Andy.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ian and I are here also Andy, quite a party|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|ianmcc: dead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Played the hand in a hurry and -1.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  hi Ian|pg||
nt|panosk: ruff a @C or @H finess?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Grosvenor @S play there by S.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panosk: well not mud but low |pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|dQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kerasidis: both|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|d6|mc|13|nt|kiwibridge: too hard -1|pg||
nt|panosk: cant really make and cant avoid being in 3nt , i think a push|pg||
nt|sybarra: good point |pg||
nt|panosk: has to decide but after N showing no more @D ruff was safe|pg||
nt|kerasidis: in B 1 closed room is trying 6 @s|pg||
nt|panosk: yes i saw that too lets seewhat happens|pg||
pg||
