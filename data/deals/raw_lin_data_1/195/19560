nt|roswolf: feisty auction so far|pg||
nt|josj: so np Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: should x here I feel - the entire South bid has been singlehanded without any help from his ptr|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: you have to practice dutch before you come to veldhoven :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|dslee: for those who are unawere, NS is a father - son combination|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: maybe, they will understand some English down there as well...|pg||
nt|roswolf: but being charming hosts you all speak english:)|pg||
nt|dslee: with South Hand, I would had preferred to pass - the @H A is a bad card expecially when North bid 3@S only|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: true :)|pg||

nt|athene: but it wasn't likely|pg||
nt|athene: north would probably lead a small singleton club at trick 1|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the bidding in CR - no game and a fight on the 6-level :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|athene: a lot of dubious calls in the other room|pg||

nt|roswolf: maybe some action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: expect South to open 1@D|pg||
nt|dslee: game for NS - choices of 3NT, 4@H - would prefer the latter|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wlc back Mohit|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: didn't he loose 2@D 1@S 1@C ?|pg||
mb|2D|an|MEJORS|nt|dslee: west should be counting and re-counting now - what to bid !|pg||
nt|dslee: ideally I would still overcall 2@C and wait to see where it goes|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and CK|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mohitz:  hi Roland, PS|pg||

nt|dimi: Hello Krishna|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Dimi|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is down 1|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dslee: now 2@D by W is natural|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Mohitz|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c too on @s ruff|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|dslee: lucky this would make , but an outright chance taken|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe more with no entry to hand|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well, Kusharida will be happy to x this|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: i would have passed 2nt as east did in the other room|pg||
nt|josj: I think he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: S should respect the x even with defensive cards, with a balanced hand|pg||
nt|dimi: Dutt should not think about anything else than a pass with his balanced low count|pg||
nt|psyck: *with no def cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver Clarke|pg||

nt|oliverc: ooops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: trump lead?|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunate choice by Souren Dutta, this will likely increase the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvz: now r.a. is thinking|pg||
nt|oliverc: well it could make on a non @S lead...|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzvz: MOUSE PROB|pg||

nt|psyck: no entry to hand oliver :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: on a trump lead migth make :)|pg||
nt|dslee: trying to knock out the only dummy entry - W had to run after @C with @D intact, @S was not the best move since he has a singleton and cant play it once more|pg||
nt|mohitz:  hi debgiri|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi Mohit |pg||
nt|dslee: Good Afternoon and welcome to this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: what about @HA and @SQ now?|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|psridhar: Kushari had plenty of info for that shift|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psridhar: he knew about 6-4 shape in W|pg||
nt|psyck: only good thing about all this shenanigans is that this will make the match tighter|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: this will shorten declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: should be 3 down |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: He knew abt AQ of @c with declarer|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer's @s therefore must be a broken suit as with KQJto 6 @s and AQ of @c he wont wjo|pg||
nt|psridhar: so no hurry for the @c ruff|pg||
nt|mohitz:  true|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Ace of spade is kinda marked with North, so this will be -1|pg||
nt|psridhar: still one needs to draw these inferences and act properly at the tbl|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer is wondering if he can help d2 if kushari has @s 10-i dont think he can|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||

nt|josj: don't think so as score might be wrong|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S for NS - 2NT and probably go from there |pg||
nt|mohitz:  NS play a relay based strong club system|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW play 2/1|pg||
nt|psridhar: did he go d3 ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: d2 only i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: on  17 only 140, we assume|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D promises only 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: i have a lot of sympathy with 3nt here|pg||
nt|dslee: not sure what NS plays , looks like precision or some form of strong @C|pg||
nt|dslee: Mostly a partials hand - unless NS is too ambitious to reach a @H game which can be taken down in a good EW def|pg||
nt|psridhar: admittedly kushari might have held @d jack and @s ace wd give only 15 to South|pg||
nt|psridhar: 14 sry|pg||
nt|psyck: strong @c|pg||
mb|d|nt|dslee: No, sorry, think 4@H would always make|pg||
nt|dimi: NS can make a few tricks in a NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: x is 5-7|pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT shows an obvious @C join|pg||
nt|dslee: x from south - 2@C by Animesh and so on i guess from here?|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry 2@S by animesh- apologies for typo|pg||
nt|mohitz:  Jack of club was known, PS|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally 1N is passed with balanced 8 hcp -but 2Aces is different|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS might do well to stay out of this, though.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: which they will bid now :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mohitz:  choice of minors from Animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: this cannot be a choice of minors :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess if responder has 4M, he could try |pg||
nt|psridhar: true yes he didnt open 1N so king of @s was an error costing 2 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: i guess x was some single suiter, N would have done well to pass|pg||
nt|oliverc: Pass should be automatic by East, I feel|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: until told "officially" we have to accept what we are told|pg||
nt|dslee: i was been told by a kib that NS plays toad @C, not sure of this system|pg||
nt|dslee: he does not have support in @C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  well, he has a doubleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW now in a world of hurt. East couldn't care less if South has Diamonds as West|pg||
nt|oliverc: still able to protect|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mohitz:  partner showed 6 odd clubs |pg||
nt|dslee: unless there is a specific understanding that the @C suit would be a quality one|pg||
nt|mohitz:  (presumably)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh well|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: my 3@C would be all my points in @C with a one hole suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv invited there -not passed 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: hmm...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  looks like a misunderstanding on the meaning of 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mohit|pg||
nt|dslee: crack from banerjee asking for @C lead|pg||
nt|psyck: this is fine for EW, other room may start with 1@h-1@h & go on...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dslee: Hi mohit|pg||
nt|mohitz:  maybe Ani thought it was a fit jump|pg||

nt|mohitz:  well, it did work|pg||

nt|dslee: undo?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to Srini, who is familiar with the N-S methods|pg||
nt|oliverc: but if he'd passed over 1@D, South would doubtless have bid Hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mohitz:  hi Srini|pg||
pc|d7|nt|strike12: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|dslee: hi srini- can you explaing the toad @c system?|pg||
nt|dslee: I am sure Manas would have a word or two with amarnath after this hand :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: playing cricket one becomes accustomed to it:):(|pg||
nt|bobholl: if P has only 4@C @D necessary so seen good :)|pg||
nt|josj: they have replays nowadays :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mohitz:  rehi|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but not easy for E to keep quiet at 1 level even if pd showed zilch|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: But as I said before, If South had Diamonds (and would pass North's 1@D bid)|pg||
nt|oliverc: West still has a bid if he has something|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: to overrule the umpires' clear views|pg||
nt|mohitz:  in 5@DXX, Animesh might have finessed diamond queen|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for -2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: still only 8 tricks on @s hook failing|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mohitz:  this wll be a quick claim|pg||
nt|strike12: it is basically a relay based strong club system, |pg||
nt|dslee: but how they dint reach this game or pass in 2@C with a @C lead?|pg||
nt|dslee: i mean 2@C x?|pg||
nt|strike12: X by N showed 5-7 so S shd bid game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: unless India are involved:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: TV cameras in cricket nowadays ?|pg||
nt|psyck: E was likely expecting S to bid 1@s on 1@d on which he would be stuck if does not bid immed|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i guess North showed his hand yes|pg||
nt|strike12: 2c X is 19+|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|josj: communications for declarer are very bad on this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least cricket is played by a lot of dutchmen although their orange strip is not too traditional from the english point of view|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mohitz:  laltu bid 5@H too in bd 15|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|s6|pg||

nt|dslee: i dont know his father but I know animesh|pg||
nt|dslee: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|strike12: yes should be flat board|pg||
nt|dslee: for all the kibbers, Mohit is one of the very promising indian youngstars from Bangalore|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H or 2@S from EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: OR may climb to 2N and if he misguesses @d queen , can be down a bunch|pg||
nt|mohitz:  i dont think you can stop in 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: or in 4@d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  if inviting, North will accept surely|pg||
nt|mohitz:  1@D might be opened too|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dslee: last hand , would had preferred a 2@S from Manas probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@H all pass probably|pg||
nt|mohitz:  colors not right for North to enter the auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: if a purist 1@d opening then it can get to 2N |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mohitz:  3@C is just down 1 though|pg||
nt|psyck: ...after starting with 1@c prec last deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H looks straightforward|pg||
nt|mohitz:  tx Deb|pg||
nt|dslee: u wlc M|pg||
nt|strike12: X by S is @d|pg||
nt|dslee: cant contest I guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1@d-1n-2n all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: 2c is trs|pg||
nt|mohitz:  So, EW play precision too |pg||
mb|p|nt|strike12: with min 5 @d|pg||
nt|mohitz:  EW can make upto 3@H on correct guesses|pg||
nt|psridhar: precn will get to game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: interesting choice of 1N here|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N is generally played as 15-18, but with that solid @h, had other options|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mohitz:  if opening 1@D, East will probably overcall |pg||
nt|psyck: i thought either 1N or 1@c would get to game, surprisingly both didn't :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  and that might affect the bidding|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: but +1 ??|pg||
nt|dslee: hmm, i seen this lot of people playing 1@C-2@C as @D transfer - now it has got rare|pg||
nt|mohitz:  3N is fine too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not sure why East didnt bid 2@S|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, Animesh isn't the one to go down peacefully! |pg||
nt|mohitz:  anyway, another 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar: tightens the match good|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|mohitz:  PS, what defense do you play after this auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mohitz:  1@C prec followed by 1N rebid that is|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dslee: why not a simple 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|strike12: i like 2nt with @d stuff|pg||
nt|dslee: i would hate to hide my master suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: same as 1N opg|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mohitz:  defenders have to establish a heart trick|pg||
nt|mohitz:  that seems convenient but i am convinced its right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mohitz:  11 tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  because presumably with both majors etc, we would have entered over 1@D itself?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *not|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the context of no bidding in the earlier round|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mohitz:  no, but say you play 1@C - p - 1@D - X as both majors|pg||
nt|psridhar: pass and bid in immd position -south here- i play as strong ; in North it is balancing|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dslee: no quesitons asked :)|pg||
nt|dslee: best thing to do is play @D|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay|pg||
nt|mohitz:  2@D looks like -1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dslee: after cashing the @C|pg||
nt|mohitz:  yea, make now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S @C squeeze possible if @S ruffed and no @C back ty kibs :)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mohitz:  heart shift best|pg||
nt|mohitz:  will declarer lose control?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 8 or 9 tricks in @h for EW; if kushari makes this the match may become a tie /close to it|pg||

nt|strike12: looks like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not so much fun when we dont have the convention cards |pg||
nt|dslee: 1NT?|pg||
nt|mohitz:  oh dear, East has revoked while defending 5@H |pg||
nt|mohitz:  in the other room|pg||
nt|psyck: precision style, short @d's|pg||
nt|dimi: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: can south pass on this?|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would a clear maximum even :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: or double - tough choice imo|pg||
nt|psyck: played by E, an o/t in 5@c on @hK lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|strike12: this will be costly|pg||
nt|dslee: 2NT here shows min @H support 3@C is pass or correct to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  i like 2@S by West here opposite a passed hand, gives them more trouble :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bobholl: another possiblity :)|pg||
nt|strike12: good X by N|pg||
nt|dslee: obvious one |pg||
nt|mohitz:  so, the lead extends for railways|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: when do they open 1@D? this was a @D opening ideally playing the strong @C system - 1NT open would had been a little ambitious though|pg||
nt|mohitz:  for example, here is West bids 2@S, North must bid 2N which might be a level high|pg||
nt|mohitz:  *if|pg||
nt|psyck: W's @dK could well be a major K, so E will explore|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzvz: MOUSE PROBLEM SRY|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if n/s play precision 1@D MIGHT BE 0+|pg||
nt|josj: 1@H we had not thought of but it solves the problem to perfection|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dslee: -1 or -2 depending on def and play - this x by N is penalty? I guess no|pg||
nt|psridhar: north has played this game b4 and pass 2@s like he did in Bd no 30|pg||
nt|mohitz:  :)|pg||
nt|mohitz:  okay, but that might be wrong on days|pg||
nt|psridhar: on more days your 2@S will be taken to the cleaners|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@c setting suit & gf in this seq|pg||
mb|4H|nt|josj: they do|pg||
nt|mohitz:  East wont like the dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: @d short already known, so the cue should be an honor|pg||
nt|psyck: which is not particularly good news for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: YES THE PLAYERS AT THE TABLE OFTEN HAVE THE BEST POINT OF VIEW|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry keyboarditis again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1@D passed out scores best :)|pg||
nt|dslee: yah, often we dont like our dummies - seldom we do :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mohitz:  he wanted to get his spade suit in|pg||
nt|mohitz:  also preempts 1@H overcalls|pg||
nt|mohitz:  not a bad strategy in 3rd seat |pg||
nt|mohitz:  i actually don't think there is a lot of risk of being taken to the cleaners if partner knows our style|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner may have no role to play |pg||
nt|mohitz:  true i agree sometimes it might go pass pass X etc|pg||
nt|psyck: no more poorly than the 3N in other room|pg||
nt|mohitz:  but in my (limited) experience it works out quite well|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mohitz:  how did you figure -1?|pg||
nt|strike12: @d shift now|pg||
nt|dslee: lets see - if its a penalty, E has a lot of clues now|pg||
nt|dslee: I bet the move will be @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: so another push|pg||
nt|psyck: that was poorly judged|pg||
nt|psyck: with no major cue, maybe W should not bid 4N, in any case E needs too much from pd for slam after 4@d bid|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes. If West not encouraged by the @H cue and can't show the Spade king, East|pg||
nt|oliverc: should subside in 5@C|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@c played by E after the lead of @h K would be on ... all other leads and position is down one|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h was rkc i'm told|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, no chance played by West|pg||
nt|psyck: but looking at 4N response, maybe they were not on the same page|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|bobholl: now not a push jos :)|pg||
nt|josj: i c   :(|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: but I can't believe it|pg||
nt|psridhar: why did he overtake? declarer cant hv 5 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck: nv, decent suit, some shape, i've no gr8 objection to 2@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: having overtaken he might well hv shifted to @s|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently 4nt was explained by Samant to Souren as 2 key cards + trump Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dslee: lol|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: we really don't want to know what their bidding meant anyway :)|pg||

nt|dslee: yes, both the sides plays strong @C|pg||

nt|mohitz:  can make 4@S |pg||

nt|dslee: Raj 1 has to pull up in next 10, this I guess is gone for them|pg||
nt|drkvas:  u can play 14 15 if u like|pg||
nt|mohitz:  putting up all nt ranges in 1@C hurts during competition|pg||
nt|dslee: no 1NT here from E?|pg||
nt|dslee: N for his pass is assumed to hold a @H length and @S short|pg||
nt|psridhar: there are other objectives to bidding than just give your lho a problem|pg||
mb|2D|nt|josj: 3nt by N is best but difficult to reach now ...|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n frivilous interference hurts too|pg||
nt|strike12: 1@h is specifically 4 @s so E might wait and watch here|pg||
nt|dslee: since 1@S is opened , they can take off to 4 now|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: maybe N is considering a slam|pg||

nt|josj: remote...|pg||
nt|mohitz:  the other table, east opened 1N all pass|pg||

nt|mohitz:  in NT, defenders can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|mohitz:  on a heart lead|pg||
nt|dslee: not the most obvious lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|drkvas:  i think rajasthans team is an adhoc 1|pg||
nt|mohitz:  opposite a PH, that has to be one of the primary objectives imo|pg||
nt|psridhar: anyway i dont endorse 2@s and not interested in discussing its merits /demerits|pg||
mb|p|nt|mohitz:  South might bid 4@S now|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|bobholl: kind of slamtry may be :)|pg||

nt|athene: it's all very well saying "never jeopardize your contract" but if it's a 95% chance at another 3 imps, vs a 5% chance of going down in a NV game - the maths says you should take ...|pg||
nt|athene: the chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: a spec points out that declarer could try to get the best of both worlds|pg||

mb|2N|nt|athene: cashing nine tricks then finessing clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|mohitz:  pass, 2@D and or even 2@H makes sense to me|pg||
nt|dslee: desperate - choose your best 3 card|pg||
nt|dslee: thats what 2@D would had been|pg||
nt|dslee: some agreements play as 5 4 4 and @D can be passed|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: well EW don't have a problem with ten counts|pg||

nt|athene: west opened 1@H on a far worse hand than east's here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think 1@D on this hand is normal enough (the 1@H earlier was more pushy, most would pass)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: north might be thinking of 2@H now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok he did :) - :(:(:( for me|pg||
nt|athene: there is no danger partner will get carried away - the only problem is when 2@H itself is very wrong|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|pelu: can W bid 3@d?|pg||
nt|kemperg: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes do but i think it's fairly revolting|pg||
nt|pelu: I would also pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|athene: in the other room, if south could have doubled 2@D as a general competitive noise, that might have helped|pg||

mb|1N!|an|TRF to !C|nt|athene: meaning you double with a hand like that and then if partner bids clubs you pull to diamonds, not showing a massive hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: passing the X seems attractive -after the t.o X on his right, there is no guarantee that 2@S will make|pg||

nt|psyck: similar here too|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk4: or passing even as rv suggests|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: needs a fairly gross misdefence from north to make |pg||
nt|athene: north has to keep the @CA9 and then get himself endplayed to give declarer the @C10|pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of this segment. Thanks to our operator, Andri - Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Jos and Bob for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: last board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: this could be another swing for IR if Manas-Amarnath get to 3n instead of 4@s in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|josj: another slam and once again not such  good one, worse than the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pulling 3NT seems strange. He did bid his spades three times before that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: And he has excellent cards for notrump after that|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: yes @DQ is a gold card and 2 outside kings|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: blank honour works either way provided you guess correctly which way :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might be bid|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all, last segment of 14 boards will start in a little while after this.|pg||
nt|psyck: WB seem to have gone overboard on deal 54 too...looks like all over for them|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: both pards showing shortages - great news|pg||
nt|psyck: Will be Railways-Maharastra A finals tomorrow assuming scores are right.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|josj: I hope they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|bobholl: lunch is ready so have to go tya cu :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjb: for result : http://halamanbridge.org/batam/|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will soon see|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Manas's 3@d here would be NF, hence his decision to temporise with 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to tje|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry|pg||
nt|rv: Banerjee could have rebid his @s suit once more instead of slightly contrived 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HJ to the king, @DQ, king ace, club to dummy, @D9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so 3NT will make in comfort|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, thanks all.|pg||

nt|roswolf: may convert|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|josj: ty Andri and cu |pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Manas's 2n was F1, I actually prefer 2n instead of 3@c even if 3@d was NF|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 6@S =?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: VERY WELL DONE |pg||

pc|dT|pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: so S thought they had a @S fit and thus they ended up in the best contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: luck plays its part|pg||
nt|josj: board still to be played in CR|pg||
