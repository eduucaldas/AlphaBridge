nt|psyck: esp with the @h suit, if it there the @s suit, you may occasionally get a chance to show it after passing 1st time|pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes it is right not to occupy the 5th level - look on the @c10 and on the @d10 in East's hand. They provide extra chances for the 4th defensive trick|pg||
nt|psyck: well, with only 1 sure def trick outside @h, it is taking quite a view to not bid 5@h|pg||
