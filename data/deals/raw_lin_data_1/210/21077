mb|p|nt|jjsb: so this is a match probably for the second seat , still interesting |pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@d denying 3@s |pg||
nt|jjsb: or actually maybe 2@c forced 2@d |pg||
nt|jjsb: and 2nt showed the 11 |pg||
nt|jjsb: here the very good things for declarer is that the J of @s is on South's hand |pg||
nt|jjsb: if not i would think the defense would be in control |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|jjsb: hand an also favorable @s lay out |pg||
nt|jjsb: note the K87 of @s on south |pg||
nt|jjsb: give N the 7 for exemple its not totally same music|pg||
nt|jjsb: so declarer can make 1h 4@d 3@s (thank to the @s situation ) and not in danger in @d |pg||
nt|jjsb: i see it ùaking +1 if nothing "fancy happen"|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pg||

nt|jjsb: this is why i said about K87 ... scary situation for South she is pussled now :) |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|jjsb: she she will play @c and @s back |pg||
nt|jjsb: i dotn see any clear way to maje that other than playing on @s |pg||
nt|jjsb: so maybe plays is useless (u know J in offside) i think she will just find the position |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jjsb: ok let see 1@h 4c 2@s she needs 2d only|pg||
nt|jjsb: so maybe a @d to 10 is possible also |pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|nt|jjsb: for the same result |pg||
