nt|jjsb: 4 teams competing there so its 3 round robin 3 match against all other 3 teams |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: maybe E will open 1nt (11-14)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jjsb: Indonesia are definitely the big favourite od this competition with there awesome performance in the latest Venice cup ! |pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: small @S lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jjsb: so this is a match probably for the second seat , still interesting |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be a transfer response showing diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jjsb: this one is normally going 1 off as i see it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dgame: hi all|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jjsb: so its 1 off , one would think west hand is a 10 ccard fit but offensively looks a bit poor , still attraction of the vulnerable game is too much not to bid game |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jjsb: 1nt P 2@c and now it will be on East to decide what she wants to do |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: even 5 @c for some agressive player (i would not do it) is not out of question |pg||

nt|don_kapu: normal  4@S and easy bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 3@c is probably the choice of many player |pg||

mb|4C|nt|jjsb: and sometimes 5 @d will work better |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am not sure i would pass .... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: i i think 1@s 2@h a @c is the most defense can do |pg||
nt|jjsb: for a very bad result for phil .. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes i know the club fit is longer, so this is hardly an advert for the opening :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: hiks|pg||

nt|jjsb: but a wasting KQ of @h |pg||
nt|jjsb: and scary @s|pg||
nt|jjsb: still she showed so far no value and she does have values |pg||
nt|jjsb: so its not that clear |pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but tobing might pass this|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jjsb: i can easily understand, the 4nt |pg||
