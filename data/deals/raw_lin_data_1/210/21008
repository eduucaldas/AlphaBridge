nt|sybarra: egads,  when opening "any 11 (9, 10) "  13 is a rock crusher |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i cant see why the grand cant be bid|pg||
nt|ewj: oops, wont be bidding grand now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H IS OFF THE WALL IMO|pg||
nt|ewj: not that clear to bid small slam...|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the availability of 13 tricks|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say,  that is not a 4 @H bid to me |pg||
nt|ewj: ah, good stuff, maybe will now|pg||
nt|roswolf: in england we are still bashers we need to learn discipline + science|pg||
nt|ewj: 5NT now? 2 and void?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes science can get in your way also |pg||
nt|ewj: sureeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|roswolf: as far as i can see this is guesswork now|pg||
nt|ewj: hard to diagnose the void|pg||
nt|ewj: well, i mean, which void it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: but if north opens 1@H then science gets them to the grand in the right suit|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm now up to south|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: I just dont think you can find 7 here |pg||
nt|ewj: South probably just pleased to find a small slam, after not a clear move|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry,  science or not |pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not impressed and these 2 guys normally are great bidders|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 5NT shows 2KC + @HQ + void|pg||
nt|sybarra: one spec suggests this auction:  1@H - 2@D - 4@S.. 7@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: some specs suggest a spade barrage would hurt n/s bidding to slam - nonsense it would probably assist them|pg||
nt|sybarra: or this ne by another:  1@H 2@D 3 @S  4@C 4@S 7 @D@h ??:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: barely audible|pg||
nt|sharkey: Catherine has more guts than I...|pg||
nt|ady: 8@D  not a 2nd stopper Carl   but north no entry   though declarer would not be aware|pg||

nt|santyclz: From w's rebids it either was 2@hs or 2@s was a convention with which I am unfamiliar...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Roger.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 top tricks without @hs or @ss.  Perhaps 4@h would have been easier.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Sorry, even that doesn't do it unless there is no entry to the 4th @c...|pg||
nt|santyclz: So, what can we learn from  this hand?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Possibilities.  1:  That's not an opening bid.  2:  That's not enough to force to game with a void in partners suit or 3:  on this type of auction it's ok to bid 3nt with a ...|pg||
nt|santyclz: singleton in pd's suit but not a void (unless you have enough tricks without his suit) or 4:  nothing, it's just an unlucky hand.|pg||
