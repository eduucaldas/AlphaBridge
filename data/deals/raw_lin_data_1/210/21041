nt|darrene:  Any split tie is broken on the head to head match|pg||
mb|1D|an| |mb|p|mb|1S|an| |nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what action by West|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rmb1: I can't find a VP scale but 17-13 must be more than 10IMP margin|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the auction might not go this way at all tables...|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N the spot here though 4H would rarely come to harm|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1D is 0+ could be 4M6m, 2C is GF artificial|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Crouch says 3@s would be a weaker hand that wanted to show @h (instead of 3@H)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H has play too, of course, single dummy. few bidding systems codify announcement or denial of the ten of trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2D rebid by North would show a balanced hand, so 2@S is unbalanced (with @H??)|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S is natural but may (exceptionally) be 3|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|ady: already 2 tricks too high  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: curtis has passed, townsend is thinking...|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays likely to be  minus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and 1D?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: good hand to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 4@d described as @d shortage on the SW side of the screen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wb Geoff:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but no better than 50% - and objectively worse - for slam of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this look slike a good auction to me, and presumably N has done enough|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ady: may take diamond ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: yes no adventures on the first bd of the match|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1D is 0+ can be 6m+4M otherwise denies 6m, |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: will lose A@S  and heart trick  and still to find Q@C|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|ady: seems 1 or 2 down|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6@C looks good here|pg||
mb|1D|an| |mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: and thgis opening may push them to it|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something to be said for acting on E hand in first chair at these colors when opposing a pair with excellent bidding methods|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|roswolf: might well be bid by the strong club system used by n/s|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|roswolf: still might be bid|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5@C shows some expectation of making so I expect North will raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes left to themselves n/s might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as meat loaf would say: "You took the words right out of my mouth"|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly that is my general agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: hmm caution prevails|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a weak2 suiter opening creates a lot of problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  presumeably denies 3 card spade support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Tom held up 2 fingers |pg||
nt|ady: and it appears no re transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks the outcome|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: north has a hand with sharp values and the singleton spade - much easier to bid rather than to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is why opps preempt i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: to make it difficult|pg||
nt|marlowepi: preempting in general is one of the most attractive, if not irresistible tactical weapons. but in reviewing one's results with excruciating objectivity after the fray, one needs to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  acknowledge the many times a preempt drives foes to a lucrative spot they might not otherwise have found|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades win again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if that is not in the toybox, 2S or (mini)multi is availavble and somewhat attractive|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: this is not a critique of the present 4S call, as when opps play forcing club with sophisticated methods you dont want to give them a free run|pg||
nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: even not often you see an unforced r&d on vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: This is a match between Crouch-ing Tiger and Hinden Dragon|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D is a simply a good raise of hearts.  (Thanks to Crouch/Patterson for 60+ pages of system notes)|pg||

mb|2C|an| |mb|3H|an| |mb|3S|nt|roswolf: that 1@H OVERCALL FILLS ME WITH HORROR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus the hysterical screaming:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C may well be a transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: or an artificial gf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would also overcall with W, if i had a different hand:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: trump lead looks best|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: think this will just be made|pg||
nt|ady: cant stop 1 spade ruff   and can then make 2 club tricks with a ruffing finesse with K@D as an entry for the 2nd club trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: 15-17 is the rebid as stated on their card|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1NT = 15-17|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: seemingly effortless|pg||
nt|rmb1: page 44 omits 1D(1H)2C :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be fair, Geoff, what other lead can W tolerate? :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly landed on his feet|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|rmb1: But almost by default, responses over intervention are transfers|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: our joking aside, the reason for the 1H overcall is to get pd off to a H lead if opps play 3N, and hope the 2 entries plus anything of partner's beats it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: reversing the order   but the same result|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is the winning scenario. but of course there are ;losing ones|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: raising to 6 had to have been very appealing, but probably N was swayed by 3 considerations: (1) maybe just +620 is a winning boiard, i.e. the contract is 4SX at the other table   ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (ii) any finesse is likely to be losing       (iii) if preempting drives us to a minus score, that is much better morale candy for the foe than if we stop short of a makeable slam, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which might easily be only a push. it will only encourage them toward more antics|pg||
nt|roswolf: good explanation marshall = still sometimes pard takes you too seriously|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: now just needs to ruff a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: wow more testing hands - this set of hands is testing|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an| |nt|roswolf: softly softly by west|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: not that easy to reach that slam, but the bidding underscores a very important principle: bid your suits on good hands and when pd is an unpassed hand. premature use of a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: quantitative NT bid when holding a  long suit risks missing a slam. |pg||
nt|roswolf: the spotlight is now on east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: your typical randomly-dealt session. slam in the picture on every hand....|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be concerned about the doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: SW still discussing the last hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: likely to be the end of this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|roswolf: onward and upwards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here again we see the double-edged sword of the active preempt  --  S has gobbled up some EW space but E also now knows his pd is short in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes now 5the problem is NOT to bid the grand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i also play my jump raises preemptive, but it does feed the enemy to let them know that at least one opponent has a hand that fears a high making contract by us|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt = pick a slam is possible now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: anyone know the e/w no-trump range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Curtis looks at the EW CC: 2/1 GF, 15-17NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: does RKCB help here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but what was 4N?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double is obvious by S, but it is worth noting that it could work out badly. for example, if EW have certain agreements about freely accepting a transfer after a double, and E has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a bordeline hand, you might push them to a making game because your hand is pure and your kings are probably in the slot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very aggressive by south|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpv: RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: according to Jagger|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|roswolf: fairer comment:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not arguing with certain kinds of success results in future disasters :)|pg||

nt|ady: one north avoided  the heart lead   this looks down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a risk to push opps to 3H, counting on his strongish trumps to avoid a double. and/or opps presumed respect for his dummy play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have had length in a black suit too of course. felt odds in his favor|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|artificial game force|nt|roswolf: short lunch for commentators|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt could easily be the contract here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board of this set, thanks to op (Simon) and to Marshall and Geoffrey, thanks to EBU/BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D is my guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pleasure robin|pg||

nt|roswolf: 5@D may struggle too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5 looks safe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead, trumps, 3 rounds of spades tossing club if no cover|pg||

nt|vugraphzpv: Yes, it has been :) and I'll see you all again in a bit|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well having bid the game they should make it|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D is D, 4@C @CA, etc..|pg||
mb|5C|an|2 with no Q|nt|roswolf: in 6@D WEST may well not lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i doubt they will find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hope you can all see the explanations: 1C strong, 1D weak, 1NT 17-19, 2C=H, 2H=3,|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rmb1: Hinden gain 10IMP on 17,  Forrester/Gold bid 6@C but did not make it.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  K&R (A9 J74 KQ62 AKT8) = 17.55 |pg||
nt|rmb1: If 3NT fails here (which it can) the match will be very close|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpv: No idea who the operators will be tomorrow but it should be someone better than myself :)|pg||

nt|rmb1: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: now cold but declarer needs ome care|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: it will fail i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: 20 boards is also tough for commentators if they also trying to eat lunch and be consulted on rulings from other matches :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE DEFENCE KNOWS DECLARER'S POINT COUNT FAIRLY ACCURATE AND EAST SHOULD DEDUCE WEST MUST HAVE THE HEART ACE FOR DECLARER'S EARLY CLUB PLAY|pg||
