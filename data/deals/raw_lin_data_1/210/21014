mb|p|mb|d|nt|yo_yo: i am told multi also  2-7   so this is a good weak 2 thn|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|darrene:  It helps to know what partner would protect on in these auctions|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mugsmate:  Kendrick just looking for strain|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  Two places|pg||
nt|steshome:  2NT is two places to play is my guess|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Declarer usually has short spades, and since partner hasn't raised you, dummy often has 4. Since we know dummy has two places to play a crossruff is strongly threatened.|pg||

mb|2N|nt|darrene:  indeed when this close small imp gains matter|pg||
nt|roswolf: another tempter but e/w should easily avoid the temptation|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that 2NT opener?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mugsmate:  Well judged by Kendrick to stay low. This is an advantage of the light 4 card major style they employ. Once MEstel hadn't opened, Kendrick had a clue not to push for game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like it but would bid it!|pg||
nt|darrene:  it's practical|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The alternative would be 1D-1X-3NT rebid, which shows something like this in the modern style.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is there not too much chance of missing a slam , not showing the good 6 card minor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think east should sign off he is min and has a lot of soft values|pg||
nt|roswolf: and only 2 trumps|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west is tempted|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: brakes now surely|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is tempted not west|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Mestel 'explains' 4NT as we have NO agreement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kendrick is doing too much , he made one slam try |pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case he should sign off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless he's answering to blackwood?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a disaster waiting to happen|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Kendrick is telling aces. 1 of 5.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4NT sounds like a shut out to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|steshome:  Surely 4NT was a sign off?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  A nice modern method over these transfers is to play completion as guaranteeing a 3 card fit.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:   And a 3NT break as denying one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  Over the completion showing a fit, you now have room to show shortage, or bid 3NT to start a cueing sequence.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6nt can make but wont i fear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a @S  lead would be nice for declarer|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Well, they got to a reasonable spot.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  They just need the spades to come in.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|roswolf: west will land on his feet here|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Well, Mestel thought it was a suit - bid 4NT to say drop dead, and Kendrick thought he was cueing for spades.|pg||
nt|roswolf: east bidding - incroyable|pg||
nt|roswolf: the ground shakes and the axe is being sharpened|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Perhaps they play some method of showing a single suited slam try on the first round that wasn't used, giving Kendrick an insoluable problem.|pg||
nt|steshome:  This sequence is a bit anarchic|pg||
nt|roswolf: or maybe they just werent on the same planet|pg||

nt|steshome:  My agreement with my partners is that after I've used stayman, if they bid a major, then double from either side is penalties, not take-out|pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: well at all vul ac penalty double by east loooks obvious if he has spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mine too sarah|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  A heart lead is required.|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Now a heart switch may be enough.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Should be enough I reckon|pg||
nt|steshome:  And looks the obvious switch|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  But remember, Erichsen can't see the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a spade might also be tempting|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He may play for three spade tricks.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what would partner lead from AK98?  |pg||
nt|mugsmate:  No - needs to rise  K.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: also if they play smith peters  the @D7 looks high|pg||
nt|steshome:  Is the club lead consistent with AK(*x?|pg||
nt|steshome:  I meant AK98x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love smith peters, does everyone else?|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He may also be considering between the A, J or low heart.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: playing high on the next trick means you like the  lead|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The Jack would be required if partner had A9x|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  It would set up a finesse against dummy's h10 after declarer covered the jack.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always fear for a player when he tanks this long|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Yes - K9x, sorry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kendrick has carefully hidden the @D 2 to make south think North has made a smith peter|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Interestingly, the fact that declarer hasn't cashed a top diamond first may suggest to Erichson that his partner has the d10.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Not keen on Smith personally - shouldn't be relevant - you can work the hand out from first principles|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where i would like to know what south is thinking about|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am not so clever unfortunately, i like my partner to tell me if he likes the lead|pg||
