mb|p|mb|2S|an|a|nt|andyv:  optomistic|pg||
nt|josj: even with the @CJ coming down, you still need a finesse|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  may not even get to slam here|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will need to cue and then ask N if they have a @s control|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't see them bidding 7|pg||
nt|josj: definitely not, they will be happy after finding themselves in 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h here would ask for @s control but S doesn't yet know about the A@c|pg||
nt|josj: it also depends on 3NT being min. or max.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S can assume that N has the K or A of @s since he is looking at the Q|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|josj: now they have a chance to get anywhere near|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by N would show @s and @c control for some|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|josj: hmmm...|pg||
nt|andyv:  ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think you are right, Jos...it does depend on what a jump to 3N means for NS|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now, not sure what 5@h means but N should bid 6...has both 1|pg||
nt|josj: good bid, 5@C would convey mainly the same message|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s control and good @hs|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|josj: 6@C now|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would invite 7 but why would S want to do that?|pg||
nt|josj: why not?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hole in @d suit and the Q@c is not well placed|pg||
nt|josj: as Garozzo used to say: "Before you start bidding any board. don't forget this: It might be slam..."|pg||
nt|andyv:  he will be satisfied in 6@hs (until they compare scores)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but he also played them 3 tricks better than most morals|pg||
nt|andyv:  mortals|pg||
nt|josj: he certainly used to, yes|pg||
nt|josj: still alive and kicking at 84|pg||
nt|josj: so Thailand double their score here|pg||
