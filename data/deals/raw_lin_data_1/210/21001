nt|ewj: I always tend to rebid my 3 card suit in this situation, and if I get a correction to 2@S, bid 3@S|pg||
nt|baldjean: Defense needs to run @d early enough here, but early enough means they have some time.|pg||
nt|ewj: Of course, maybe Espen was reluctant to rebid his 3 card suit, as it was a major and more likely to be raised|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|baldjean: I like to show trump controls with NT bids when cue bidding. Of course you need an agreement with partner for that.|pg||
