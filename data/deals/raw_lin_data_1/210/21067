nt|jjsb: East made some noise and west have really some awesome card as i can see all key card , and the Ace of @h looking so good so probably be tempted with that auction |pg||
nt|jjsb: sorry again i missed that one , but i have my coffee now at least !! (i can share)|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: E sound clear at lead 5@H + 4@D|pg||

nt|jjsb: just that here ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @h 5-1|pg||
nt|jjsb: it will cause a big problem... |pg||
nt|don_kapu: exellent bid and now exellent play or no|pg||
nt|jjsb: i have been said 4@d was RKC |pg||
nt|don_kapu: it may not be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: some suggest if u took west as the hand u play it u will make 2 ruff and can make it |pg||
nt|jjsb: the problem is if u play it from other side (east) u win when @h are 4-2 so... |pg||
nt|jjsb: i also see some suggest a @h lead |pg||
nt|jjsb: well i dont know.. yes i can see that u can get a @h ruff for down 1 |pg||
nt|don_kapu: if N lead @H all the problem will clear and W will go home|pg||
nt|jjsb: but so often u will just help declarer |pg||
nt|jjsb: as u know he will count on that suit to make |pg||
nt|jjsb: i mean u have a J of @s that comes quite well ?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i suggest N will lead @S J|pg||
nt|jjsb: im with u |pg||
nt|jjsb: i think the only good thinks about the @h lead is if partner got the Ace . is it likely? i dont know..|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|don_kapu: maybe E will open 1nt (11-14)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|jjsb: so its 1 off , one would think west hand is a 10 ccard fit but offensively looks a bit poor , still attraction of the vulnerable game is too much not to bid game |pg||

pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jjsb: she she will play @c and @s back |pg||
nt|jjsb: i dotn see any clear way to maje that other than playing on @s |pg||
nt|jjsb: so maybe plays is useless (u know J in offside) i think she will just find the position |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|nt|jjsb: ok let see 1@h 4c 2@s she needs 2d only|pg||
