nt|jjsb: 4 teams competing there so its 3 round robin 3 match against all other 3 teams |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|don_kapu: maybe E will open 1nt (11-14)|pg||
mb|d|nt|jjsb: Indonesia are definitely the big favourite od this competition with there awesome performance in the latest Venice cup ! |pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: small @S lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jjsb: so this is a match probably for the second seat , still interesting |pg||
