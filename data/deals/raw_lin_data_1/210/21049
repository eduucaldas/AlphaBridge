nt|jjsb: 4 teams competing there so its 3 round robin 3 match against all other 3 teams |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jjsb: Indonesia are definitely the big favourite od this competition with there awesome performance in the latest Venice cup ! |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jjsb: so this is a match probably for the second seat , still interesting |pg||
nt|fabsayc: must be a transfer response showing diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jjsb: this one is normally going 1 off as i see it |pg||
