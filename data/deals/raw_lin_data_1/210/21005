nt|henryb:  Hallo Henri|pg||

nt|ritong: nice morning for your boys|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: so a few imps for some overtricks on Board 1|pg||
nt|mug: sorry it's 1.5 IMPs, so England win the ties|pg||
nt|ritong: boyd has a clearcut 2@c overcall  robinson's reaction is interesting to observe|pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugraphznx: Hi Kath|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a toy|pg||
nt|grebrof: look like a flat board again, but you never know|pg||
nt|henryb:  and driving to the three level seems like a lot|pg||
nt|subhranp: not sure of the range of 1n for EW, normally 1n should be opened by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: "Toys R us"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: director called|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 1@h not alerted |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W alerted it is txf|pg||
mb|d|nt|subhranp: this is a good spot for DSM|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c showed @s & @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
nt|grebrof: mostly for kids, but someone never grow up - guilty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: when playing @hQ Leenhardt played cQ instead of @hj|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
nt|farfie: un solide 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
nt|farfie: 11 levées sur la place du roi de @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: boyd estimates that his shape is more adapted to a suit contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
nt|grebrof: Q of h!?|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he might even finesse @d 9, for the fun|pg||
pc|s4|nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
nt|grebrof: whe n your P opens and you have a 6  card mjor suit, I find no defense not bidding them at the 3 level  - esprcialy holding the A|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 off|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems to be down 2 |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
nt|ritong: really|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|mamos: Club lead will allow trump promotion|pg||
nt|szalay: more likely 3|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h needs a very accurate defense to go down|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe + 1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|alnanda: lead @s big problem for declerer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know i would go down, let's see if Nicola Smith can make it|pg||
nt|alnanda: ohh sorry|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe they use it as GF, but thats to timid I think|pg||
nt|ritong: kindof wild, isn t it?|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mamos: although  .......|pg||
nt|mug: passed out in the OR, didn't West have 14 points?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mug: you're supposed to ask "how did the bidding go?", victor|pg||

mb|d|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||

nt|runnerup: slam|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|runnerup: i see -slam not so clear -but makes this time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 5-5, the @s trick is not running away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahalim: the indonesian players were once coaached by Kokish, that's why they play weak NT|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h blocked''|pg||
nt|ahalim: this has no change at all|pg||
nt|mamos: West hast to overtake and play @sQ to defeat I think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|alnanda: with no information, i think same result with other table, can't find Q@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: additionally many Ws will put in @cK if you lead it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  but the ruff is ...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|rmb1: I am told "EW are in their late 20's, a product of [the Indonesian] bridge goes to school programme"|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|pc|c6|nt|westjava: you are right, Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer needed to try and score small @H with spade ruffs, now -2|pg||
nt|westjava: we call it BMS (Bridge Masuk Sekolah = gridge goes to school)|pg||
nt|westjava: *bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: South must have something for her double: so North could play a trump to @HA|pg||
nt|mug: but ace was correct, no reason for North to lead away from @DK on this bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mamos: but the Club ruff might|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: West has to hod her cards up and of course not fly with q of diamonds- oops|pg||
nt|ahalim: although @H's are blocked|pg||
nt|ritong: as we can see, even 3@s is in jeopardy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|szalay: @D now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahalim: but can discard @H on the @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: other room NS play 3 NT make +400|pg||
nt|rmb1: But timing is on NS's side, they have two chances to draw trumps (now or later :))|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hm, the tables dont seem to be connected|pg||
nt|westjava: a technical problem....it's ok|pg||
nt|westjava: we've to restart|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|alnanda: yes.., now 1 losser @h pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: If they do not draw trumps now and South ruffs a club North must over ruff to draw trumps|pg||
nt|alnanda: brd 17 3NT +2 NS, 2 imp for Indonesia, brd 18 4@h-1, 9 imps for england|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahalim: 2 up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznx: I will close it come back shortly|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had overcalled the first time, West would have placed her partner with 6@d|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mug: any reason to think the score of 168-155 is not correct now?|pg||
nt|mug: with England winning ties|pg||
nt|mug: I'm told there was an appeal in the previous segment, I know nothing about that|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
nt|szalay: btw 2nd trump by South instead of @C wd be stronger defence|pg||
nt|subhranp: arvind should have kept the bidding open with prime controls and 5 carder support rather than shutting out the bidding|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 5d or 3nt|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: practice 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: this kind of hand generates a lot of accidents|pg||
mb|2S|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
nt|henryb:  A not unreasonable 3N for N-S, needing mostly the heart finesse, which is offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
nt|ritong: it is really good looking, for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: but the obvious danger is to drive too high|pg||
nt|henryb:  X = 3 card heart support|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne idée de Guy Lasserre,ce contre d'entame|pg||
nt|jjsb2: bonjour tout le monde :) |pg||
nt|farfie: bonsoir Sylvain|pg||
mb|3H|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
nt|jjsb2: c'est docn parti pour une mi temps probablement haletante et pleine de rebondissement ! |pg||
nt|rkj_0264: no chance of swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
nt|ritong: so, as long as pard is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: my policy with these is to take low road|pg||
nt|farfie: l'entame "naturelle" à !k donne une surlevée|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=886|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en passant un grand bravo aux femmes qui ont gagne la competition "venice cup" à 16 donnes de la fin |pg||
nt|jjsb2: bref ... :)|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici lasserre a cotnre 3@h est donc poizat est normalement obeissant |pg||
mb|4S|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising choice|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps the support double more or less infers long opening suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  rather than 2N?|pg||
nt|ritong: or double|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne nouvelle:5imps tombent dans notre escarcelle |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le cotnrat n''est pas tres claire a joue , les communications sont un peu bizarre |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: + 2?|pg||
nt|ritong: sticking to hcp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
nt|ritong: for once:)|pg||
nt|ritong: meaning " i want to stay in, but no clear path"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|d2|nt|farfie: plus que 8 points à refaire|pg||
nt|farfie: le déclarant n'est pas arrivé...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en fait j'ai tendance a pense , peut etre a tort, que le coup ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le meilleur jeu est peut etre pour le declarant de jouer R de T |pg||
nt|jjsb2: mais 1) ke ne trouve pas ca naturel et 2 je ne pense pas que cela suffise |pg||
nt|farfie: oui ça coupe les communications|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que R de T permet de gagner j'ai perso un gros dotue|pg||
nt|jjsb2: si on duque le R notamment |pg||
nt|farfie: certes|pg||
nt|farfie: en tous cas,jolie initiative de Guy Lasserre ce contre|pg||
nt|subhranp: with 4imps seperating the two teams, even OTs would matter here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznx: It's about 20 degrees Celsius in here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sry for the name of the match, I didnt do that|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: OR started twice, that was the problem|pg||
nt|alnanda: np paul.., thanks a lot :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lontoh 63: Thx Ruud ....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was ok too|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: how do you like that, stevie?|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: flat board|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: now 10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I rarely seem my P open 2! with such week @h and no distribution - also - dbl with no tricks in trumps I have seen many disastres|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: cant avoid heart ruff now - had to play 3rd heart before trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if @S win and return @H will make -1|pg||
nt|szalay: another imp for US|pg||
nt|szalay: sry, just push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: trump lead would have made life easier|pg||

nt|ritong: disciplined 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: USA know they are trailing, so pushing might be the only chance|pg||
nt|subhranp: 4s is normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sorry - i am having block- I seemed to have thought that dummy had only 2 hearts on last- ignore everything I said|pg||
nt|westjava: re hi all!|pg||
nt|ritong: pard also knows we are vulnerable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphznx: rehi|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@C forced 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: happily undoubled|pg||
nt|jjsb2: il est peut etre possible d'intervenir a  cette vulnerabilite avec la main d'Est egalement |pg||
nt|farfie: je pence que Philippe Poizat aurait du intervenir à @d dans cette position de vulnérabilité...il doit se reprocher le coup précédent|pg||
nt|farfie: pense|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici pour le coup comme on peut tous le coir 3@h ne joue pas "tres bien" |pg||
nt|jjsb2: je suis d'accord dominique |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Now West opens her 10 count and |pg||
nt|ritong: this @h 7 seems to come from blank suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3 @h could have and would have been -2 ,but not a place to pass for west -very difficult place |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think he will finesse in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 11 seems a lot of tricks in OR|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que l'enchere de 3@h est "douteuse" ... je suis aussi d'accord |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: when it s not a possible fourth best|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it can be a "forced" lead, so Q87 remains possible|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: West will regret opening in a minute|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@H was likely an ask for further description.|pg||
nt|ahalim: remember the Dutch ladies won the venice cup by 0,5 imp some years ago in bermuda|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on est intervenu par 3@d a l'autre table , je suis a peine surpris |pg||
nt|jjsb2: et c'est le cotnrat final |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: stopped just in time|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: very aggressive bidding in Open room|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, no first control in @C I think|pg||
nt|farfie: il aurait mieux valu effectivement attendre un éventuel réveil du partenaire|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: we have no official communication on the ruling 6@s was bid at both tables on Board ?  in the last stanza  by the Indonesians after a slow 5@S bid I think and England asked for a ...|pg||
nt|mamos: ruling|pg||
nt|subhranp: if DSM bid 4s on otherside and it gets chopped then it could be 5imps for IndMavs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: forced lead means that east might have @ss or @cs and be unwilling to lead in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: good lead it was|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4n/5c 0/3 and 5@D asking Q@S 6@C yes to Q plus k@C|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|mug: this is going to at least make to 2 more IMPs to Indonesia|pg||

nt|mamos: 10 tricks for West|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

mb|d|nt|runnerup: 5 1c really makes ,but i doubt that they will bid less |pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time, this time not so difficult to bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@S or 6@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: she claimed for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C hinges on the guess in @D |pg||
nt|yo_yo: DEwi shows both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S do you think?|pg||
nt|mamos: there may of course be an appeal  we don't know but at present England lead by 11 more imps than is shown here|pg||

mb|r|nt|runnerup: 5 @c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think she lost 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and nicola will bid  what|pg||
nt|jjsb2: avec des adversaires parlant autant peut etre allons nous echapper a ce cotnrat de 3Sa mort ne ? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: once North flew with heart ace there was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|alnanda: lost 2@h, 1@s,1@c and ruff @d|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now the road to 6@H or 6@S is opened wide after a 4@D bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: X might indicate @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: 7@d for -5|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: 150 looks very normal here|pg||

pc|dT|nt|alnanda: -6|pg||
nt|grebrof: french people are strange Henri - you always wear brown scarfs :D|pg||
nt|henryb:  The French N-S assayed 3N on board 4, goung down 2 when the heart was offsude|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on m'envoie 100 messages me disant que c'est obligatoire .. je n'en doute pas ... |pg||
pc|d2|nt|hlortz: e did not open in OR so 4@S escaped w/o X|pg||
nt|wstuart: -2 looks about right here.|pg||
nt|ritong: stayman followed with 2@s is an invite for them i think  north a bit short|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 2s or 3d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahalim: only 6 down|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ..|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and we have bread under our arm all the time|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
nt|grebrof: you make good bread thou . almost as good as the danish|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: in 4 @s defence should be like @h  lead -@s to Ace and @c .to beat it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahalim: worlclass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on shapely deals like this, having more aces is important|pg||
nt|mug: not sure this was good for the defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahalim: Ok next board please|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes WD nicola|pg||
nt|blewah: well done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR  Dhondy led A@D  so no guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nicola will claim when the next lead isnt ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: with @h K on he will lose three trumps and basta|pg||
nt|ritong: at most|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1s 3h 1c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: this can make if you guess everything right|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|rkj_0264: may make 9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 2 aces to come and make all 6 trumps on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: so still a long way to go in this match 10 more boards here and 16 more in the final stanza - with the teams turning over between three and four imps a board still very much ...|pg||
nt|mamos: anyone's match|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jjsb2: 3Sa a l'autre table pour info , entame @s |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blewah: not an obvious shift but that's the weakest suit on the table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h6|nt|mug: I think a spade back might have been logical, to kill entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|grebrof: not being able to opening 1nt with 5card major, will in many times give you rebid problems|pg||
nt|jjsb2: qui devrait etre a -1 ou moins 2 selon qu'on mette le V de @s ou pas |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|anton72: she can guess 4 cards in partner and i am agree ...diamond looks more normal not J @c|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dgame: 2 imps|pg||
nt|wstuart: After the Q to the K and teh J to the A, he will have to guess whether the 8 or the T is coming down next.|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: Luckily, N doesn't have the @DT or he might go -2.|pg||
nt|mug: she could have set up the long club I suppose|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d must be showing 1 or 2 4card M|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is, of course it gobbles up way less space, but situation is less clear for the opponents|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|ahalim: but who can argue with success Victor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT = a good raise|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nt mixed raise i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D - 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, some think its important to have 5-3 in the majors for allowing opening 1nt, but I haven see the problem to frequent I actually consider it|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: A @D lead will beat it 2 by force, but that's going to be hard to do.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  unless trumps are 5-0, declarer can count 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D - game only - both majors|pg||
nt|ahalim: after E opened 2NT quite possible to reach slam|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Senior had 6@D in her hand but back again....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the delay suggests I am wrong or is Neveena just excited by her super max|pg||

mb|6D|nt|runnerup: 6 @h went down by wrong guess in @s -board 6 -so Monaco got 13 insteat of Zeerob rood |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: vice versa|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe the delay was checking the system|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 control hand, not very often you have|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 3@h often includes a shortness  nice hit by chambers|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaker: 10 imps back|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: click on movies for board by board imps|pg||

nt|blewah: play will be very quick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: mais...|pg||
nt|ritong: oups|pg||
nt|grebrof: another reason is that we are conventional over the transfer in Norway so we do sometimes miss a 5-3 fit in the other major - with a GF hand at the responders hand I do have the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: perfect systtem for you  - lots of relays thou|pg||
nt|ritong: so, the contract looks bulletproof, so boyd tries to consider the worst which might happen|pg||

nt|runnerup: north did well by putting @d j away + for im|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d is GF any|pg||
nt|subhranp: some relief for the trailing team as Poddar on the other side have also not bid the game on Board8|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: dsm willpick some imps on this board|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|buddyshah: true|pg||

nt|buddyshah: paul is a young man of  25-26  i met him  in delhi....    has a lot of potential|pg||
nt|davidstern: 26|pg||
nt|buddyshah: ty david.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not to forget Nabil :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: 19|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he is 19 or 20?|pg||
nt|runnerup: game potentials both direction 4 @h 4 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Edgtton that is|pg||
nt|szalay: very good slam, especially after East's opening|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest never erasy to bid slam when opponents start with 1N, strong|pg||
mb|4D|nt|davidstern: 5@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they get too high here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: somebody tell me that D. Rosenberg does not belong in this competition ..... any reason for this.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: a normal board|pg||
nt|alnanda: still 7 board again, anything can happen|pg||
nt|davidstern: So a good battle to ensue|pg||
nt|buddyshah: X or 3@S?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so much for e/w bidding and making 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: is 5@C exclusion here?|pg||
nt|szalay: or spl? or nat?|pg||
nt|ritong: right spot is 6@c, icecold when trumps2/2|pg||
nt|ritong: now they can wnader in NTs, and now @h J on becomes useful|pg||
mb|4S|nt|runnerup: last bord here 4 @s ns with 20 points migth make at least after bad defence ..if you are optimistic -normally some 9 --3 @d is difficult|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT certainly shows hearts|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2NT shows a good hand of some sort - i suspect|pg||
nt|mwigor: (remember his range was 3-7)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6 will win|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong about our score, Paul?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: last round bd 16 was wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: technical difficulties|pg||
nt|westjava: as usual:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EAst might open 4@S with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 4@c making vs. 2NT +2 was worth 2 IMPs for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: as did Senior in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|buddyshah: Amazing result   from OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table played in 2 @d so -|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not sure of system but likely maximum|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2@S = MAX       and playing strenght to 3@H min.|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Interesting  3@C|pg||
nt|buddyshah: he wants to buy the contract|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 3@C = @C + @S      Inviting  4@S  thans  to Kib :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he planned a 3@s bid after 3@h|pg||
nt|szalay: ok to say ECL, when we have THIS hand|pg||
nt|ritong: avanti|pg||
nt|subhranp: precision 1c, 1s response is probably a transfer to 1n|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: Dewi upgrades her hand to 18 bal now|pg||
nt|farfie: je rappelle pour les kibs que les françaises ont gagné la Venice cup ,leurs adversaires n'ont pas souhaité jouer le dernier quart temps devant le retard accumulé|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: but when we have 8 good @Cs, its tough|pg||
nt|szalay: BRAVO!|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: kokish|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznx: but neither E nor W alerted 3@c|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hi brother hood|pg||
nt|mamos: England lead by 30 mps WE think  but WE are unofficial and know nothing|pg||
nt|mug: one of those "even-money" slams which in truth are much worse than even money|pg||
nt|mug: as you need the red suits to behave as well as @SA right|pg||
nt|ritong: but first, they have to reach a slam  not clearcut|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lontoh 63: you are right almondo|pg||

nt|odysseus69: looks right to start playing diamonds at trick 2|pg||
nt|mug: but I think you can make it if you need to|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry director in and I lost track... |pg||
nt|mug: when West shows up with void heart, you're going to finesse her for the @DQ I think|pg||

nt|blewah: just wanted to to distract you :)|pg||
nt|ritong: same goes:)|pg||
nt|subhranp: manoj may bid 1n here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|don_kapu: 1@S opening by S and may N reapond with 2@H|pg||
nt|westjava: and flat board again, don?|pg||
nt|ahalim: N trying to steal the @S;s|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is a good result for Indonesia, since North-South can make quite a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have good spade fit but East's @h honours are not working so well - East's 1@h overcall will warn West of this|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 5@c looks good|pg||
nt|mug: 2D I meant|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 4@s a l'autre table et je pense qu'ici se sera pareil |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the bidding looks odd on this board in the OR|pg||
nt|farfie: 3sa pas mal..|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lontoh 63: and 4 @S will be landing ..|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i rhink so oom west|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is funny for NS but not funny for EW|pg||
nt|ritong: so philippe passed 3@s, when it could easily stay there|pg||
nt|ritong: now, he has further info|pg||
nt|ritong: no, schermer prefers a standard psych|pg||
mb|d|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@c lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: peuyeum muda|pg||
nt|yo_yo: p p p 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eok: Well see. I also have G to deal with.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East might hit this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @hAQ have gone up in value|pg||
nt|blewah: S hand value has increased a lot after that 2@c|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT wont be a success I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  at the other table East bid 2@d to show majors, so North-South never bid clubs at all|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps it will :0|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyone opt for 4 @s wirg Ss hand?|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: -1|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: min|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: or @h 5|pg||
nt|westjava: odd and strange|pg||
nt|ahalim: the operator bid like that|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d 15-17 bal or 11/12-15 unbal|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it was just the final contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choices of 4@c, 5@c and 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: -6?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dgame: dont play @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: skinny game - well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: brown is looking very weird when seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West would like a @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: how did W infered that @s?|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like we all can get a last 4-5 boards in the most tied match ....Italy lead only 3 imps |pg||
nt|mug: needs to draw trumps or @S8 will be promoted|pg||
nt|mug: don't see how else she might reasonably play though|pg||
nt|mug: scratch that, @S9 is big enough |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps it was an invite, after all|pg||
nt|subhranp: he has 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|westjava: ok|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok operator error,  easy to do when they play fast |pg||
nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||
nt|ritong: guy lasserre went for the secret weapon  not sure it will be good|pg||
nt|ritong: criteria for weak twos are different from ours|pg||
nt|ritong: rebonjour|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on ne peut pas jeter assez de perdante sur les @h en pratique le cotnrat de 4@s ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: salut :) |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn:  so maybe East has spades, unless the dealing machine has eaten them all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|alnanda: still down, but must perfect defense |pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1 imps to moverick|pg||
nt|subhranp: diamond 76 will give him the 7th trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: this is going to be passed out :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed it was, though I would have thought East could bid 3@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|odysseus69: defence better be careful - as long as West ducks first diamond East can warn partner off spade return|pg||
nt|don_kapu: according to my brother hood, this is pancake board (flat board)|pg||
nt|westjava: @S9 lead other room|pg||
nt|ahalim: I think blewah shd become operator once|pg||
nt|westjava: tied money policy, moneter crisis, don|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a passed hand, South cannot be much better than she is. who would be bidding 2@c rather than 1NT?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nonvul vs vul probably more temting|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je pense que As de @d et @d vient probablement assez bien ici mais je suis influence par les jeux |pg||
nt|farfie: petit @d serait terrible..|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|don_kapu: flat board|pg||
nt|dburn:  still time to take plenty of tricks for the defenders|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alnanda: Q@h !!|pg||
nt|jjsb2: cela dit il y a quand meme pas mal de cas assez simple ou cela fait chuter .. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|blewah: raising directly @c would have work better, it seems|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|blewah: i don't think i would be strong enough to do it oom Arifin|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe 1 imp for England|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok then pls don't say operator's error|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe the toughest job in bridge|pg||
nt|westjava: agreed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|westjava: btw, live score : USA-2 Senior leads 228.5 - 174 VP vs Ina Senior|pg||
nt|westjava: senior live score : http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=QF&qroundno=1&qtournid=887|pg||

nt|ritong: il y a bien 128 donnes au programme? je demande confirmation, car le bandeau annonce 6/6|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je confirme que c'est le dernier segment |pg||

pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: not clear message unless that was suit pref for hearts|pg||

nt|jjsb2: un petit coup de 1imp Henri :) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: now a massacre|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok small children are not allowed to watch this|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi was really a tough girl|pg||
nt|westjava: fasten your seat belt pls|pg||
nt|dgame: hard to breath|pg||
nt|blewah: prohibiting EW entering the auction. but 3@c is not an option|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South would have liked her @h honours but the the singleton in partner's suit|pg||
nt|blewah: while 4@c or 5@c risk missing 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|blewah: I didn't say it Oom|pg||
nt|subhranp: that was a bad heart discard|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mug: my open room correspondent tells me Smith and Brock are not in slam on the previous board|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: ça ne fâche pas|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: having decided to open 1D I dont think South should volunteer 2D - pass would simply show a minimum with long diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: is declarer going to ruff some @S?|pg||
nt|blewah: @d lead holds this to 10 tricks only|pg||
pc|h9|nt|subhranp: missed the chance of 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1 imp to moverick|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|subhranp: this deal illustrates importance of lower cards like 6 and 7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|westjava: they still have Trans National event|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  yes South will be expecting North to be short in @h rather than @s|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn:  well, maybe - but the opponents are not bidding like people with eight hearts|pg||
nt|subhranp: now making|pg||
pc|hT|nt|alnanda: welldone :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn:  so North ought to be at worsr 2=2=5=4|pg||

nt|ritong: ain t that cute|pg||

nt|dburn:  but so far no one has bid those except West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find after West bid the suit|pg||
nt|subhranp: interesting last board, both sides have big fit in either minor but neither side makes game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb2: mais sans encombre est bien sur de trop .. tout les IMP vont comptes , c'est certains ! |pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: last board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: dbl showing 5-7 hcp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
nt|mug: I wonder why Dhondy didn't upgrade this hand to an opening 1NT?|pg||
nt|grebrof: good bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: si ils nous refont le plan de la demi finale, je prendrai quelques jours de repos|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
nt|farfie: je ne pense pas qu'ils vont entamer ça,dans l'autre salle|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be tempted to save with the east hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N shaking her head, she didn t want to alert 3@s :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: most likely go drn, but|pg||
nt|ritong: good chances of a duplicated auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so, gathering maximum of tricks in order  making it not that relevant|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, bye all|pg||
nt|ritong: presumably 2@d shows 5@h when 2@h would show 6+|pg||
nt|jjsb2: oui pardon j'ai dit sans encombre en considerant que l'entame @h ne venait pas "facilement"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jjsb2: entame @s à l'autre table |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|blewah: unfavorable vulnerability. a bit conservative maybe by S, though|pg||
nt|ritong: now the toughes part  make it|pg||
nt|ritong: toughest*|pg||
nt|ritong: finding @hs was tough already|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: ah well, they got there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: didnt do so well last time- does that affect her?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this board should be quits, well played poddar.|pg||
nt|subhranp: manoj should drop CK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||
nt|dburn:  oh, I don't say I would want to be in it either - I am also an old coward|pg||
pc|c5|nt|farfie: bon...tant pais|pg||
pc|c6|nt|farfie: pis|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|westjava: yes sir! we get ready!:)|pg||
nt|ritong: situation is supermurky for shermer  the @c 8 is not readable|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer  sry|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was, he would have underlead his @d A confidently|pg||
nt|ritong: underled*|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, i do not think the contract can be beaten up to that point|pg||
nt|ritong: not by technical ways, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the fact that this @c Jack mighta been useful as en entry to @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: board 10 proved too difficult for americans as well no (big) swing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 1+@c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphznx: that how it went|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahalim: hey hey peace on earth|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Nicola will be expecting bad breaks from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer::(|pg||
nt|ritong: pard has the darn @d K, but poof|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: i talk about lasserre's state of mind|pg||
nt|ritong: his prebalancing action is obvious, imho, and contract will very likely be the same next room|pg||
nt|ritong: so will be the opening lead, at first sight|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the other hand I am in the camp which advocates an opening bid on North so no sympathy when passing costs game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blewah: ruff out some @ds would be my line, can go to hand with trump|pg||
nt|blewah: to table, I mean|pg||
nt|westjava: Venice other SF, France leads 84 - 46.5 imps vs Netherland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the x ruff will work as it happens|pg||
nt|ritong: so his target is to make as many tricks as reasonably possible, then compare scores|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mug: some pairs simply don't open 1NT with a 5-card majors, for example the three pairs on the Italian open team|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|westjava: Bali waiting all of us|pg||
nt|blewah: they are becoming minority day by day, i think|pg||
nt|blewah: as 5M332 is gaining popularity all over the world|pg||
nt|blewah: for 1nt, I mean|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rkj_0264: -11|pg||
nt|subhranp: going down and looks like mavs will bow down to the might of DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks everyone for joining in|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: moverick shd resign|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blewah: in CR after garbage stayman Murniati gave up to 2@d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ianco: could  hVE BEEN -2|pg||
nt|ianco: knowing  9@S with ptr  he  should have played @H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: think of you as a mere youth David|pg||
nt|mug: Indonesia are in 4@S on 27 too so that leaves this flattish looking board and four more for England to recover 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aramesh|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, this goes for any given board, but sometimes you have a feeling your spot is not that obvious to reach, and thus a sacrifice of one trick or two, if it ensures the gain, ...|pg||
nt|ritong: can be envisaged|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: so -1 but 2 imps to EW and England|pg||
nt|blewah: i wonder what dbl would mean in their agreement|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ianco: any one ,  who are the other semifinalists?|pg||

nt|rkj_0264: 3nnt fr ns|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: dsm|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn:  this is a slam more or less flat out on a finesse|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@h opening and what will E doing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1D x is the start - but where it ends?|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: ok pass|pg||
nt|dburn:  not the most exciting set of boards, this - but with the match as close as it is, a couple of part-score swings could well decide the issue|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 6d|pg||
nt|drkvas:  yes this is the only way to get to6@d n it makes:)|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: raju will try|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: s....still thinking|pg||
nt|ianco: 6@D      is cold as cards are    and facing VUL 3@D   raju   shall try|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: raju style overbidding|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: he will bid 6d|pg||
nt|drkvas:  vul 1st in hand 3@d was imaginative with that suit:)|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: raju cnt miss|pg||
mb|6D|nt|westjava: dbl by w?|pg||
nt|blewah: weak raise|pg||
nt|blewah: this may avoid EW from unmakeable 3nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West will probably x|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe yes maybe no, depend on what she drink before|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: P - 1@D - P - 1@H|pg||

nt|blewah: 5@d has a chance|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohh i see, pure nice water|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: no smell of vodka|pg||

nt|ritong: .|pg||

nt|jjsb2: on jouera probablement 4@s ici , c'est le cotnrat joue à l'autre table pour info |pg||
nt|ritong: il ne peut donc rien arriver de mauvais|pg||
nt|drkvas:  wd  so poddars woes continue:(|pg||
nt|drkvas:  play is routine|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: vwd raju|pg||
pc|cA|nt|westjava: hard to bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 7@D always loose 1@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even in third seat, South opens with her poor 12|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d by S?|pg||
nt|mug: 1@D was nebulous so South was put off trying 2@D |pg||
pc|c3|nt|westjava: welldune|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't think you have to get to 4@s(which went close)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|don_kapu: can u keep it|pg||
nt|blewah: now all she has to do is make it|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but i think E has drink a little blood of dragon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say  for the @D suit|pg||
nt|dburn:  low to the jack is normal|pg||
nt|westjava: so, the new leader, again?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s K does not look good, and @h xxx not a bonus|pg||
nt|grebrof: I gues 3@s also how @Hs - not my style, but you better play the sam as your partmrt|pg||
nt|ritong: @s K does not look good because opponents presumably hold nine of them, therefore it will not be an active card  better be elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: now choice is restricted:)|pg||
nt|grebrof: if east has somrthing left to offer. he bids again - does he?|pg||
nt|ritong: he makes me sweating|pg||
nt|ritong: connection off?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||

pc|s4|nt|nkgupt: 5 more to usa1 for this 2@d|pg||

nt|ritong: sauf s il entame l as de @c|pg||
nt|ianco: S now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dgame: 2 top controls on @s|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h lead make problem for declerer|pg||
nt|ritong: on voit pas pourquoi il ferait ça|pg||
nt|jjsb2: entame qui ne vient pas naturellement il faut bien l'admettre :) |pg||
nt|ritong: s il plonge, c est pas bon non plus ( pour eux)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: 1nt is ok, but I rather dbl neg with Ns hand|pg||
nt|ritong:  |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dreaded slam on finesse board - my pet hate|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this is worse if @c led|pg||
pc|sT|nt|odysseus69: Rolands law- bid it when right  dont when wrong|pg||
nt|dgame: dewi is digging it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in reality a fractin less than 50% - 6-1 club break - not massive - reduces it a fraction|pg||
nt|blewah: N could have tried 2@c though|pg||
nt|blewah: 54+ in minors|pg||
nt|ianmcc: best to settle for -200|pg||
nt|ianmcc: take 6@d & @c|pg||
nt|ritong: on voit pas pourquoài il ferait ça, non plus|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ils sont pas marrant les americains , ils ne font pas les choses qu'ils ne devraient pas faire :) |pg||
nt|ritong: pour l instant, ils font la seule chose qu ils ne devraient pas faire|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: la partie est de tres haut niveau dans les deux salles|pg||
nt|jjsb2: oui Jean Paul je suis plus que d'accord.. ca joue reelement tres bien |pg||
nt|ritong: être derrière au score|pg||
nt|ritong: pourvu que ça dure, dit il en toute impartialité|pg||
nt|jjsb2: le declarant va probablement essayer de trouve AKx chez l"ouveur à @c |pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: ABCC in Bali 2012 is open tournament|pg||
nt|westjava: so, this board will be push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South did not fancy a weak NT in third seat vulnerable with 12 - not sure of the logic for preferring 1@d to 1C though|pg||
nt|blewah: yes to some questions, NS play weak NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn:  but on this auction North is marked with the king|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good start for declarer - can switch to spades now|pg||
nt|drkvas:  credit to lal for his imaginative 3@d 6@d is semi auto matic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: nonetheless NS find themselves in a pretty good spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  possible pick up for Indonesia|pg||
nt|ianmcc: going for throat|pg||
nt|ritong: chambers wondering what s going on in @hs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn:  at the other table 1NT could have been made easily enough, but dummy had to discard on three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: some uncalled for undertricks coming|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|don_kapu: how do you when it is right or wrong ? law of The Egg of Colombus|pg||
nt|dburn:  and declarer kept all of North's diamonds and then misguessed the suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer got the @d wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn:  so that she lost four spades and one of everything else|pg||
nt|blewah: continue with @c now?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe west has led from 62|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: not sure I understand the OR bidding - East did not appear to be doing enough but maye 3H was a max or min over 3C -some play this and 4H is in middle|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Depok, this bidding style we call Dewi Persik Digging|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sdh finisse again @d, |pg||
nt|dburn:  and South probably has some shortage for the jump to 3@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  so, declarer may very well go right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Has to finesse @S now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dgame: hehehe|pg||
nt|don_kapu: am i right boer Alnando ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: and in Medan ?|pg||
nt|alnanda: +1 now|pg||
nt|grebrof: sorry to say: when your P bid twice and you have the best trumpsuit t the table. why pass?|pg||
nt|ianco: more  woes  to    poddar|pg||
pc|d2|nt|blewah: lots of finesses|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|don_kapu: in Medan we call Sapurata|pg||
pc|d5|nt|don_kapu: line of play, develop side suit, in this case @D|pg||
nt|alnanda: uncle don always right..:)|pg||
nt|dgame: vivid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sapurata = to be or not to be|pg||
nt|odysseus69: new leader |pg||
nt|mug: the defence is disconnected, a club to the king now is the seventh trick|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Oh no|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: possible missund about 3@d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|don_kapu: wkat happened if N return small @d now|pg||
nt|ianco: why credit? because it works here?\|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|don_kapu: what|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but can't score both @h and @d|pg||
nt|ritong: not exactly so, though|pg||
nt|drkvas:  only way to reach 6@d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dgame: clm|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|blewah: @cK now and @d finesse|pg||
nt|blewah: @cJ i mean to discard @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: @c j for @s discard ?|pg||
nt|blewah: very restricted options|pg||
nt|don_kapu: will you finisse @d blewah ?|pg||
nt|westjava: if she make, 13 imps|pg||
nt|blewah: with that 3@h from S, probably will|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this hand is really exciting!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: the last 3 boards, injury time, don?|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1NT in both rooms for England?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: P - 1@D - 1@H - North (??)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: this is a very funny hand :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|yo_yo: I feel 2NT is correct but Sally wont want to miss game|pg||
nt|don_kapu: whats your westjava|pg||
nt|dburn:  if North-South can bid a lot of spades, East-West may find slam hard to reach|pg||
nt|blewah: OK. in RR 21, Bojoh - Tueje were benched|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: of course they are going to be in a failing slam |pg||

nt|dburn:  but West has a pretty good hand - if 5NT meant pick a slam, she might do that|pg||
nt|ritong: and, indeed, +10 for having naively led his long suit:-)|pg||
nt|ianco: 1@S may be denying 4@S|pg||
nt|ianco: i mean 4 carder |pg||
mb|2S|nt|blewah: 3nt is an impressive score from Closed Room|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, that jack of hearts may be promoted on the bidding|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 8 tricks in @s was good going|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no West dredged up a pass- or is 1D forcing?|pg||
nt|blewah: and repeated here|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ok|pg||
nt|dburn:  not in practice, but fortunately that does not matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: welcome blewah...You come at the right time, seeing results, the indonesia audience can release the tension with drink BLEWAH with ice and syrup :) :)|pg||
nt|dgame: yes, |pg||
nt|yo_yo: SAlly  will win and take her winners|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 5@D 1@H 4@C = 10 tricks, am i right brother westjava|pg||
nt|ritong: brave call|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: normal choice of lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: so many chat to me and i will repeated it|pg||
nt|grebrof: well Henri, you been in this game for what is it - 50 years ? you rather lead a tight 6 carder than a brokem 4 carder - yes?|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no clear rule|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre hoped the surprise effect would work  it did not|pg||
nt|ritong: hence " secret weapon"|pg||
nt|jjsb2: a l'autre table ou joue 3@h |pg||
nt|ritong: piganeau pourrait ouvrir|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: what is 2s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: Indonesia missed 4@S on  28 so that's 6 or 7 to England, depending on the overtricks|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1s|pg||
nt|ianco: now  2@S  makes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn:  not sure what 4NT means - probably takeout, but even so...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East must have a near maximum pass to X 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: Nicola might kno w what this means   dont|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she will not like her @h if that is the deciding factor|pg||
nt|dburn:  ...if this is the way to try for slam in hearts, Smith may be put off by the quality of her trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  she may think there is the @sA and 1 @h to lose|pg||
nt|blewah: 4nt and then 5@h must be bigger than a direct 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, partner should have five clubs for this auction, and in general when partner makes a slam try and you have the ace and king of her main suit, you should bid a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  because she must have most of the rest|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point and East has nothing wasted in @s|pg||
nt|dburn:  for all that, East made a good decision at the other table|pg||
nt|blewah: while 4@sX could have been down 5! as Georgia said|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the surface 1 down but....|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn:  well done|pg||
nt|drkvas:  like zia says if ur in heat 3 bid what u think is rt it works if not lie low|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|don_kapu: pohhh npw 2@H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this has no play so 3 IMPs for US|pg||
pc|s3|nt|don_kapu: go go Indonesia ..... 3 more boards ...|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Selamat buat Tim Putri Indonesia..Kami Semua Bangga dengan Perjuangan Kalian.!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 now|pg||
nt|mamos: England suporters smile|pg||
nt|jjsb2: li suffit de le gagner ce qui apparait tout a fait dans les cordes de lasserre |pg||
pc|s2|nt|blewah: 2 hearts, Don|pg||
nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: East thought 4N showed minors and didnt know what after 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: il a ouvert une main moins bonne dans la meme position de vulnérabilité dans le segment précédent|pg||
pc|sA|nt|don_kapu: ga usah xx atau aneh2..sdh llos|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now|pg||
nt|ianmcc: specs are keen on this making. Let's see|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: cool slam here|pg||
nt|ritong: american momentum|pg||
pc|s4|nt|don_kapu: i see|pg||
nt|mug: declarer would have done better to overtake that and play a diamon|pg||
nt|anton72: good news for england|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe 2 down now|pg||
nt|ritong: saves chamberzs from a painful decision  bien joué|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: stop don, enough|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@H chance a good save for EW I think|pg||
nt|jjsb2: il a ouvert je confirme henri |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: contrat 3 @h en salleouverte|pg||
nt|ritong: tres bien|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: specs very keen!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|anton72: board 28 indonesia stop in 2 @s|pg||
nt|ritong: one round of trumps then gling|pg||
nt|grebrof: me neither, except it is much easier for your Pif you lead from somethimg you have-  rather than guessing leading a suit your P mever bid :S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: good idea to switch despite the disappointing outcome|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: it loks asif this match will remain close and tense into the final stanza |pg||
nt|anton72: bad is ...no Vull :)|pg||
nt|anton72: 6 or 7 imps back|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: ça ne peut que les gêner  apparemment, ça a été le cas|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: that club not needed but no harm|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: première balle de break, donc|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|don_kapu: take K and must play @D K to make 21s|pg||
nt|ritong: gling is the claim sound effect|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: not such a good idea to continue|pg||
nt|ritong: et un service gagnant|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: cashing the clubs would have inconvenienced declarer|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe even beyond - the official score is Indonesia 132 - England 155.5, but there may be an appeal against a Director's ruling|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: what else but ace of diamonds?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dgame: @c|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: to poddar|pg||
nt|drkvas:  40 in 14 is the target|pg||
nt|ianco: ty all      poddars  have task cutout in next 14|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 2 imps to poddar|pg||
nt|drkvas:  1|pg||
nt|ianco: 1|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: double digit to poddar|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lontoh 63: yg sakit jantung di larang nonton @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dgame: 4 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be 100% safe I think |pg||
pc|c3|nt|dgame: sorry all got to go|pg||
nt|dgame: bye|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn:  but of course, with that half IMP of carryover, we are highly likely at least to avoid extra boards|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: that was better|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: probably chambers would have reopened, but easier that way|pg||
mc|8|nt|drkvas:  thx all the wonderful kibs fred n ronald from bbo  bfi n sree cements from india n our excellent operators cu tom|pg||
