mb|p|nt|gluckenval: Fantunes's system is a conv. one... they didn't change their agreements since 2001 more or less :) any opening bids at level 1 is usually 14+ (with ecceptions), 1NT weak 12-14 with ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 5M too, and the openings bid at level 2 are in the range 10-13|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with DBL promising points/values @s game wouldn't be an overbid|pg||

nt|penseur9: I would remind all that we have no online results available for this tournament|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a rule: opps play without seeing our cards !|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 13 tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am actually just thrown into this, si I have to admit I dont know the district here - or is it different districts competing towards eachother?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may produce a swing since 4@h appears to make for NS|pg||
mb|2C|an|relay|nt|vugraphzph: Sorry for the bug|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: as we miss aunction we just display final contract on this board |pg||
mb|2D|an|12-13|nt|santyclz: Did w actually bid 2@H on that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: East wondering what is happening here!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 5@s can win without a @d lead. 6S cannot|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this 3 @d was not from lessons in bridge-book -but looks winner|pg||

mb|p|nt|gluckenval: the pair from Russia uses Precision club with 1@C 16+ and 1NT 12-15 in 1/2 pos, 15-17 3/4|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not dbl 2c?|pg||
nt|frm: Er det ikke fuldt tilstrækkeligt at melde 4 SP ovenpå 3 NT? (Ville 3 SP ovenpå 2 RU i øvrigt have været krav efter Ø-V´s system?|pg||
mb|3D|an|4!d|nt|paulg:  excited that I'm doing USA 1 vs USA 2 :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow you are?|pg||
nt|paulg:  with Roland and Bill|pg||
nt|baldjean: this auction only works if in your methods a double of 1@h always mean 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: means*|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: why?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has a good playing trick hand - 3@h a possibility   |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but too good def. i think its right to pass|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB likely would make t his with @S to 9 . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Both methods have  plusses and minuses.|pg||
nt|paulg:  which, with all due respect, is not as intimidating as doing it with Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Thorvald Aagaard|pg||
nt|thorvald: Hi|pg||
nt|pelu: Its not the danish league, but the winners from 11 districks in Denmark + 1 team extra from the defensing distrikt - round robin 11x12 boards - no KO|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1003.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: probably 1nt-p-2kl-p-2h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4@s is still a slamtry in my world|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: E is Zia, for those asking|pg||
nt|psyck: Fantunes, Welland/Zia ,Helgemo/Helness, Quantin/Bompis , Bessis x2, Smirnov/Piekarek, Bertheau/Nystrom, Brogeland, Versace etc feature in this tourney... |pg||
nt|psyck: a 9 match round robin a,omg 10 teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  Matias, do we know if 2@h was polish style showing 5@h and 5 of another?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonjour|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT is 11-14 - and EW never have max :) - then they upgrade :)|pg||
nt|othered1: nice shift|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ybob: level 3 is short by 1 trick for both side|pg||
nt|sybarra: but difficult to stay off the 3 level imo |pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S = 110 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: which fits the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too, but I know some people who would|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|penseur9: playing low spades to try and prevent declarer to go to dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: claims ruffing a @c and a @s|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|Zmud99: Hi Rashed|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|othered1: @C back w ill be easy, since west can count declarer's tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  S, with a strong NT hand and controls, needed to do more in this auction|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|hantveit: not a nice start for NS. and yesterday they lost the victory on the last hand...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hantveit: ?|pg||
nt|santyclz: That doesn't look right...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Though it didn't matter.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: commentating with LC is cool! he does it all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  I saw Versace say that playing in 2NT is considered a sin in Italy |pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  he is doing the final match on Sunday, Italy vs Bulgaria|pg||
nt|hedyg: well EW are French...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I am at the other table|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzsa: 2@h was not alerted|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: standing: Aakirkeby 62, Odense 60, Aarhus 57, BK Nord (Aalborg) 56, Haderslev 52|pg||
nt|dkkello:  They found a 6 Club in Bermuda Bowl , many years ago after pas -pas 1 @H from Peter with 12 point , the best bidding sequence that year |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  EW had good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: different countries, different sins|pg||
nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
nt|pelu: and Martin Schaltz (the son) also on the Odense Team|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead with singleton @S don't need - with xx in @S more chance to beat the contract leading @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@H is a possible lead because North know that East is strong, so probably find the K in @h in North hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, in modern times people are not very timid about their weak openings - can be 5, can be 6, can be 5-5 or whatever - personally I suggest you diverce them|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: good start for BK Nord|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|hantveit: Even if north showed 0-7 and 5h, south should bid 4h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The format of this tournament is that every district have a competition to find out which team should represent them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The district who is defending champion get to send two teams|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1001.html for standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: If you bid with that hand I think it's because you dont feel as comfortable in defense as you do as declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: lucky|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ybob: nice 4@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do EW play a weak or strong NT....ah, weak|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: alert said 10-13 |pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR on previous board, south did play @S to 9 at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and David Edwin|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: 7N, 7@c and 7@h N/S. Will they find it?|pg||

nt|xenya: 2 relatively easy hands so far|pg||

nt|thorvald: Looks like NS kan make a slam in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Herve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Probably not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: What a start to this 12 board match!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Bærentsen taking his time :) I understand his problem|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I prefer 2 @S from E anyday|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW don't play normal negative doubles, as dbl seems to be a replacement bid for 1@S, likey in a transfer response structure (at lest after overcall)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: ah ok|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bill|pg||
nt|baldjean: now it gets interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: in OR, W only bid 3@S but of course E raised to game |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Zmud99: There's 2 session in this Patton - Session A (afternoon) and Session B ( tonight ) - Each session play 4 matches of 8 boards - Session A and B best teams will qualify for tomorrow |pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Roland welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1002.html  standings after 7 rounds of 11|pg||

pc|h3|nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 HCP both sides and likely NT.|pg||
nt|pelu: only 12 tricks NS on lead @CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: E knows his partner (not bidding on to 3@s) or what do you think?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
nt|pelu: EWs Cc say Acol standard, but the play 5 card major (and that is NOT Acol)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but I dont now their system |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but the two teams cannot come from one club|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1|pg||
nt|hantveit: Good decision of south here to open 1s. 7 losers an 4S is often playable if partner holds support|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: BK 1936 and Odense BK come from the same district|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H=transfer to 3@S, but South would probably have raised anyway |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW play 10-13 1st and 2nd seat NV|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi!   12 clubs are playing round robin for the titel ...from various districts of Denmark|pg||

nt|dkkello:  could have stold the pot|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: weird bidding by E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S is safe|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s doesn't make because of the 4-1 @s break|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: he overcalled :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|hedyg: the last CC we have for NS is : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed for the contract.|pg||
nt|thorvald: Good old Leo Pedersen that recommend that if you have an ace against a slam, lead it|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry not even on that lead :(|pg||
nt|othered1: Game is good enough here, objective is holding ponted suit losers to one.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Rankings before last match : 1) White House 137  2) Bonori  136  3) Zimmermann 133  4) De Botton 129  5) Patane 126  6) Italia School 124  7) GIB 121  8) Ward Platt 120  9) Corsica ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 120  10) Brondi  116    Top 6 teams qualify for Quarter Final tomorrow ( plus 2 teams from Patton B )|pg||
nt|dkkello:  North and East are well known to bid a lot |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be looking at this with interest, particularly the fact that NS are vulnerable|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||
nt|kjadams: close game here.   Spade lead should scuttle it.|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi CK and John-wlc|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks ara|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1S, 2D and 1C loser in 4H, might be imps back to ns here, as 4S is a possible contract in open|pg||
nt|grebrof: almost like out team champs in Norway, except its a cup where the locals play eacchother the first rounds and then the away team has to travel further and further - leaving 8 teams ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: where the hometeam (the event changes site every year) is prequalified|pg||
nt|grebrof: Trond here has actually won this event in Norway|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has some work to do to make sure not to go down more than one|pg||
nt|hantveit: the negative in my opinion is that they place the final in small places with little or no spectators, and with a long travel for the players|pg||
nt|andyv:  a trump lead by S would probably have been better.|pg||
nt|grebrof: cant say I like Ws 2@h - for me 3@h is obvious|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3@h does take away the cue bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I have too say that I think I would bid 4S over my partners 3h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, he has passed - oh well|pg||
nt|xenya: same lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Hervé|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: @S suit internal solidarity being a key|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we should se some "funny" biddings from them ..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I don't count|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2 in NS....and 1 is operating :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont understand Es bidding - never supported pd opening with @SKQ3??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slam need a help by opps|pg||

nt|penseur9: if you don't Roland... where do I stand :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Zmud99: Standings after Round 8/9 : 1) Gladysh 140  2) Zimmermann 138  3) White House 138  4) Ventin 122  5) Marill 120  6)  Vainikonis E  117  7) De Botton 114  8) Welland  112  9)  ...|pg||

nt|runnerup: west has already shown 1 ace -so time to give ruff -wd|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Operator is?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: most lines work here...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Nathalie Frey is operating :)  Venice cup winner in Estoril :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sex change operation? it reads Frederic in his/her profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts and 4+ in a minor|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hedyg: well, that is by the way|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|thorvald: Yes, but against players jumping to slam it might still be valid|pg||

pc|s6|nt|psyck: once he saw @st, no more probs for dec|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d with indicated @s lead look quite fine|pg||

mb|p|nt|ybob: @D ruff|pg||

nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
nt|thorvald: That wasnt a clever double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: partner will bid 5@c|pg||
nt|thorvald: With 4-card support it is almost always better to bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 1@D is possible by West|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ybob: hard to plat 3NT when opps bid 4@H|pg||

nt|thorvald: 5@D asking for a lead against 5@S D would even be better|pg||

nt|andreasw:  i dont get W at all.. he must put partner with a trick after switching to another suit then @d.. then why not just play a small @D first? even thought he problebly only will get 5@d it will go down the when putting partner with a trick?...|pg||
nt|famus: so Thuillez draw first blood|pg||
nt|famus: tx--bye--i wud also slip out:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i was wrong as usual|pg||
mb|2N|an|ms|nt|penseur9: oups... same at other table :(|pg||
nt|kjadams: the other table shifted to clubs vs game which gave up the extra trick.|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if one pair stops in 2@H and the other reaches 3@H, it's just that the pair in 3 loses imps sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 5 imps for stopping low on board 2.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Duplication error on board 3 - we will go to board 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Another slam board. Who dealt these cards?!|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT |pg||
nt|othered1: We've all been in worse contracts than a vul 4@S here, but it won't fetch this time.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hantveit: anoth biggy here|pg||
nt|hantveit: but as noone is holding a longer suit, it is harder to bid it.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i have more confidence in them reaching 3NT this time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hi|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, the result is that you miss 4-4 fits in @s when opener has minimum, but you gain more information about the opening hand rather than the 1nt-3nt : which fails more often than ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: most think|pg||
nt|baldjean: my partner and I use pre-transfers to majors when transfering to minors. Example: 1nt -2@h-2@s-3@c is a transfer to @d and not to @s|pg||
nt|xenya: fit jump by E|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: interest |pg||

mb|p|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hantveit: it should not be bid either I think... what do you guys mean?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing she had made a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 1@s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Could have led clubs once, but not twice, if lead Q.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
nt|tez: if they play 1@c 1@d 1NT(May have 4 card major) ...they could stop in 3 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  2, the CR in 2@H +2 for 7 IMPs Las Girafes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N/S can probably make 6@h here, but it's a difficult spot to reach|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you find this gives the opps more doubling opportunities? |pg||
nt|othered1: At least not on a single-cummy basis|pg||
nt|othered1: single-dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: seven is only on if no club lead, trumphs breaking 3-2 and heart 3-3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally weak NT is 10/12|pg||
nt|famus: always -1 i think?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a reasonable 4@S -- but doomed|pg||
nt|othered1: They've found @H, which has no chance at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry was checking why 3NT was -3 last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 1@s is diamonds or 3 controls?|pg||
nt|kjadams: interesting 3S call here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: quite strong and with a side 4 card major.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i'll withdraw that comment :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder what Walsh has to do with 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess, bypass 4 card or longer @d suit?|pg||

nt|grebrof: 5M|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Matias...that has so long not been an alert in the states I had forgotten about it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The normal method in DK is that 1D denies a major suit if youre not invit+|pg||

mb|p|nt|caruga: un numerone|pg||
nt|thorvald: What would you lead ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kjadams: 2S here looks like a transfer to clubs, with 2N showing an accept of a club game invite.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, that was the only swingy hand with the slams & games on other boards being fairly strightforward|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks for the taking with the club Q dropping.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand this one ... 5@C is the spot, NOT 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: *les...|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C unlucky for e/w   spade ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody's 4@s.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
nt|grebrof: I actually played a system where 2@d was transfer to all colours, except 7-9hp and 5card @h/@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
nt|hedyg: unfortunately we have no system card or CC for EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so no game makes ... VERY tough hand :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Tomorrow we will start broadcasting at 14.03|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about 4@S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 4@S is hopeless.  Everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their best chance is probably to get to 5@C and hope that the defence mis-steps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  can in fact make    diamonds can be ruffed out  king an extra discard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it can ... there aren't enough entries.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: likel make now with no @H ruff.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|kjadams: The zimmerman team has been one of the top teams in the world in the last couple years.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand on which to get a coffee.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 2@h probably was penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good spot|pg||
nt|baldjean: W is understandibly reluctant with going to 3nt here, the @d are not that great here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
nt|kjadams: The are a threat to win any event they have entered.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide who has the long diamonds; if north has them, you hold up since the heart finesse is into south|pg||
nt|vbman: normally most play dbls after nt opener as take out|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3@c is 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looking for @s with partner|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, I thought so|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, i spoke too soon|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 11 top tricks. |pg||
nt|hantveit: that is a 0,25X0,68x0,53 % (plus stiff spade j)|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 5 in spades, 4 i dia, 2 in H and one in C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think the ACBL took it off the alert sheets in 1985|pg||
nt|othered1: Hello, everybody!|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ed|pg||
nt|famus: Hi ed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|runnerup: no science -so that even if 2 @s are off -who guesses to lead that|pg||
nt|paulg:  they could have played in 3NT anyhow ... 3@d with @dxxx was not a great description of the hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe there are ... I'll take that back|pg||
nt|grebrof: I play Waksh myself - most bids after 1@d is GF|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1nt will quickly be 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|penseur9: fortunatly 3NT is a south lead, might have a chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, they've reached a reasonable contract, but of course Nunes was not going to lead a spade into a bid and raised suit|pg||
nt|ady: take 8 tricks cheapest|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: bravo|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: now north may shift to a spade|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gluckenval: here we are...|pg||
nt|stoffers: very important trick coming up..|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ofcause in good day you can meke this |pg||
nt|penseur9: with a @S return might promote a 9th... I'm a born optimist :)|pg||
nt|athene: he needs his partner to have an entry and some tricks somewhere - spades or clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Yes, I need more caffeine!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm tempting to approach the table and see Dubinin'd eyes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|famus: aleast we have a genuine expert:)|pg||
nt|famus: pretty boring hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting how both NS pairs weren't able to get into auction, despite a fine play for a vul 5@D.  Even strong sounding bids can be preemptive |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|stoffers: Told you :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: wd|pg||
nt|stoffers: Wd|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh. yes!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vbman: well  placed black kings will turn this hand into an battle|pg||
nt|famus: was there a case for S to bid 3NT over 3@Hs--suggesting a minor suit struggle--or wud that be stretching more than required???|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  my kibitzers are certain that 1@s is conventional, even if they cannot agree on the specific meaning|pg||
nt|penseur9: are we seing the right bidding here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are, they overbid a little|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Yes...|pg||
nt|penseur9: this contract a a slight chance but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would not make either|pg||
nt|penseur9: will Fantoni lead trump here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done by Angelini to make 5@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then easier, spade lead much better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North did not overcall in the other room, a bit strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much does one need to overcall I wonder|pg||
nt|penseur9: I suppose that both rooms bidding can qualify as surprising... possibly strange :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is  1 in the world, that also applies to (lack of) pace :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: he might opt for a @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Nathalie fell asleep|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's past midnight in Monaco|pg||
nt|penseur9: right and I beleive one more round to play afterwards|pg||
nt|andyv:  low @s |pg||
nt|baldjean: gives the possibiliti of showing certain other hand types, like 575 in minors. you can even show whether  you have 2-1 or 03 in majors and which one is the short suit. important if ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: you open 1nt with a 5 card major too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ybob: with 2/2 trump = 100 % make|pg||
nt|hantveit: here, I jused made new coffee :)|pg||
nt|tez: i said for number 3|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe enjoying a little pastis|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha, my first guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: or a coffee|pg||
nt|grebrof: S might just have played the K of @c or no?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: prob @s or @h - never @CA|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5/5 in minors, I meant|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|vbman: easy battle|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: and they are surely right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol  it took him 8½ minutes to find the only lead that gives the contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: naither 5 minutes now Roland? :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: another*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is still scope for declarer to go wrong of course|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: you both are LOL|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have four more boards to investigate the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who would lead a trump from Qx?|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@d merely helped declarer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: agree Paul:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this hand I would be wary of overcalling 1@s with no length in clubs and not great values|pg||
nt|othered1: A case and it would  have worked here.  But very  risky|pg||
mc|10|nt|othered1: especially with only 4@C|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|chmitty: surtout quand on a des beaux @h|pg||

nt|penseur9: not a good night for the Angelini team to date|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think it was very likely anyone was throwing the @CK, so he might have claimed, saved a bit of time|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Rødovre went to 6@c on board 2 and got a deserved 12imp lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: were back after technical difficulties. bidding on last bord was sumary|pg||
nt|vbman: ============5===========|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would need start with finesse in @C|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: W is a very experienced player. He has represented Denmark in various national championships|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, good result for EW|pg||
nt|hantveit: as we mentioned on board 2, they did chose to play 4S, so imps back on that board|pg||
nt|thorvald: I agree, but as Knut Blakset says, never lead from a Jack, and on a possible 4-3 fit, looking at 3 small @Hs that looks bad to lead a heart, so forcing might be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there must be hundreds of different methods that have been invented|pg||
nt|sybarra: same meant 3 @H for wk 5/5 majors, 3 @S strong etc |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: minor slam here for NS|pg||
nt|famus: yes i think if W vs Red--then surely|pg||
nt|othered1: Even if south can infer @S shortness in north|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  2 pushes as for now and 2 more boards look like pushes|pg||
nt|paulg:  i also have two suggestions for nightmare, so 1@s denies four spades|pg||
nt|hantveit: the open room startet at  board 11, but they have now reached board 1|pg||
nt|grebrof: welcome back|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kjadams: Very good slam on these cards, found int he closed room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  interesting matter od course in a close match|pg||
nt|hedyg: then1@s= no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S can make despite the awful break in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can ruff 3 cards even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry wrong assessment.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: a very light 1N overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: when NS themselves are close to making 3N|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew in some trouble now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  dbl = points (penalty), pass = points as well (ready to play 1nt dbld)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S has a nice t/o x of 1@d, doubling 1nt is more iffy.|pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 1@D in S - also when 1NT is 11-14|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have a 9 off the top 3N here, and the vulnerability should keep NS from causing too much disruption|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Elle avait caché un As !!!|pg||
nt|hantveit: they lead a club at the other table, but Stabile must have picked wrong card in trick 11 and 1 imp out|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow 14 IMPs for Angelini team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fit showing jump?|pg||
nt|penseur9: can he mange the @Hs Roland?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think there's anything to manage ... he just keeps ruffing back to his hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: S may get into trouble here.|pg||
nt|vbman: and his defence was ell|pg||
nt|baldjean: the important thing is we can still show a major fit if responder is 3-0 in majors and opener has a 5 card major|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier when stiff Q of @D falls |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@h by South immediately a possibility (as a splinter raise)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: works quite well here, as North would get very interested with all those controls |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems n/s may be making decisions at the 5 and 6 level here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but after 3@h it's almost impossible to find 4@s if that's the place to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: would you reopen?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will North double....|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  3@d now, good raise?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have doubled 1@d with the S hand|pg||
nt|penseur9: ha OK :)|pg||
nt|ybob: now 4@H by S ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you are allowed to correct 2@C to 2@d, that's ok....but re-opening has obvious risks|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: will Bornholm get to slam on this board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsa: EW convention card state that they play "natural"|pg||
nt|vbman: well thought|pg||
nt|sybarra: did E really bid @D?  zia cue bid?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: but well places @s's & 5th @c & fav vul ...looks all fo\ine foer it|pg||
nt|psyck: *fine time for it...|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, and I would have opened a weak 2@h too|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have support for any suit my pd bids|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes that too LOL|pg||
nt|athene: double 2@C is an alternative for north|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3imps for One Eyed on the first board Open Room going one off in 7@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Devilish distributions here today|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D bid looks a little lazy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1N means points and no @h interest (i suppose)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AJ73 in @S correct to play Nt, but not so nice with Qx in @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@D would be more safe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and we have now changed operator -- I will try to do my best |pg||
nt|vbman: 1nt 'n my opinion shows a high level of self esteem|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1@S = 0-11 without 4 cards @S|pg||
nt|ady: 6th diamond becomes good after 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he doesn't even need a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he thinks that should promise four spades for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and passing has obvious risks, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: that is interesting now|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is (super) gazzilli for F-N?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 4@C bid may have staved off 3nt by s.|pg||
nt|ybob: lost slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  agree. 2@d would have been better for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: bidding was in fact not like that|pg||
nt|hantveit: as we expected ns found the game |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like bidding @H's some where along the line |pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends how many diamonds a 1@d opening shows|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  but will W pass?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, he did|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 with @c or 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: but also unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay, 2@H= @H+@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  fantoni-nunes play more 8- and 9-card major fits in 3NT than any other expert pairs I've seen|pg||
nt|sybarra: by south |pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: the pass asked for the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: Twisted Swine type runouts after NT doubled maybe|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 times trumph, but what if south covers the second trumph?|pg||
nt|paulg:  less advisable here of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Fantoni has shown minimum for his 1@H opening 5@H 4@s and refused the invite by Nunes|pg||
nt|penseur9: this one will play better... time for coffee|pg||
nt|ady: trying a@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The one thing he better not do is draw two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes will "know" @HA is not cashing ... no Blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: why lead an ace then   could have been club void?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 5@H and 4@c of course! sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see, no way to game now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he had to lead something.  And neither of the singletons is at all attractive|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like one down with this lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but defence has to cash its tricks now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks fairly easy for the defence to let 4@s make|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator rates the n hand as 12.60 points:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=a108+1062+kqj754+4|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-lead kill the entry to @S-suit, but duck a @S - play for @Ss 3-3 and @hs 2-2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vbman: which is proven by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: when they do not cover ....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  with @c return, declarer will have his work easier|pg||
nt|othered1: south likely infers that the lack of a negative double (or replacement for it) gives north some @S length.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: NT Runouts: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c could have been @c & @d here if they play that style|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe just play dia now, and give away that ruff|pg||
nt|mathat: if duk the @d meda 4|pg||
nt|athene: this won't play well; if the defence can get a force on west, he can say goodbye to his club suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: 3NT looks a lot better than 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: 7-2 hands rarely play well in the short suit unless partner has five-card support|pg||
nt|athene: 7-4 hands|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: It's an  old fashioned 2@d bid, but not in the last 4-5 decades.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it happens, NS can make a diamond partial |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i think that with a passed hand you can always correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but im not sure i want to correct to my xxxxx of @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tez: 4th  seat 2@h..intermediate i think|pg||
nt|kjadams: This double looks like zimmermann felt the vulnerable game bid created a forcing pass.|pg||
nt|pelu: or help in @D from NS|pg||
nt|thorvald: Its a difficult position in the bidding for north, but im not sure i would have passed that hand the entire bidding|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is not an obligation to play in a suit contract just because you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he might have drawn the conclusion that the @CA was more likely to cash, otherwise, East might have fished around for a grand slam or maybe used Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes.. forcing n-s to play the @D for him as cards lie:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: any thoughts about bidding 4 @C with N hand as opposed to X?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|athene: because if you are 7-4, you are short in the other two suits and you get forced|pg||
nt|pelu: Niels K know that S is in the range for 1NT - so S i favorit to 5-4 in minor|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  seems better for defence now|pg||
nt|runnerup: west was active this time -ew has only 19 points and he was willing to double ns on 2-levelcan be costly |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: @HK good shift, now it's easy to follow it up with the small heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - certainly not obvious to re-open|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gluckenval: all in trsf for them, 1@C -> 1@D/@H = 4@H/@S, so 1@S = no 4M|pg||
nt|hantveit: going down now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hantveit: 2 club losers and 2H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: this can be a little swing -because ew can make 9 tricks in @s -with good guesses -which looks normal declareplay|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Short an entry to make use of the @ds.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Rashed, do you have link to web site for the running scores?|pg||
nt|athene: oh dear!|pg||
nt|athene: did he really do that?|pg||
nt|athene: this whole hand is a battle between west's trump length and north's|pg||
nt|athene: giving him that one extra trump gives him the club suit back|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by Søren-Peter Nielsen|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: I suppose it is quite normal for NS to get to this game , with or w/o interferance|pg||

nt|athene: when you are defending against this sort of contract, where declarer is in a 4-4 fit with a really long side-suit, all you care about is making sure he can't ever draw trumps and ...|pg||
nt|athene: keep control to cash the suit|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you do that it turns out he can change plans and crossruff but that is too bad, killing the side-suit is the first priority|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|kjadams: a good style is to play that if your 4S bid was bid voluntarily, that pass is forcing, but that if it was bid over a preempt, that pass is not forcing.|pg||

nt|hantveit: or let the dia run to the ace and play another dia... |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like NS should stop in 3@s here, but often someone bids one more|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C or 1@D from E?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Small plusses in both rooms add up to 4 imps for Zimmerman.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: takes you past 3NT if that is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: silly if pd has Ax in @H and 3N is the spot|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X by N but prefer 4@H from S|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi, Ed and all!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ybob: good 4@S here|pg||
nt|kjadams: others think that if NV opponents ever bid over your vul game that you have to double, but here you see the result.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N should not have thrown his @h. Then R would have to guess whether S had @SA bare and a heart or two spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes you are all right |pg||
nt|baldjean: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: another slam N/S will they get there?|pg||
nt|baldjean: this time they will|pg||
nt|grebrof: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i guess the 2@d opener is multi 2@d, showing a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d was multi showing a weak hand with a long major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = 10-13 with diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: Maybe Operator should change E's name to Zia :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: board 4 was more difficolut for Multon in other Room.... the overbid was 1@D (not dbl) and the final dbl was from South....|pg||
nt|paulg:  in this case both sides might|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @D = both majors (mostly @H )  they dont play that F ... word convention , do they?|pg||
nt|pelu: Dorthe Schaltz in N proib askinking for the bidding - looking at a solid @S-suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hei vennnen!|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am set to amuse you with useless commentaries here today as well|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Espen|pg||
nt|othered1: decent game for NS hweee|pg||
nt|othered1: here|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is a fine save here over EW's @H game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Paul :(|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  makes as they lay    fortunate contract|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi Joe|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gluckenval: 1D = 4+/4+ same rank|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after strong club opening, NS may use their methods to pre-empt|pg||
nt|runnerup: well you cant do this in every board -otherwise youll have heart attact very soon-down 1 by uppercup|pg||
nt|paulg:  i did presume that West might show some support!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  at least they have ones|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyway, a big lead now for Zimmermann after only 5 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least we agree!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: *east|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Oh wait that would give west a trick on the J|pg||
nt|baldjean: if 5@c is not invitational then S should not bid it|pg||
nt|othered1: and here, too, 5@D has play EW|pg||
nt|othered1: would you act again with west hand?  I might|pg||
nt|famus: he hasnt passe yet|pg||
nt|famus: passed*|pg||
nt|othered1: Against standard auction, especially.  Against limited opening system, where north could have quite a bit of strength, I'd defer.|pg||
nt|xenya: red vs green -- i don't know|pg||
nt|famus: yes that wud b  a consideration going thr Wets's head|pg||
nt|xenya: depends on the state of my stomach|pg||
nt|othered1: Problem is, as opposed to other  hand, east could have some @H length and strength|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz2:  I wonder what the x was, majors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 imps per hand in average|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: north might opt for notrumps over spades with that hand, even with the 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see that these two teams are tied for second|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think the vul is a little bit wrong for W to gamble, and if so I dbl would be looking for a @s fit - which R might had shown with some dbl or so - W did enter VUL vs nonvul, so ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: should have an opening hang at least - therefore I think dbl now from W is wrong - E doesnt have @s  - and its not sure E has anything useful|pg||
nt|gsper:  I guess that 2@D could have been weak, so that 3@H shows 4-card support|pg||
nt|othered1: Let's see, The Law says there are 20 unadjusted total tricks here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like, but what about points?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double by West is pass or correct|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C strong but west whit 4 points could lead to problems|pg||
nt|vbman: dint understand why s not open 1sp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anyone know why South opened 1@C instead 1@S ?|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe he meant to open weak nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: NS do play a "natural" system|pg||
mb|3N|an|short !d|nt|runnerup: some east migth open here -althougth east has a 3-suiter not suitable fos muidenberg |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 3nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: its Ekren (here) not ((Flanery))|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d both major and 0-7?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S looks like a winner - but 4x@c will defeat - impossible lead from East|pg||
nt|dkkello:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Flannery2Diamonds.html  , if you are bored|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptrick in 3NT - not so bad - EW can make a @h partscore|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yeah , what to bid instead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: im sure they dont have an agreement on that :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That 4@C bid may make east bid one more.  No, he didn't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think I might have tried to bid my clubs|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with West hand?pass?2@h 3@h?|pg||
nt|grebrof: look at Ws hand! this is not good bridge|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psyck: hmm, operator updated 4@s to -1|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe Zia did not cover 3rd @d or something|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was: pass if your suit is @H , else bid your suit|pg||
nt|hantveit: on board 3 we can expect imps to ns again, as it seems that ew played away 3h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1003.html|pg||
nt|grebrof: its rarely I am very critical, but...|pg||
nt|xenya: additional advantage is that it might induce NS to sacrifice|pg||
nt|othered1: On the  other hand,  taking out takeout doubles isn't a bad strategy|pg||
nt|grebrof: they say 5@d makes, but that has nothing to do with the fact that Ws hand is too bad (in my opinion) to do anything more|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: they really likes to bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Again e has done a lot of bidding on 2 hcp.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makeable with @c lead and guessing @h right|pg||
nt|penseur9: their are no on line results available on line unfortunatly|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Extremely weak nt non-vul.|pg||
nt|baldjean: and if it is, why does N not go to 6?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup: perhaps Nunes had his moment for 2 @d -now more difficult |pg||
nt|ybob: 2Nt scrambling ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead is good thou|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  natural one down now|pg||
nt|kjadams: aggressive 2N will pay off here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Optomistic bid by n.|pg||
nt|grebrof: Sonne at the other room preferred bidding the more preemptive 3@h, whicch drove NS to game |pg||
nt|hantveit: trumph lead is the best here I think?|pg||
nt|andyv:  trump lead may work best here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: this seems to be a couple down after @d finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass if i had no other bidding cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Tez, welcome|pg||
nt|athene: well, either game makes|pg||
nt|hantveit: good lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: still shoul make|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nice prediction|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, W will have to work almost entirely out of his own hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6S, 1H, 1 and one spade ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: how to make_|pg||
nt|andyv:  he will be luck as this will make...he will win @s and play A@h and ruff @h...the K@h falls, so only 1@h loser and 2 @d losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agreed andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but will Krefeld find this?|pg||
nt|andyv:  however much easier to see that from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, that seems to be a plan, but is it the best plan?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may look at possible finesseing the @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: First  board in this session not declared by E|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, I think it's an easy plan...no preperaton required|pg||
nt|grebrof: since trumps cant be 2-2, you need Hx or HHx in @hs or the @c cut or the @d-guess right - I think here it doesnt matter as the H in @hs comes down on the ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: club finesse is working if club K onside or if JT in clubs together with 2 spades, and then guess d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: You can test @hs first right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Finesse of @c left for last when all other plays have been exhausted|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: @s A @h to A and @h now you know what to do|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, it might be S who has the Hx/HHx in @hs, so why not|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: W should know that the @ds are no good|pg||
nt|andyv:  W must be be contemplating lunch orders|pg||
nt|hantveit: south to hold Kq in hearts are 24%|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: not with an overcall in N|pg||
nt|hantveit: the hearts to be 6-2 and Hx on one hand is much much less|pg||
nt|thorvald: Jens Ove Henneberg making the same error on B3, never supporting partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  E-w gained 3 imps on bd four to shoot into the lead!|pg||
nt|runnerup: but like you see -no mistakes -very good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i thought it would go 1@h (1@s) 3@h (3@s) all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D has a chance now|pg||
nt|grebrof: W wants a shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: @c 8 is for sure discouraging|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: in EW methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart please....|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot , E-W need @H now |pg||
nt|grebrof: @h has to be the better|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i think E is working out which H to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with likely 3 minor suit losers  needs spade finesse   and luck with hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: wrong|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ns 2@s is borderline in my opinion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  will West underlead his clubs to get a spade ruff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|hedyg: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is dummy, he can see it is his only chance |pg||
nt|vbman: this makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 4 majors can be used 1@C (AK) to bid the @S after giving 4 cards( Kxxxx) having rest 2/2|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just need to guess spades and clubs, and have the @D king in place|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: KING!|pg||
nt|grebrof: I would think my P has worse hand than that|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, maybe it is 6-9 something in their system|pg||
nt|thorvald: No, its fine, then a rebid of 2@S can show 9-11|pg||
nt|gsper:  4@S looks one down, even with the double @D finesse|pg||
nt|gsper:  Insurance in 5@H makes sense playing IMPs|pg||
nt|othered1: I thought east, with the good 2-suit fit, might have been the one to topple over (as cards lie)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|hantveit: 16,5|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @s back and you are not going to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: so I think club to finesse first, and h to finesse later|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im too young for that - I agree, but not when nonvul :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|baldjean: yep|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hantveit: not finish in closed yet|pg||
nt|hantveit: should we stall this table a bit maybe?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Good shift should prevent  the overtrick.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means 5@S with Kxxxx not so strong suit, so can bid like a 4 cards suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand why not ruff a @h immediately|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, that 6@C was too much for my pc :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in B1 Haderslev bid the @H-slam where decl need 4 @C-tricks on A - KQ10x - only make is Jxx in @C with 8 out|pg||
nt|famus: well he put out his neck for 3 IMPS mayb:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: This is turning into a rout.|pg||
nt|kjadams: In theory, that finesse not safe, but declarer's assumption that they can't cash 3 spades here is right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: If east started with A63 of spades, this would now go down.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni will be considering three hearts to pitch his club|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: 28 IMP swing, that's all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but how to declare the @S suit ?  Take A first a clear cut?|pg||
nt|vbman: spades are the kings of bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz2:  Now is not the time to get busy on defense.  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they all are accustomed to struggle till the last trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are lucky to see one more @c and @hJ by S - not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so he paused|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Well, he needs the @Sqj doubleton, he knows the @D distribution, what does that say about the rounded suits?|pg||
nt|mathat: @c disc|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes disc|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2 imps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hantveit: its better odds that south has KQ in h :)|pg||
nt|famus: and screwed it up further:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mathat: cut the communication|pg||
nt|paulg:  a scissors coup|pg||
nt|grebrof: and now he gave them 12 ack|pg||
nt|grebrof: back|pg||
nt|famus: wow|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the CR Angelini in E didnt open and EW gave declarer a bit of help in his 3@d contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  S can shift to @d and, after 2 rounds of @ds, a @s will set this|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: -1?|pg||
nt|thorvald: Ups|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning play is to play @C back after @CK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|thorvald: Its not about age :-) You can play the Weak Jump Shift as purely preemptive, og letting it be a little stronger and make it easier to bid invitationla hands|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mathat: thinking  the dpl finesse @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, next board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes.. u they can take 8 trick otherwise which would leave u with 5 and u have 6 from top in aces with the AKQJ in @s aswell|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the heavy favorittes from Odense in deep trouble in this match..|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok this is beyond me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gluckenval: overtricks are coming.... south will have some problem|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Nicely played, with the endplay possibility|pg||
nt|thorvald: no, it was ok until he played a @h, just take the @d finess first|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  oh, yes - last train - finding @s QJ onside|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, for that matter, a singleton @s honor in n.  So it wasn't as simple as I first thought.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: Claim time.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h made other room so leaders chanced|pg||
nt|pelu: then u can set up 3 discards for the @h-losers|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|santyclz: W needed to lead a @s there.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer was worried that west was out of clubs|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
nt|paulg:  my partner prefers that when we bid game on our own that I claim after the opps take the first four tricks|pg||
nt|hantveit: the club duch was not right here. Strange, did not north put the club J first time?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||

nt|paulg:  i can understand not opening, with side 4-card major and a void, and as Fantoni has shown declarer did not need much help|pg||
nt|hedyg: want to swap?|pg||
nt|paulg:  have you seen my bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..no|pg||
nt|paulg:  another challenge for EW|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm, west did throw the @DK under the ace?|pg||
nt|athene: was that really down one?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  both teams started very well in their first matches|pg||
nt|pelu: Åkirkeby is from t|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 3NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  actually |pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@S would go down aswell since a 4'th @C would five east a @s trick.. so should now be bad at all|pg||
nt|baldjean: eat, not east*|pg||
nt|vbman: ------------------------7---------------------------------|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: "That was a nasty opening you had there" said W to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: I just miscounted my @s was the answar from S|pg||
nt|vbman: yes usual excuses \ @@ |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: weird play by south|pg||
nt|hantveit: the oder line is ofcourse heart to ace, heart ruff, dia, and if that is not working, club finess with a hope that hearts are blocked|pg||
nt|hantveit: very strange by south, if partner have one club, he would lead it|pg||
nt|thorvald: On table 4 Århus doubled the lead to 2-0|pg||
nt|pelu: here 4@hs is on|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see on the previous board, after a 1@D opening, East overcalled 1@H on his AK43 suit  |pg||
nt|baldjean: nice slam here|pg||
nt|baldjean: My, do we have goulash hands today!|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm in favor  of their moving right along.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S not bid in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually cold grand slam now|pg||
nt|ady: with the spade diamond 2 suiter|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, sry, @s shift wasn't required.|pg||
nt|pelu: Andread: East would never lead @C - so 3@S is a make|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wstuart: Easy 4@H game here|pg||
nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: playing 3 rounds of @c on lead sure helped|pg||
nt|famus: no legit reason for him to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not open 2s in south. Too strong hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S from the small isle called Bornholm |pg||
nt|pelu: Bornholm - a small island in the Ostsee - |pg||
nt|vbman: strong but nonforcing l think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is long time i don't see a 2@S strong open|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and here something unusual these days -- a strong 2@s opening|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner leads a trumph, the only thing you know for sure, is that he holds no singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Krøjgaard will get there|pg||
nt|baldjean: I will take a short lunch break and will be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5 they sold out to 5 @D x at the other table |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let's follow their methods. Bill will explain|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2NT GF with 4+ spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @H even |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N cannot stay out here|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is likely here, and likely down.|pg||
nt|gsper:  If NS play in @S they may run into a nasty crossruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
nt|hantveit: partner dos not need much before 4s is on|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @s after taking the @c was the right move, however east deserves a prize for his imaginative defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2@S is strong, but not GF|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming north has treated his 3 honor trick with support hand as a game force|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  west forced to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks pal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Happy to be of service|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how we would cope without you|pg||
nt|othered1: JUst maybe he thought partner wouldn't sit with a suit that stron (relatively) and long|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  is that a weak two or a constructive two bid? Looks far too good for a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a vulnerable 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: this double might warn them off the doomed 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: not so much reason to double here|pg||
nt|athene: first of all, you are on lead against notrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Is this lead enough to make the contract?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  nice smoked heerings over there :) |pg||
pc|h8|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When we explain our version of Fantunes to our opps, we generally say: "our system is more natural than yours"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice bid by East - takes up a fair bit of room|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vbman: dont disturb opps if u have them where u can handle them|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@s minimum|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like -1 without a defensive failure|pg||
nt|othered1: or a near miraculous @D guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S or pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems like a book vulnerable weak 2 to me.  The 6/4 adds to the value but still...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But now the difficult part, cuebids, Turbo, whatever|pg||
nt|ady: so far seems very natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agressive invit by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: was just typing,  "may just blast into it"  (6 @S and he did) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: brushed aside with some aplomb, however|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 7@C only going for 1100 unless they find the @h ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: good thing trump ace is out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H here has 2 spades and a club to lose.   Needs kx of hearts onside.|pg||
nt|athene: secondly, most people play smolen and suchlike so even if NS end in a major, you will be on lead|pg||
nt|athene: the only time it's right to get your partner to lead a diamond is when the opponents are going to end up in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: of course the problem here is that the double got them into clubs when they would have played 3nt :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator agrees with you.  12.55 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ak10972+42+7+10652|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c probably a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s seems to be forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: they had a very strong start and a win 18-12 against the defending champions from Odense|pg||
nt|dkkello:  They are not very famous for their bridgeskiles , (until now?)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so North's hearts need only be four long  |pg||
nt|baldjean: missing game here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards very unfrienly here -so many down ,but normal try|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  click on the board you wish to review, and click âNextâ to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  âOther Tableâ, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As you predicted...|pg||
nt|mathat: dbl promises @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: punishing his pd for overcalling?|pg||
nt|paulg:  east seems to have the same understanding of double to me|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C gives up any chance of a plus score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H is -1 and so is 5@C for NS, their best spot.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = american stayman, 2@H = 5 card suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can play seeing all cards after this auction|pg||
nt|thorvald: He had Q953 and A8 in @h, and played a @h to the ace, West dropping the Jack, now take the @D finess and play a @h to the 8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is possible that East would have bid 4@h over a simple raise, but this has no real play on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point|pg||
nt|hantveit: this is a fun board|pg||
nt|ritong: it would not come as a total surprise that declarer shows his hand just after the lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: i can hear Tamburelli swearing into his beard all the way here!|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may go for 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: best def = 800|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 rounds of @hs and then @c switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: will he guess clubs?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lack of @c cue is obvious now|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Fulvio could find it.... |pg||
nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: The questionable bid here is 3@d, i suggest 2nt with all those soft cards. Queens and Jacks plays good in NT |pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni take the Q @c and play 3 R @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tomi2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we in Turbo-land now?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, I only explain the natural bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonsoir henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
nt|santyclz: "OBAR BIDS"  Oponents Bid And Raise Balance In Direct Seat"  Invented by the prolific Larry Cohen.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: With this lay out i don't think he's in trouble regardless|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and it will happen now, low heart back|pg||
nt|thorvald: Following the principle of not leading the singleton when looking at the missing ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hantveit: give partner one more spade, and 4S is on. with only 8 points. and partner might have much better cards withouth investigating for 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he REALLY didnt like the lead|pg||
nt|athene: specs are asking about the 1NT - as far as i know, EW play 14-16 |pg||
nt|athene: and west sort of has 14, if you look at it sideways through a martini glass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  16 boards in this segment. Last one segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of those games you don't mind missing, except when it makes  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: on the boarderline of insanity :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right to anticipate @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: i must admit 4@H was unexpected for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pls explain 7@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My guess is this|pg||
nt|ritong: last time fantoni did that, he got ruffed on the lead  perhaps he will make a remark about that displaying the dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 4@C confirmed 5-5 shape, and North's 4@H was as cue bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South cued 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: club|pg||
nt|grebrof: it should go for...|pg||
nt|hantveit: J|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9: 3@D should make but possibly 3@H by E/W might have also|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp to Levini|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North showede even key-cards with 4NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  andreaS*:) and u are right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: DD best play now id @dQ out of hand|pg||
nt|hantveit: finito|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kjadams: down 1 in 5C is not a disaster, but 7 IMP loss for "insurance" is kind of expensive.|pg||
nt|vbman: trumps cant be33 now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mathat: now -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South knew that all the key cards were there, so cued 5@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: apparently: 3@C min, 3@D extras & no short (that u admit), 3@H low single, 3@S middle, and 3nt high is common in Sweden.|pg||
nt|ady: 7NT better    some chances if if South did not have J@C   or if if clubs 5-0 with the present holding|pg||
nt|dkkello:  some work for declarer still|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: sh play @H8 now - only chance is to fint N with @H AJ97|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and he will pay for it :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finesse in @H was more usefull |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: North with @CQ knew where to play|pg||
nt|vbman: what makes a player 1st class is his ability to reconstruct hands \ and to have the courage to go along |pg||
nt|othered1: @DJ should show east's entry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: It doesn't really matter what s guesses here.  Zimmermann did very well to avoid overbidding.|pg||
nt|thorvald: Really nothing that should tell him to not guess the @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  playing @c10, W may indicate for partner, that he has one more trick in this suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thus, E can duck @s lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not now, supposingly|pg||
nt|hantveit: club q, dia A and c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sry, I'm one round behind - 2nd and 4th. Link is http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub6/Turneringer/KampResultat1004.html  |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like -4?|pg||
nt|vbman: this is ok too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to guess the distribution|pg||
nt|vbman: giorgio?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and I assure you -- W has the courage|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: usually|pg||
nt|vbman: how did the loss of italy of bb taken in the country?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|pc|c8|nt|tez: if go down 12 imp|pg||
nt|famus: But as very rightly pointed out by a kibtz that W shud have realised the drop of @HQ as adefinite sig for @sK|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: weøø. playing @h Q and then then smaller one (last board) could never have been a singnal for @s|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|vbman: 3rd place is ok too off course|pg||
nt|andyv:  finis|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: you tell about the lose in the WC in nederland ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gsper:  Trump promotion adding insult to injury|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzsa: nice defense|pg||
nt|hantveit: not that if north could not see spade ace at dummy, it would be wrong to cash dia Ace|pg||
nt|hantveit: note|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h will make 5, should be a 4 imp loss only|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||

nt|ritong: oops|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think west overbid, but EW were under more pressure with Nunes' 3@d call |pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the other room 2@d made it easier, although South may not have been certain of real diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow, only one IMP difference for last board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And 7NT is NOT better from North's perspective, because he doesn't know about @SJ|pg||
nt|penseur9: last of the day here...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or @SQ for that matter ... so he went for the suit play|pg||
nt|pelu: sprry @Hq correct play (forgot the 10 in dummy|pg||
nt|dkkello:  that is an opening hand   ..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i was playing the transnational |pg||
nt|vbman: l mean when they were playing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria have difficult (illness)|pg||
nt|pelu: he almost know Ns distrbution: 3-3-6-2|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi again|pg||
nt|pelu: 3-2-6-2|pg||
nt|ritong: so i think north should have bid 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: at least it protects him if grand is cold but buried:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and these games always make when the opponents bid them|pg||
nt|grebrof: Rømer didnt play the @d K?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: He is for sure tired|pg||
nt|grebrof: so I guess it is a surprise|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The tournament director was called and is looking at the 5@s bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: my 10 week old smells and she is not happy - brb|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe south would have given himself a better chance by playing @H at tricks 2 than exposing his shape with the @C plays|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wstuart: 4@H game is easy here|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@S x or 5@C ?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: bravo Fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told S is also a lady player|pg||
nt|tez: and 2 partscore swing:)|pg||
nt|famus: but in their system --dunno what they play?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Lou, Bill, André, David, Henri and all specs|pg||
nt|grebrof: some would bid 3@s at E and make it harder for NS, but|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|pelu: will we have a fight on 5-level here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: probably :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S would not be my choice, but I understand what he is doing |pg||
nt|grebrof: the hand before last, overtaking the @c Q with the A and leading back the 8, maybe would make it easier for E to find the @h-shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Yes, paying attention to the bidding was rewarded|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H by NS, 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, 150 for ns or a wash... :) very easy to reach 4SX there|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should just bid it with a 5 card suit...anything else is just wasting time|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  if playing Lebonsohl, S will have to bid 2N first and then 3N|pg||
nt|pelu: would u open in E or wait and bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is awkward mesh for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: 2 more matches coming up|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|penseur9: we must thank Frederic Torrin, our great vugraph operator for a job well done...|pg||
nt|ady: 7@C  may have had problems without Queen and jack of spades|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, but it was reasonable to go for a legitimate chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: interesting convention, helps hide declarers cards if getting to 3N i suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1NT or 2@s on Gromow now?|pg||
nt|ritong: confirmed down 2?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4S looks like 11|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm|pg||
nt|vbman: were people ready to accept the possibility that the italian team got eliminated?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and bridge isn't chess - so 2 slams was decisive|pg||
nt|andyv:  this can be awkward bid for N to handle |pg||
mb|1D|nt|hantveit: transfer 1h|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|pelu: S prob now forced to bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  4@h looks good for an imp or two|pg||
nt|dkkello:  10 easy trick |pg||
nt|pelu: haderslev also missed the fine slam in B4|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think it is an easy 4 @H bid after 3 @H dbl pas (board 4)  |pg||
nt|pelu: in B5 Odense also in 4@H, where decl has to play for @Ss 3-3 and @hs 2-2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but i could be wrong affcousre|pg||
nt|dkkello:  offcourse|pg||
nt|baldjean: North suddenly has a big hand with prtner's 1@h opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i dont think S will look for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: There could possibly be a split score here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tomi2: 3NT = solid major? does some kib know?|pg||
nt|stoffers: I'm 2@s|pg||
nt|stoffers: 7hp in partners suit and a doubleton..|pg||
nt|hedyg: weak NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul and Tez :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: people don't have problems :) know the bridge |pg||
nt|vbman: yes but some signs of weakness were shown in the chinese match|pg||
nt|bridge_one: impossible to win always|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  action from E anybody?, dbl?|pg||
nt|vbman: anyway back to our time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think the italian bridge will be OK still for 10 years|pg||
nt|hantveit: asking for s stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: Use of 2N to show a decent raise of some type has become popular among experts.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hantveit: 1819 2-3 S|pg||
nt|hedyg: and thanks to our excellent operator in Monte Carlo, Frederic :)|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong - again :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: This is more understandable|pg||
nt|grebrof: Jacoby/Stenberg after pass is not my choice, but I am not playing here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Some folks were asking:  Does anyone know if there is a website for this tourney?|pg||
nt|psyck: has some work to do here, ruff 2@c or something|pg||
nt|psyck: no website |pg||
nt|Zmud99: there is not for now|pg||
nt|tomi2: kibs confirm|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hidy Henri.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Henri|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi |pg||
nt|ritong: sorry for the initial caps|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S force|pg||
nt|kjadams: battle for overtricks here.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i like South's 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S = no major|pg||
nt|penseur9: we must thank our excellent commentators, Roland, Bill, david and henri also...|pg||
nt|andyv:  it appears that 3@d bid has values for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: maybe 3@d is invitational and 3@s accepts and asks for a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: as of now at least|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not for penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3N is the better contract here i think, but 4@s will get them where they want|pg||
nt|vbman: do l see a making slam missed?|pg||
nt|baldjean: no, but North may|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that should be that|pg||
nt|othered1: But there are lots of alternative uses, too, including the low frequency natural bid.|pg||
nt|xenya: can you make this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: on a squeeze @s @d ?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Mildly aggressive 3NT which does not look too promising|pg||
nt|othered1: EW cards say this is overly pushy, but south has to lead and can easily give up a critical trick and tempo|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps the Stayman will tout him away from @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: corrected to down 3 ok|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:) Ty Hedy:)|pg||
nt|kjadams: can only presume they play 10-12 or so NT.  Do not have their system notes.|pg||
nt|othered1: By the way, would anyone act on south's hand over 1N? I would at matchpoints|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: duck a @C and hope 2@D cash - high xruff after that|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the def leads trumps to prevent that, life could get interesting.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, trump leads best|pg||
nt|stoffers: But, partner had 5-4 and not 5332 so no problem this time|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over 1NT= same strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light NT-non vul.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: the trump lead should tell declarer that @ds aren't lying nicely for him|pg||
nt|thorvald: Pass from North is forcing in many partneships|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Not an easy N hand for that agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|sybarra: a bid of a reach?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 12 tricks, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Good judgement by Larsen to bid on to 4@h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  your appearance should be marked :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: a safe contract as the card lie|pg||
nt|hantveit: gave a trick at the lead so 11 now it seems|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wow, they really overplayed it in the closed room!|pg||
nt|tez: neck n neck now:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: has to time this one right! |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: cards have to be well placed and they are|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed well placed |pg||
nt|sybarra: so much easier for us,  but at the table??? |pg||
nt|ritong: so|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: agree|pg||
nt|ritong: even if everything rolls up|pg||
nt|ritong: he has 3@h, 2@c and 1@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so needs six trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he really avoid a loser in botht the rounded suits?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *both|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if East is going to need South to hold @HK anyway - virtually no chance if North has it |pg||
nt|grebrof: its really only to close your eues here - N has the important 3rd trump too|pg||
nt|baldjean: back from lunch|pg||
nt|ritong: six trump tricks is doable, ruffing 2@ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: but connections are bad, can he manage?|pg||
nt|ritong: he is considering that|pg||
nt|ritong: the transportation in order to ruff 2@s, establish @hs, hook @c and drraw trumps to boot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: double by N showed strength|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw you all like 2@c by W???|pg||
nt|xenya: on the face of it, declarer has 4 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|gsper:  If partner was prepared for it, yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now @H suit will produce 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would say it is an aggressive double of 1NT ... we tend to want a point or two more in the UK|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.  Does anyone know when the next starts?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting dangerously high|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hantveit: 13 tricks in 4S at the other table. Spade J lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have passed the redouble ... it does not show a desire to play in 1@H-XX for me|pg||
nt|penseur9: very hard to predict final score yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Roland you beat me to it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because I am 6 hrs ahead of you|pg||
nt|penseur9: I beleive they will restart tomorrow at 2pm local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill's comments even faster as he is a further 9 hours ahead|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|athene: that lesser-known bidding art: "splinter rebids by a 1nt opener" |pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  EW will gain an imp here - important for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe the @s6 becomes a 2nd stopper.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 top tricks here.  Needs to establish one more, which can be done in clubs with a good guess.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A small @c to  the 9 looks good here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: he must guess that spades are not running.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a pretty good hand for hearts what with the ruffing value|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour madame|pg||
nt|hantveit: club ace is on the wrong hand for ns, and on the right for ew :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stoffers: nice splits here, and 110 or 140 incoming|pg||
nt|ritong: i try to procced more discreetly usually:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A couple of alert specs tell me that 6@C can make on a spade lead also. Complete cross-ruff and score last trump en passant. Well spotted|pg||
nt|ritong: quel plaisir de vous voir:)|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i don't mean double dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tez: we play penalty dbl after rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt make the 2@c bid look any hotter to me|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|hantveit: at board 3, ns took the sacrifice over 4H and lost 9 as their teammates lost out in 3H|pg||
nt|andyv:  as spec points out, 5@d will make but that one is pretty hard to get to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if West's pass over 4@S was forcing - would bet that it was |pg||
nt|baldjean: I don't blame North for looking for slam. I would do so myself|pg||
nt|grebrof: missing the last game, certainly made N more aggressive :S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hard to say why they got so high here - we don't know what 3@C is|pg||
nt|grebrof: cant say I find a way that S encouraged for the slam, but ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly 3@c=what have you got, 4@C=shortage. If so, North should pass 4@H |pg||
nt|othered1: Made in OR with an endplay on north|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: What's the Saturday weather like, Bill? And the lottery numbers please|pg||
nt|santyclz: N couldn't afford to duck the @s for fear of a @h switch.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i head lauria-versace lose 2 slam in last round|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: @s lead = -1|pg||
nt|vbman: ew score card looks healthy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3@c is semi natural|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@c=club values, I'm told|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like it is going one down, which it a little close for comfort|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and -1 makes sometimes...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Paul|pg||
nt|othered1: now an overtrick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: E and W both had 3 @hs and bad distrubution for a D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: I wouldnt do it. If my partner cant do anything, we don't rate to miss a lot.|pg||
nt|othered1: And I don't think it could be stopped.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: sry guys, get some uniformed information "no" but I asked for someone who knows the EW agreements and not his own ones ;)|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 7 of spades is gonna win defence a trick soon..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Played by w, @c lead.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|thorvald: I think both pairs should fell ok with the development at this board|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|wstuart: Here are a couple of sites that people refered for the tourney:|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass= you pick a suit pd, i can take any|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told the next session starts in 5-10 minutes.|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4: east chose to rebid 2H and went down. I think 2H is a reasonable bid, but no luck here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stoffers: No, sry :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: Stabile played spade K when east played low spade from table? very strange|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's pleasant day, about 20C|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: wd nørgaard|pg||
nt|sybarra: he needs the other spade ruff |pg||
nt|mdgraham: In Meckwell methods, West is making a slam try - pass requests double, then pulling=strong|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and pull is extremely incentive|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wstuart: http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/News/News/Monaco-Welcomes-the-International-Bridge-Elite|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps a penalty card?|pg||
nt|hantveit: a little break here now, so closed can speed ut ahead|pg||
nt|santyclz: The closed room seems to have disappeared.|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe, but then it must have been dropped at the table...|pg||
nt|kjadams: the ace play blocks suit.   |pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking allows unblock.|pg||
nt|baldjean: he can't discard a@c AND @s|pg||
nt|xenya: looks loke it, yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz2:  Friendly hand. Declarer could easily lose control if things weren't breaking so well.|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the last deal of this match|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 more matches in this session|pg||
nt|vbman: esp. after 1st board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i havent see - i was playing|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2nt obviously inviting - Ss 3@c probably confirming gameinterest|pg||
nt|othered1: In fact, right here, north has to give up a trick|pg||
nt|xenya: sort of plays by itself|pg||
nt|grebrof: small @h from N?|pg||
nt|othered1: Nothing double-dummy, either, after the overcall.  Just a good reading of the cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: cashing side winners now to prepare xruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: all it takes is a tiny glitch|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The stock market is going down|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: i would bid like NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3@d for me is invit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and 3@s accepts and asks for a stop|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash at board 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i dont think S hand is good enough to force game|pg||
nt|sybarra: what an impossible hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: a depressing result|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 2nt is game forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 3@c is interested in slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: switch Q@h with Q@d, and the slam looks a lot better, though still not making with @s lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: (explanations from the table)|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats very strange considering N is passed hand'|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why is South interested in slam opposite a passed hand? |pg||
nt|othered1: with those trumps, very difficult to criticize north for the lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: I was playing a tour with a friend, so I was away a little while|pg||
nt|grebrof: any scoretable we can link to here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the auction was fine if 3@d was invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: rightaly so, in my opuinion|pg||
nt|grebrof: probably would have made in any way|pg||
nt|othered1: another good 3N and a tolerable 5@D.  Vulnerability may keep EW relatively quiet here.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Don't you have baby daughter to distract you too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: Running score : http://ffbridge.info/competitions/sel8_2011_fichiers/magiccontestfrance.htm|pg||
mb|1C|an|4!s|nt|bridge_one: the bridge isn.t chess - in the transnational play Fantoni -Nunes and Meckstroth- Rodwell - but they don't win ... and also Zia, Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree with Matias - I bid 3red as inv and 3@c as gf in situations like that|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not invite with 8 points an ace and a 5 card suit :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: double here shows exactly 4 spades, NS changed that agreement and changed back :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more imps in play in this board|pg||
nt|vbman: normal stayman will come l think|pg||
nt|baldjean: rightly*|pg||
nt|grebrof: modest bid from E I must say|pg||
mb|1D|an|relay|nt|runnerup: 2 top loosers in @d and north bid that suit -still not lead -can cost 2 imps|pg||
nt|dkkello:  bornholm is leading (the event now) course the aggresive slam bid on board 4|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4-card @s and a nice minor if partner scrambles in 2NT|pg||
nt|baldjean: because of the 2nt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: passing if you think that there are some irregularities is actually much better - the judges will adjust to what the rules say is fair anyway|pg||
nt|othered1: a 20-20 (HCP) hand.  Not unusual for 1N to make in both directions.  "Declarer's advantage"|pg||
mb|1H|an|Forcing |mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  They right-sised it in the other room, didn't get the @d lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Sigh!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Cool 2@s bid|pg||
nt|pelu: very passive by S 5 trumps and good singleton|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 @S i like|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW have gone their jo b, at some risk.|pg||
nt|othered1: done their job,rather|pg||
mb|1S|an|relay|nt|vugraphzsa: dbl was not alerted. looks like a misunderstanding EW|pg||
nt|grebrof: and why is N cuebidding @S when S failed to bid anything else than 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsa: 7th trick given away on the lead (3rd 5th)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  wonder what he think his partner have ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4-4 heart fit will be found by game can't be make|pg||
nt|grebrof: your 5 cardsuit could have been better :D|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: give S the 10 of D i wouldn't either|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s a busy bid|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-17 bal|nt|tomi2: that contract is both, unlucky and wrongsided|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead in the partner's suit is a jolly good idea :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (sided)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: N says he doesn't remember if its 4+ or 5+ @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  even 3@h is too high (3@s losers and 2@h losers)|pg||
nt|hantveit: open is no playing board 6, will they make too? I guess no|pg||
nt|andyv:  along with a @d|pg||
nt|ritong: @dKxxx, ok, but the rest..|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a little offshape, but 1N is the least lie|pg||
nt|vbman: l off course have respect for loosing ' just how this was reacted?|pg||
mb|2C|an|relay|nt|grebrof: well, well|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: because his 5th trump is gold opposite a @c suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let's just say that NS were reaching for the moon a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: (which S is likely to have)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: I once experienced twice in 28 boards that both us and our opps got a 0 - had my P not dbl, we would have won the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3 @h can be down with @s ruff -3 @d -or 3nt -as looks here has no luck / south -maybe by north -@h lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: he needs to open a sidesuit to try the finesse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because happen |pg||
nt|bridge_one: not bad performance|pg||
mb|2S|an|16-17|nt|wstuart: 1NT is reasonable with the west hand.  Either passing or 1NT could win.|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately not the best this particular hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: Those of you who are thinking about 2@C, however, need to rethink;  that would be a clear error.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should have 6 decent cards for 2@c|pg||
nt|ritong: fantoni is praying now|pg||
nt|ritong: he s on lead vs NTs|pg||
nt|jacksond: hearts agreed|pg||
nt|runnerup: but looks that west is only asking-so should know to bid 4 @h|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A lesson here about the value of x'ing artificial bids.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  We've all seen x's on these auctions even by the person who will be on lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the worst thing that may happen - EW will play 6@h from E hand and S, hearing partner didn't double 2 @d bids, will lead NOT diamond|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  sorry, no|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, private.  Does anyone know about the 3/4th place match?|pg||
nt|runnerup: just have to guess if they have agreedeed this till the end -at least some thinking progressing|pg||
nt|ritong: if anything, if i have to bid something else than 3@s, 3NT looks possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this won't make. N/S are short 1 trick|pg||
mb|3C|an|Do you have a doubleton ?|nt|psyck: or 5 very good ones if no other better bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  will N keep silence now?|pg||
mb|3S|an|Doubleton !h|nt|Zmud99: Next Match 12.40 : Vainikonis ( Gawris Kowalski Romanski Olanski ) VS White House ( Bertens Bakkeren Jansma Paulissen )|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3. time and still no x|pg||
nt|grebrof: mini-nt from N might go a few down, bu doesnt matter much|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: now fantoni is sweating|pg||
nt|pelu: he has prob seen his partners overcalls before :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: I agree... is partner psychhing?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i was so close to type that|pg||

nt|hantveit: yes, but you must bid 3H on souths hand. from this bidding we can determine that ns is not using 21|pg||
nt|othered1: Trump capitulation actually cost 1 imp|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|gluckenval: no entries|pg||

nt|vbman: =============10================|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 losers, so that also indicates no game, but 2H might be stronger, but not strong enough for 3H so I would never pass on south|pg||

nt|andyv:  I'm sure there is a study somewhere in the bridge world that would support your position or mine:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@S and 2@C looked ok :-)|pg||
nt|pelu: ok: 1Nt - P - 2@H (to play) and 3@C by N?|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead suggested E had nothing, so tryng to score 4@h tricks must have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: but as our operator said-  its been a long day for the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: The ruling on board 7 was that N/S play 5@sX +1 -1050 and E/W play 5@dX -1|pg||
nt|grebrof: are there ONLY 4men/women teams in this event?|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok, so 13 imps for BK 1936|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 5@D undoubled obv|pg||
nt|grebrof: I mean 4 persons most at every team|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe even a single J and another 2 aces at W will drive them there|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dkkello:  But good with some action .. watching Meckwell and all the other, congrats netherland, this is "normal life"   ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: We have some technical problems - we will resume at board 11 |pg||

mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: 4@S seam ON played by West|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 8  where 6 @D at this table,  they played 3 @D at the other table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice barrage|pg||
nt|baldjean: slam in @d here. @c slam will go down|pg||
nt|grebrof: 7carder is hardly ever a 1level overcall in my mind|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Ah, life in the strong @C lane.  Since south is limited to about 16 HCP, he can sytemically open lighter.|pg||
nt|hantveit: lol, yes... pls send it too us :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  zzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: 3@S aggressive (but i agree with this layout)|pg||
nt|vbman: 3sp  looks ok to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Limited 3N response simplified auction.  Here it didn't hide much information from NS, however.|pg||
nt|othered1: Might be a matter of  minimum standards for overcall.  Opposite one of my vul overcalls, a couple of aces will make partner do something.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dkkello:  Peter might bid on|pg||
nt|vbman: good royals and trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: no quacks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gluckenval: it happens... frequently|pg||
nt|stoffers: Whats the range of 3@h?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, both 3nt and 4@h are down, but heart game looks natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Will N/S win the battle over West on this board?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 3NTX? where only a @C lead could defeat 3@S - N (Haderslecv) in 2@Sx !|pg||
nt|vbman: we play this 3sp show 5431|pg||
nt|vbman: so dia or h single|pg||
nt|mdgraham: old story - off in a slam, opps not even in game|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, declarer still has a lot of problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no entry to the hand for @h finess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 solid loosers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and playing @h from top may help another day, but now it leads to down 2 and one more push|pg||
nt|ritong: and more|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows that east did not underlead @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, chances of a singleton are close to 100%|pg||
nt|ritong: except if east has all the remùaining high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: but he passed first|pg||
nt|ritong: so, nhe bnecessarily has a "neutral" lead elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: hence, @c = singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: now, perhaps it is right to give @c K immediately|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to limit loss to one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: EW play that K asks for count and W therefore lead the Q asking for attitude|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange 3N bid by N|pg||
nt|hantveit: if 21 then the bidding would go 1s-1nt-2h, but if you use the modern biding it might go|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
nt|mdgraham: team-mates unimpressed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you wonder where did I go wrong???  LOL |pg||
nt|othered1: West won't be happy about this hand (unless he gueses @C) until he finds the @S  distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: or until he plays a diamond from hand intending to finesse -- then he is more likely to play N for the @HQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  even this way leads to 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all up to East|pg||
nt|baldjean: now opponents will have to find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|grebrof: holding N out is the issue here, so a @h-cut might be the thing now - personally I would play @cs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wstuart: East's DBL was responsive, showing values and some of the other suits.  |pg||
nt|runnerup: Welland -team has now got 2 swings -that partial -3 @d here and spades in 10 -otherway other room and where you had 12 in @d by good guesses -5 @d +1 -so White house needs some ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: good |pg||
nt|ybob: hard to defeat , only @D now and later if Q@H duck by S|pg||
nt|ritong: since it is REALLY uneasy to give up that early, it takes ages|pg||
nt|dkkello:  how many trick Peter?|pg||
nt|pelu: in CC= 2@S weak - not the hand we havce on screen here :) looks like a contructic 10-13 opening :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: 1s-1n-2d!-2h=support but not max|pg||
nt|othered1: will north duck @S return to give declarer less infomation?  Or did @S pitch do that already?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wstuart: There are some fancy methods here which I bet EW are playing where 2NT byt the t/o DBLer shows exactly 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: This tournament is the longest single weekend tournament in DK|pg||
nt|xenya: all that assuming he gets clubs weong of course|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s, sorry|pg||
nt|grebrof: with a gazillion @ds there cant be any reason to duck this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gsper:  Perfect defense could have kept this to 8 tricks, but I would not have found it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup: defenders has 4 all the time so -i would say difficult to make with only 1 entry to table|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  spade back, as indicated, and push in the board|pg||
nt|dkkello:  are you watching at the "enemy" table ;)|pg||
nt|vbman: west is right to stay away from game with this hand|pg||
nt|baldjean: "I had a gut feeling, partner". "Yeah, and you produced crap"|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|baldjean: no|pg||
nt|grebrof: now N made it easier throwing a @s, but...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: If west gets @C wrong, south will be endplayed into red suits anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, sure - but over a 3major overcall no matter vul or not, your P will bid game|pg||
nt|gsper:  Now they get one more chance|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wstuart: It is a method I believe was created by Eric Kokish.|pg||

pc|c7|nt|othered1: now west has a complete count|pg||

nt|dkkello:  :)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob making 10 tricks - and 7 IMP back to Hornbæk|pg||

mb|1N|an|18-19 (could be 3!s)|nt|stoffers: 3@h an slight overbid with 4333 and 8Hcp if it is supposed to show 9-11|pg||

mb|p|nt|thorvald: Double showing @D and some tolerance for @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: 3@c is 6+ cards and invitational here|pg||

nt|ritong: 1 any is forcing, for them|pg||
nt|runnerup: this it not down yet -althougth-looks very difficult to make|pg||
nt|pelu: same start in OR - In OR 1@S = unballanced hand promise 5 card @c|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4 NT perhaps|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure they will play 4@h|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: they don t|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@h, I meant of course|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: we had translated:)|pg||
nt|ritong: soo..|pg||
nt|grebrof: N passed 1@s - how good is your hand then?|pg||
nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice.  Mine isn't to make light minor suit lead directors.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally don't really like the suit disparity|pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: not that it matters much here, but leading a small dblton in opps suit when you hold QJT98 is very weired for me|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, the @h shift...never mind|pg||
nt|hantveit: sory andy, but I did not follow lasthand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 2 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 1 h|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 5 d|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: thats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E had 8 tricks but not a 9th and compressed it to 7|pg||
nt|hantveit: west needs to ruff at least one spade on this board|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: so, with hearts breaking, and spade AK in front, there should be no issue|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should have plenty of time for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: looks like 10+ tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  if declarer cashes 3@d tricks, 3@s tricks and will discover the situation in @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: he'll see that soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny game|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, if he finds a winning solution, gromov will say " wd me, didn t double"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with the results e-w has in the last 4 boards the match is problebly their'es|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, kello - East sh bid 3NT, but she gave up the slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  In Haderslev you can cross the boarder to germany and buy cheap beers and wine E-W havent done that today|pg||
nt|pelu: 4NT|pg||
nt|vbman: but if they found a suit maybe u corrected them|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, cannot really see how this can go wrong, often 11|pg||
nt|pelu: better 2!X @D and @C from West :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But I am a certified  chicken in these positions|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, its a matter of style, but I guess they played together before|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vbman: sp again|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not make either |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d9|nt|grebrof: the @ds are a bit rusty|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: or not the best lead p -but they are polite -so no such comments|pg||
nt|sybarra: although better shot now |pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz2:  I'm told that 1@h only shows 11+ if 5+@hs and 4 @ss.  |pg||
nt|hobakan: he will think 8 minutes more this trick:)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 5/0 split is a shock|pg||
nt|ritong: but it will probably simplify matters|pg||
pc|h8|nt|calabres: .|pg||
nt|ritong: north is in trouble|pg||
nt|ritong: for starters, @h position is far from clear|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vbman: spoiled the defence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|ritong: since, now that this atrocious break is disclosed, he has to sail any piece of tissu|pg||
nt|hantveit: west was afraid ofcourse of single dia|pg||
nt|baldjean: declarer will at first have regretted not to be inj grand, but after the first roun of @d was relieved|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: against strong NT (as here) I play D = 5minor+4major - and Ew could bid 4@s (down 300)|pg||
nt|hantveit: must finesse spade T now for 11|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: 6@Cs need @Hs 3-3 or play for @Hq onside|pg||
nt|baldjean: round*|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  dammed , this is boring after peter Fredin and Angelini .. no offense|pg||
nt|thorvald: Looks like we will have a new team in the lead of this tournament, as a victory to Århus with 17+ Imp will move them ahead. Aakirkeby still have the possibility to take the lead to ...|pg||
nt|thorvald: then|pg||
mc|8|nt|runnerup: yes and good thing is it is east not west with 7 on @h -5-0 other way -no chance at all perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Next match on vugraph is Århus against Odense BK|pg||

nt|chmitty: donc @d|pg||
nt|ritong: tom n est mencé par rien, en apparence|pg||
nt|chmitty: du coup, Ouest doit ouvrir les @c lui-même|pg||
nt|ritong: donc une entame agressive ne s impose pas|pg||
nt|chmitty: ce qu'il devrait faire, car au vu du doubleton @s du mort, le flanc @s peut difficilement battre|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

nt|chmitty: ?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|chmitty: Pilon risque de dévoiler la situation de toute façon 1/ en réfléchissant à duqer et 2: en rentrant à @s pour l'impasse @h|pg||

nt|vugraphzsa: Why not end the session with a slam board|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: S didn't play the cards and claimed 11 without noticing the spade situation|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a convention more and more player are using|pg||
nt|dkkello:  NS likely to play 4@H or 3NT her - both making|pg||
nt|dkkello:  normally , the best player of them all imo|pg||
nt|pelu: creativ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: swingy? :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes , thx peter|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and mathias|pg||
nt|andyv:  last board|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Matias for an excellent job guiding us thru here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: thank you to all commentators|pg||
nt|andyv:  and thank you Trond for you fine commentary and of course to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: we will be back after a short break (i think) :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not me...of to bed:)|pg||
nt|pelu: in the next match u will hve voice commentating in Open room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big one to finish!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great result in the other room |pg||
nt|ritong: always a problem when there is a void  let s see|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Well bid by the Schaltz couple efter 3@S  4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Perhaps East should have bid more than 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@Sx looks like 1400|pg||
nt|grebrof: takk for meg forresten - det er festlig å se på :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: he should have known East was squeezed if playing the last trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: or he should have played the @h10 to the Q|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi glad you are here, we dont understand how declarer could make 9 trick on board 10  ?|pg||
nt|ritong: take it easy|pg||
nt|dkkello:  really true , operator?|pg||
nt|ritong: the most probable explanation is the operator had a problem of some sort|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok|pg||
nt|dkkello:  otherwise they are doing exellent work|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|gsper:  I don't like that either, but I don't think it would stop me|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzsa: Brave 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 16 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 12|pg||
nt|vbman: 12|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty|pg||
nt|thorvald: 1@S as in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i would not open this hand with 1S i think|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Vest only bid 3 @S in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting auction in the other room |pg||
nt|gsper:  Of course difficult to be quite objective seeing Ns hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 2N minors (i suppose)|pg||
nt|vbman: minors l think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dkkello:  here is a chance for Odensen , but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: there was a late alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: nobody asked about 2n|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: now W asked and answer was unsure, but minors|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5nt is a 11p nid anyway|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s makes things difficult|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dkkello:  will make it 4 @H now|pg||
nt|pelu: Last board - we will be back in 20 min - tx to kibs and to Mathias our operator who had a hard start on this match - wd|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: rebid 2@c or 2@s?|pg||
nt|grebrof: nid=bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: where do you start with the S hand (at the table)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i don t get his line  no matter   next|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will compete to the 5 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H or double |pg||
nt|othered1: This should be a "yawner" but give south @HA instead of KJ and slam would be decent NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: a littel overbid by ns in the other room -so how is it here?|pg||
nt|ritong: 5NT a nice creation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: against double - 5 catd major and no clubs to lead if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: I thought north might make a mixed raise (constr values with 4 trump) by bidding 3@D rather than 2@D.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: It seems that North follow with @S10 on first trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|stoffers: 3@s loosers and nothing more here|pg||
nt|stoffers: Maybe even 2, but will get tapped on that lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS got a chance to avoid the game after this start|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may get a crack at 4@S|pg||
nt|baldjean: squeeze is more elegant :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: then declarer finessed @SJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wstuart: Maybe he evaluated his hand to be too good for 3@D.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d now?|pg||
nt|thorvald: South need to bid now|pg||
nt|ritong: now @d + @hs is disclosed|pg||
nt|othered1: Fortunately, this can stop safely at 5-level|pg||
nt|xenya: so, contrary to a popular wisdom, 1N was made (with overtricks) by the same side in both rooms|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz2:  The auction at the other table got out of hand when e overcalled 2@h and s bid 3@cs.|pg||
nt|pelu: ok - but board 1 - was a very bad slam = +11, and 6@C - better that the 6@H cost 10 - 42 IMPs on 2 slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 now?|pg||
nt|ritong: but too tough, understandably|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: 6@s here will bring them to 7@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't see how South can bid on - North hasn't shown anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Yes because South will pass|pg||
nt|frm: Måske lidt hjælp nu (6 SP)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  If East bids 6@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dkkello:  trouble now , no! :)|pg||
nt|vbman: well  not my choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: not mine either|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with void in @S i agree with 2N|pg||
nt|grebrof: some play this as void - 3@s showing cubids, but not first round control|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dkkello:  very ugly multi in imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Theres a lot of MAN in this match!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: was a chance to get 8+ in but now hmm|pg||
nt|hantveit: dangerous while north failed to support with support|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul is preventing S from bidding...if that is the case, S might have been better off to bid 2@d first and then @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if east tries 6@s, he cimmits himself to 7|pg||
nt|grebrof: if E bids 6@s now, I think its a little too late|pg||
nt|sybarra: bummer |pg||
nt|ritong: commits*|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe North will, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess they stop in 5@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: 5@C??????? pd is 6-9 - try to make a miracle :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just trying to keep NS out, was unlucky with the 4 @cs in north - "knowing" NS had 4@h standing|pg||
nt|fjog: S should raise after p´s 6 club|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ok, 3|pg||
nt|stoffers: might play @c now, thats the safest option|pg||
nt|vbman: maybe that is a point|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, south is very strong, he is in red, but still stronger then partner wold believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: weird lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  the explaination for 3@c does not coincide with the W hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Ty all we will soon be back|pg||
nt|grebrof: great auction at the other table and this was not so bad either - N didnt have to have any entry for @h cut - which might not even be on|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty all |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Technical problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i will just claim when the play is over|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: ty all for watching|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andreasw:  they lost... who figured?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe peter find a way to 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I cant .. seeing all cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: Looks very hard on this lay out|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see: no play for 3NT - both majors bad for declarer|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe more than 1 down?  |pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: If someone can find a way Peter is the one! :)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR: the lead: @S10 from West???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but E-W bidding on B6 will take some explanation during the comparison|pg||
nt|grebrof: agree - dont need much in @ds from P here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: forcing with @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  they must lead low from xx..that has become more popular last 10 years|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: of course|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: 2@D = Multi - (6 card major) but in 3. hand I like Koch Larsen try to distrub opponents|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: now in dd -without @d lead -this makes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: with @s Jx, yes|pg||
nt|ritong: but real double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i dont like it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: partner will never know your strength or dist|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think south should double 3h, or start with 2d|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wstuart: No guess in @C so this is a claimer.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the outcome is evaluated from +750 till -500 - depending on @s guess|pg||
nt|vbman: cant argue with success|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stoffers: @c @c and then @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks you, partner, nice hand|pg||
nt|baldjean: this will give a few needed IMPs to N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: i dont know what E thought bidding 3@s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup: +1 only -if guesses all|pg||
nt|thorvald: But 4@c would have been better|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everuybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: and i wouldnt feel glad passing to any bid from PD sidding N|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: why not play for a crossruff?|pg||
nt|pelu: but even 3@H hard to play|pg||
nt|thorvald: Århus now in the lead with 33, so even after this board there will be enough iimp to gain the lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to overtake @s Q with the A to make @c finess|pg||
nt|ritong: drumroll|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry +2|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Must overtake...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wstuart: Hi Henri.|pg||
nt|pelu: can he escape for -500?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  4@S down 3 on normal defense , says Ewa, she is probaly right!|pg||
nt|pelu: agree Matias - could prob take 8-9 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: it is way over the boarderline of insanity in my opinon|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: having a auction for 5+minor/4Maj i would use that - but without agreement 2N seam the better|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: classical safety move|pg||
nt|ritong: catering with Q10xx anywhere|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, 4-0 in either hand and he will only lose 1 trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @CA and @c from N now - and blood :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now @c mr Gaunø|pg||
nt|vugraphzsa: this board is not going to make E/W rich anyway - so just get out! :)|pg||
nt|othered1: a true "wish trick" at trick 1, probably the most common place for it.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: !§C coprrect - but wrong card :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has four trumps, but a few high cards would be nice as well |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|ritong: players like jansma identify those as soon as the dummy hits the table|pg||
nt|thorvald: Same result - 5 down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  yes, S this set of boards seems to have taken the easy way out|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS was lucky that 5D was not cold|pg||
nt|andyv:  esp. in open room where it went off 3|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: stab coming|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and kind of squeeze with all the clubs running|pg||
nt|ritong: after some trumps|pg||
nt|ritong: dubinin is aware about the problem|pg||
nt|ritong: his task is to convince declarer he holds @s J|pg||

nt|stoffers: 3@h-4!§h?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4 imps with 3 boards to go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: 4@h :) sry|pg||
mb|3C|an|!c+!s|nt|gluckenval: (private question about 2@D :))|pg||
nt|grebrof: some always lead single trump for some reason - I only do it if its very likely my P has length and has dbl the contract (and even then its not always right)|pg||
nt|grebrof: they never pass with 0hp anymore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: Actually it's Oursel who is thinking, but I have to make the biddings by 2 |pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, I knew that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: ;)|pg||
nt|grebrof: even with 5 @ds and a @c less, the pass is automatic|pg||
nt|othered1: Given the extra HCP, would anyone just punt 3N with the west hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: It will be hard to figure out the @C position and play NT rather than @H.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wstuart: Although, NT would be safer at IMPs and score really well at MPs.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT slight upgrade|pg||
nt|hedyg: XX=@c|pg||
nt|ritong: other room i suggested relay now, then 4@c splinter to find a possible perfecto, but it is intricate|pg||
nt|gsper:  Possibly, assuming that the 1NT is French, ie denying 5-card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: "apek" kowalski is closer to a direct BW than anything else|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H likely an artificial slam try in @S, but east with a flat  hand a minimum honor tricks will want no part of it, I expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and unnatural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: STandings after R5/9 : 1) Vainikonis E. 93  1) White House 93  3) Gladysh 84  4) Welland 77  5) Zimmermann 76  6) Vainikonis V  72  7) De Botton 71  8) Ventin 69     Top 4 teams ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: will qualify for next round|pg||
nt|ritong: salut hervé:) merci|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Zmud99: Slt Henri :) Bonjour à tous|pg||
nt|wstuart: I must say, I would have just bid RKC after 2@H.  Even in my partnerships where 2@S is an ask and I can learn what hand type pard has, I don't hink I really care.|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways north should decline|pg||
nt|ritong: trump xx is ugly|pg||
nt|othered1: seems like I'm wrong again, unless east had a "serious 3N" available to show real slam interest|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  with this help, EW may be pushed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  5@d would seem to always make so n-s shouldn't compete too fiercly.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 600 in @d -lucky sits -and there was also 500 -now 800 in @c to take|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: decent auction  - E rates to have 5 @hs|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|stoffers: Now nunes showed 3@s was an 'advanced cuebid'|pg||
pc|sA|nt|imp_jan: hi folks|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi Jan|pg||
nt|ritong: just for the record, my system allows to discover about @c queen, but i think i would not consider it|pg||
nt|othered1: this likely will give a bunch of imps back to Crestey|pg||
nt|othered1: to Pacault, rather|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: hey jan:)|pg||
nt|stoffers: In my opinion i would have bid 4@h instead of 4@d, as the 4@d bid is 'stronger' |pg||
nt|ritong: dupuis trusts his part|pg||
nt|ritong: perhazps a @s singleton is possible in their methods|pg||
pc|s2|nt|imp_jan: great 6@h here, bid already by bakkeren-bertens in the OR|pg||
nt|imp_jan: KoRo on thr way|pg||
nt|wstuart: Not a hard slam to bid, with any methods.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, 4 boards to go - finger check.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: if you find about @c Q, is 6NT  style points|pg||
nt|imp_jan: just stop under seven|pg||
nt|gsper:  Kib says 1NT can have 5-card major nowadays|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wstuart: They have the potential for disaster now.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wstuart: *whew*|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|imp_jan: btw, what we see here is the Dutch NON open team|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3 out of 4 players were in the selection of Team Orange but not make the Veldhoven Bermuda Bowl Dutch team|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with S hand, may well imagine partner's hand enough for slam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wstuart: This is the point at which the mediator out to have a claim button for teh players.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder how the proponents of including a 5-card major have fared with it, even conceding it may clear up some other hands.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|imp_jan: NEXT|pg||

nt|ritong: lucky sit, i d say  @h K on seems to be enough|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|imp_jan: people ask me how the dutch team looks like|pg||
nt|runnerup: where was the axe now -in first boads they doubled more|pg||
nt|grebrof: 16+14 and no +5 carder is normally not a slamhand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: orange:)|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sort of like... guys sitting at a card table?|pg||
nt|wollies: hi |pg||

nt|imp_jan: missed in the OR|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@H by *west* is very good.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their 1N is to plug various system gaps, nothing to emulate without the benefits of the rest of their system|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah, they use 3@c as ask fir 4-5|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: perhaps W got carried away with his 15 hcp|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: they might get to it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 6 n|pg||
nt|wstuart: by east is pretty decent|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now 4 and 3...|pg||
mb|2H|an|!s|nt|ritong: depends on romanski's decision over 1@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ritong: or the equivalent|pg||
nt|stoffers: he shows interest, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, if NS doesn't go high next door, board  13 is a coffee-board )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  here Fantoni did his best to avoid @s guessing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  experts show themselves in pecularities|pg||
nt|gsper:  And strong 1NT with 5-card M also plugs gaps|pg||
nt|othered1: Like with Blue Team Club -- you don't really want to play 13-17 1N openings, but do it so the rest of the system works smoothly|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|wstuart: How many @H will he bid?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, good chance|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was a poor hand in the context of the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: but then they are 5422 somehow with a 4 card  major|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This will likely propel west into bidding some more.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: to be honest, i wld have bid 4@h as well as east ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 4@H - it should show a good distr hand but not particularly strong in HCP (wihch would have started with 2@S).|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly|pg||
mb|4N|nt|imp_jan: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has everything to try that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4n, whatever that is (RKC?, general slam try?)|pg||
nt|ritong: especially @c KQx|pg||
nt|wstuart: Likely RKC for @H.|pg||
nt|wstuart: East will think his @S void is useful, so will make a response above 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: he has three keys, otoh|pg||
nt|grebrof: flat hand, 3 trumps, Q and J in front of opps suit in 2 suits with a minimum balancing hand - yes - we have a whole book here somewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|wstuart: I don't know what their methods are - typical is 5NT is 2 and 6m is 1.|pg||
nt|othered1: right-siding the NT contract, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: with a void in that suit, but there are many variations which are both reasonable partnership specific.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazing 5@S by north btw|pg||
nt|stoffers: Slam makes here, but hard to bid and quite lucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has some play but ,,|pg||
nt|hedyg: precision 2@c= 10-15 5+@c +4M or 6+@c|pg||
mb|6S|nt|wstuart: This fits with DOPI - Double = 0,  Pass = 1, 5NT = 2, 6@C = 3, which is what he has.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Would they bid the same way if dubinin had QTxx in @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Many pairs choose to play DEPO at 5 of their suit and beyond (D = Even, Pass = Odd)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wd ew, especially by apolinary kowalski|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Kras ... found an amazing lead against 4@S in the other room, small club!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Suppose south lead a low @D - would you play low or put up the @DK as declarer?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Optomistic invite with all those soft values.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|grebrof: if I was to directly translate "Thuilez" into norwegian, it mean that they are kidding around a lot - det tulles mye av Thuillez|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is better from east hand, on auction and EW cards alone|pg||
nt|grebrof: I played 12-17 one season and it worked well - 1minor normally +5card or strong|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|runnerup: if this makes leader chances again|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|grebrof: now 12-16 is the only alllowed range|pg||

nt|vugraphzph: Last board here. Thank you for watching. Next segment in 25 min|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: @s lead, and we have to play some cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no S cannot play 7@s|pg||
nt|runnerup: also 7 @s by south -can they --just kidding|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone think the spade-less 11 count might be handled better with an initial pass?  And not just from a point count, open any 11 perspective?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c relay|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wrong-sided the @ss here, 7@s by s makes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: Last board of the segment 2. We will resume in 30 min. Thank you all|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|gsper:  A lucky stop where game was clearly worth bidding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: jan!:)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: there is only 6 teams in consolation - Team White House and Marill play a 3rd/4th match |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  10 tricks indeed, will be corrected|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  So 1 IMP could indeed be worth 10,000 euro|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Our operator is Nathalie Frey :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Good luck Nathalie|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t want to jinx them, but if fulvio decides to play in @ss because it scores more...|pg||
nt|othered1: And wouldn't it have been nice for east to have a strong jump shift, showing a good suit, available over 2@C?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  assuming, boards 13 and 14 may bring swing, let's wait the outcome|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: jan is also jansma's first name|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d showed @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= @c|pg||
nt|ritong: and dubinin doubles because of his void plus the ace in case of run to Nts..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H= odd nr of keycards ( in @c) incl @H control|pg||
nt|ritong: turbo stuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Henri|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wstuart: Shall we just write JanJan?|pg||
nt|ritong: he did not like @d xxx, pity|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may me a squeenze vs west now|pg||
nt|imp_jan: black suits|pg||
nt|wstuart: Like Henri said, it will be interesting now.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  8 teams in consolation have to play 5 matches x 10 boards, after first one De Botton has 20 VP, Welland - 19 VP, long way to go as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  uh oh|pg||
nt|xenya: i admit i would have opened the W hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: Gromov needs to find the lead still|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Nå er Fan-Nun i 7 sparx |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: And I would not have put down AKQ10652 as a side suit in dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: Doesn't look like east ever really got his excellent @S suit into the auction, unless 4@C really focuses on @S in t heir style.|pg||
nt|gsper:  A spec points out that the trump finesse is into the opening bidder, which makes the game more doubtful|pg||
nt|othered1: without the auction, yes, since you need a finesse and nothiong else bad happening,  but here it depends on the likelihood of north's holding the @HK, which on the opening bid is ...|pg||
nt|othered1: well more than 50 percent . . . |pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: that dhould not be difficult here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: i was talking about 3NT, but works also in 4@h, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3500 specs holding their breaths|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it ok to hesitate so long before  lightner X?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|imp_jan: leading away from a queen for sure gives jansma a clue|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: problems arise when you huddle and pass|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: West had an awful hand to lead from.  QT9x into a strong NT opening wouldn't be anyone's first choice, but look at his other options.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and jansma will realize that|pg||
nt|wstuart: This will give south some information later in the hand when he's trying to guess the ending.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: what a show|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: Nathalie, il a posé des questions?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|imp_jan: this helps declarere the defense in clubs... |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|runnerup: so a very good match -tx all -and by|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  was greatissimo|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  What a match!  Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Congratulations to Team Gladysh !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Thanks all :|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: bye all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: third place is Marill team - 4th White house|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: byeeeeeeeee|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|gsper:  Well, thank you operator for a nice job!|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: Thank you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: See you in 30 min|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wstuart: It's interesting:  would south's K or Q of @C be harder for west to duck?  And  shouldn't west duck the @CA there?|pg||
nt|othered1: Here west's rebid of @D on a mere (though good) 5-bagger got east misdirected.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wstuart: I think west can hold the position if he ducked the @CK but I think he can make now.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no count rectified|pg||
nt|imp_jan: shld have ducked a diamond risking a spade return|pg||
nt|ritong: needs xray spex imo|pg||
pc|cA|nt|imp_jan: here we are|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he found something|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzph: Bye all|pg||
