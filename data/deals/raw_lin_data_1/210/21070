mb|p|nt|jjsb: i i think 1@s 2@h a @c is the most defense can do |pg||

nt|jjsb: or actually maybe 2@c forced 2@d |pg||
nt|jjsb: and 2nt showed the 11 |pg||
nt|jjsb: here the very good things for declarer is that the J of @s is on South's hand |pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jjsb: hand an also favorable @s lay out |pg||
nt|jjsb: note the K87 of @s on south |pg||
nt|jjsb: give N the 7 for exemple its not totally same music|pg||
nt|jjsb: so declarer can make 1h 4@d 3@s (thank to the @s situation ) and not in danger in @d |pg||

pc|h9|pc|dK|pg||
