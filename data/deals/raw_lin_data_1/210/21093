mb|p|nt|jjsb: Indonesia are definitely the big favourite od this competition with there awesome performance in the latest Venice cup ! |pg||
mb|1D|nt|don_kapu: small @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: so this is a match probably for the second seat , still interesting |pg||

nt|fabsayc: asbi knows defense in trouble|pg||
nt|jjsb: on a @c return all is very ok for declarer , on @d its a but more awkward to play |pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably return a diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jjsb: not sure about that play .. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jjsb: even if u win and Q is second i dont see why its helping |pg||

nt|fabsayc: he cross ruffs and eventually discards a club on hearts, still makes 4|pg||
nt|jjsb: u will have to play @h ruff @c ruff @h ruff it set tup but i think u still have to contine with @c ruff and AKof @s and @s |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jjsb: i understand that she felt the singleton @c and thougth N got long @h but still |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jjsb: N will have only @d to play |pg||
nt|jjsb: here as far as i see declarer in complete control with AK of @d dummy |pg||
