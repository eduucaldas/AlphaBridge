mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|A|nt|jjsb: its kinda rare we do play 2nt in "modern" bridge :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jjsb: that is probably the rare hand that u will deny an invite when vulnerable |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jjsb: declarer can make 8 tricks but the problem is that defense make 6 before as i see it |pg||
nt|jjsb: note the 10 of @c lead |pg||
nt|jjsb: not an easy hand to defend |pg||
nt|jjsb: thougth perspective looks better in @d than in @h |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: defense can take first 8 in most lines after diamond lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jjsb: well...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|jjsb: it was not bovious |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|jjsb: just imagine East is with Qxx |pg||

nt|jjsb: that would be just enough |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|jjsb: so now its 4@s 3h and the @d |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jjsb: 3@h |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jjsb: actually i was wrong to say that @d is more promising the 1@d was scary |pg||
nt|jjsb: the defense is just all normal again |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: he cross ruffs and eventually discards a club on hearts, still makes 4|pg||
nt|jjsb: u will have to play @h ruff @c ruff @h ruff it set tup but i think u still have to contine with @c ruff and AKof @s and @s |pg||
pc|c5|nt|jjsb: i understand that she felt the singleton @c and thougth N got long @h but still |pg||
pc|s3|nt|jjsb: N will have only @d to play |pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: funny enough its about the same kind of hand (with @d) compare to East's hand board 12 |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: same looking structure |pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: never saw a 1 level overcall i did not like|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: :) |pg||
