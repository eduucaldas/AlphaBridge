pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|jjsb: i think as the card lie u can manage to make 6 by ruffing whole @s and make the @c finesse |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|jjsb: u dont have all the communication and tempo for it |pg||
nt|josj: no, you would run out of trumps in both hands but 5@D is OK|pg||

nt|jjsb: u sure Jos |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am missing soemthing ?|pg||

mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|jjsb: that is probably the rare hand that u will deny an invite when vulnerable |pg||
pc|s3|nt|jjsb: declarer can make 8 tricks but the problem is that defense make 6 before as i see it |pg||
nt|jjsb: note the 10 of @c lead |pg||

nt|jjsb: decide |pg||

nt|josj: 4@H is an overbid, soft values|pg||
