nt|jjsb: or actually maybe 2@c forced 2@d |pg||
nt|jjsb: and 2nt showed the 11 |pg||
nt|jjsb: here the very good things for declarer is that the J of @s is on South's hand |pg||
nt|jjsb: if not i would think the defense would be in control |pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|nt|jjsb: hand an also favorable @s lay out |pg||
nt|jjsb: note the K87 of @s on south |pg||
nt|jjsb: give N the 7 for exemple its not totally same music|pg||
nt|jjsb: so declarer can make 1h 4@d 3@s (thank to the @s situation ) and not in danger in @d |pg||

pc|c3|pg||
