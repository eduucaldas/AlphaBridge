nt|farfie: après l'horrible quart temps du matin,nos amis ont repris quelques points|pg||

nt|mamos: hello all|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|hlortz: ns missed a chance to get some IMPs back but no one had a clear X of 4@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hallo Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: so,if lasserre wants to show both his suits at once he has to bid 3@c|pg||

nt|ritong: nice morning for your boys|pg||
nt|subhranp:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: so a few imps for some overtricks on Board 1|pg||
nt|mug: sorry it's 1.5 IMPs, so England win the ties|pg||
nt|ritong: boyd has a clearcut 2@c overcall  robinson's reaction is interesting to observe|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1@s: the suit is SO good|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphznx: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Last session of the day now|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 world champions facing the Indonesians|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi :)|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a toy|pg||
nt|grebrof: look like a flat board again, but you never know|pg||
nt|henryb:  and driving to the three level seems like a lot|pg||
nt|subhranp: not sure of the range of 1n for EW, normally 1n should be opened by E|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: "Toys R us"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  Hi Mike, any news on the ruling from the last set? Julian|pg||
nt|mamos: an aggressive t/o double from East |pg||
nt|mamos: as we would expect|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: director called|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: 1@h not alerted |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: W alerted it is txf|pg||
mb|2S|nt|subhranp: this is a good spot for DSM|pg||
mb|d|nt|hlortz: here we had a pretty routine texas to 4@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North sure to come again|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c showed @s & @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this inv migth lead -to 4 @h -2 if they find ! ruff|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS will just see how many of their "winners" will cash|pg||
nt|westjava: good save in 5@D|pg||
nt|mug: correction direct from Aylesbury on that point, Barry's giving them time off to watch the match|pg||
nt|grebrof: mostly for kids, but someone never grow up - guilty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: when playing @hQ Leenhardt played cQ instead of @hj|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: Sally Brock's 2NT shows a good @S raise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with 4+ in @H|pg||
nt|farfie: un solide 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: just overtricks at stake - time to get some tea :)|pg||
nt|mug: Heather might have reopened with a take-out double here|pg||
nt|farfie: 11 levées sur la place du roi de @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: boyd estimates that his shape is more adapted to a suit contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: this looks pretty difficult to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@S losers and can only afford 1 @C loser|pg||
nt|ahalim: can prubaly make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: run the @c 9 after eliminating @s and @d looks best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can maybe eliminate @S and @D |pg||
nt|ahalim: yes that works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room Dhondy led J@C |pg||
nt|grebrof: Q of h!?|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|ritong: he might even finesse @d 9, for the fun|pg||
pc|s3|nt|alnanda: 1S LOSSER DISCRAD WITH q@D|pg||
nt|mug: 2NT was minors, also fairly reasonable but swapping plus for minus|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: at some point in the game|pg||
nt|mamos: several specs ask about the ruling from the last set   does anyone onsite know the outcome|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heather too busy but everyone bids more than me|pg||
nt|mug: lucky not to be bigger minus, both South and North might have got hold of 3@D|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|don_kapu: what a brave bidding|pg||
nt|don_kapu: but 3nt look like will make|pg||
nt|grebrof: whe n your P opens and you have a 6  card mjor suit, I find no defense not bidding them at the 3 level  - esprcialy holding the A|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|mug: Nevena would have left a double in, 2@S is one off|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 or 3 off|pg||
nt|henryb:  This seems to be down 2 |pg||
nt|subhranp:  this should go 3 down|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahalim: but decl might place the @CK with W because of the overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the discard doesnt do much good except aid the elimination|pg||
nt|ritong: really|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mug: but I can imagine Heather feeling that defending doubled partials was not the way to go at the score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT a more attractive spot than 3D - perhaps pass by East was better option|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  system card for EW http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/VeniceCup/England/smith-brock.pdf|pg||
nt|mamos: Club lead will allow trump promotion|pg||
nt|szalay: more likely 3|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h needs a very accurate defense to go down|pg||
nt|subhranp:  but NS have a partial in spades|pg||
nt|subhranp:  hi sriram|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe + 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|alnanda: lead @s big problem for declerer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know i would go down, let's see if Nicola Smith can make it|pg||
nt|alnanda: ohh sorry|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe they use it as GF, but thats to timid I think|pg||
nt|ritong: kindof wild, isn t it?|pg||
nt|grebrof: F1|pg||
nt|grebrof: I am wils|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: fyi Om Prakash is a blind man |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: well 2NT was the minors and East did had four diamonds|pg||

nt|rmb1: Another potential 3NT?  EW may not bid at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W didnt do well actually|pg||
nt|mug: took some defending though, the defenders need to clear their club trick before declarer sets up the long heart|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 8 out of the blue|pg||
nt|ritong: promising hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  And South wins and leads trump|pg||
nt|ritong: and at that point he has to double hook @cs directly, no?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: now a real 0akeable game on 3nt  and will be bidden i presume|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: you can play the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: alas we shall never know|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: means running @c9 afterwards @cQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  An unfriendly hand for N-S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Both black Ks offside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: makeable|pg||

nt|ritong: can t know what they have agreed about 4@h as opposed to 4Nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: why would you do that unless you see all the cards?|pg||

nt|runnerup: slam|pg||

nt|psridhar: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5 ruffs and 2 aces?|pg||
nt|rmb1: The first set will has shown that there will be a battle on every hand in this match, no chance to relax|pg||
nt|mug: E-W are playing strong notrump, 5-card majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: W just didn t open ;)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: both tables playing weak nt - common happening in England but not elsewhere|pg||

pc|sK|nt|szalay: generally better to play from STRONG side|pg||
nt|ritong: seems that 4@h was not void showing|pg||

nt|rkj_0264: h king lead|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good bidding by NS so far|pg||

nt|mug: 12-14 NT rebid and 2@C checkback Stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: flat hand, bad trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: if she doesnt rise will need to guess clubs but I expect Ace|pg||
nt|mug: Dhondy needs to rise ace here, I think she's likely to do that as she's cold if hearts divide|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barbyh: big red cheeks and black hair, thats about it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting the threshold that players set for a 2-level overcall these days|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 3h one dia fr dsm|pg||
pc|c8|nt|runnerup: timing has not been best possible -when game is on you are in partial and wise versus|pg||

nt|mamos: defence have four tricks if they can organise |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: hi all|pg||
nt|mug: even low would have been ok, she'd have been forced into rising king at trick three|pg||
nt|ritong: and not vulnerable to boot|pg||
nt|subhranp:  although clubs not breaking, spades are thankfully 6-2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: 2@c Gazilli has been much in evidence in these championships|pg||
nt|szalay: he must play for @S later or (better) sooner|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: i see -slam not so clear -but makes this time|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with clubs 5-5, the @s trick is not running away|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahalim: the indonesian players were once coaached by Kokish, that's why they play weak NT|pg||
nt|alnanda: @h blocked''|pg||

nt|ahalim: made in the end :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|mug: so noone has anything in the locker, just 13 more board of bridge, we think Arifin?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H from West? |pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@S C turned back to 4@S + 2 |pg||
nt|szalay: btw 2nd trump by South instead of @C wd be stronger defence|pg||
nt|subhranp: arvind should have kept the bidding open with prime controls and 5 carder support rather than shutting out the bidding|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 5d or 3nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: but the program seems to be dishing out balanced hands since beginning|pg||
nt|psridhar: at last a void :)|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this is a big gift to the hosts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: this was black start from n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: commentator please|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes tricky - because if North bids clubs strongly, NS are likely to finish in 5@c rather than 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: in the OR the Indonesians played the first three tricks in the way needed to defeat  -- but then West continued Spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lontoh 63: that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H not exactly classical with four spades on the side, but what do you suggest?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: practice 4@H|pg||
nt|ritong: this kind of hand generates a lot of accidents|pg||
mb|2C|nt|runnerup: here normal handling in 1s lead to 12 tricks in @h (or nt ,but that is wrong contract)|pg||
nt|hlortz: well suit quality of weak 2's has gone down over the years|pg||
nt|wstuart: A common treatment is to play 4@S as a strong single suited hand after a weak 2 opening.|pg||
nt|henryb:  A not unreasonable 3N for N-S, needing mostly the heart finesse, which is offside|pg||
nt|psridhar: i have seen Sumit overcall with less; perhaps his faith is in suit length ; i wd hv chipped in 1@s there|pg||
nt|psridhar: no problem there is his pd with more than sufficient imaginaltion !|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: martel will likely buy it for 4@S -1|pg||
nt|wstuart: That looks likely.|pg||
nt|ritong: it is really good looking, for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: but the obvious danger is to drive too high|pg||
nt|henryb:  X = 3 card heart support|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne idée de Guy Lasserre,ce contre d'entame|pg||
nt|jjsb2: bonjour tout le monde :) |pg||
nt|farfie: bonsoir Sylvain|pg||
mb|2D|nt|runnerup: in @s|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and all pass for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahalim: only half an imp extra for England, which the program cannot show|pg||
nt|jjsb2: c'est docn parti pour une mi temps probablement haletante et pleine de rebondissement ! |pg||
nt|rkj_0264: no chance of swing|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3@C is a goodbad 2N accompaniment-showing good hand with minor 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: an excellent bid of 3NT, some players would double but you don't really want to heart partner bid clubs, let alone diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok for me but I bet that there will be some 4H bidders|pg||
nt|ahalim: ok turned back to 5@S +1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lontoh 63: io so cape maklum lah ....... kondisi begini yang kuat stamina yang bisa main bagus ,tapi sama2 US juga pasti so cape |pg||
nt|ahalim: omg a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not always nice to play in a 3-3 fit |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if EW had bid and raised @d, East might lead the @d2 as suit preference|pg||
nt|ritong: so, as long as pard is not a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: my policy with these is to take low road|pg||
nt|farfie: l'entame "naturelle" à !k donne une surlevée|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: flat board|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM's X shows values not penalty i guess -they are yet to find a fit ..|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: s... thinking|pg||
nt|psridhar: they can nick this for 500 but they may be more ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: declarer should cash @CA at trick two, plain sailing from there|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=SF&qtournid=886|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en passant un grand bravo aux femmes qui ont gagne la competition "venice cup" à 16 donnes de la fin |pg||
nt|jjsb2: bref ... :)|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici lasserre a cotnre 3@h est donc poizat est normalement obeissant |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: partner opened and you had 19 hcp -may lead to slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 6@h they can set up @d with @c entry on @s lead; cant beat it on @c lead also|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: will have to put in the scores manually|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a more straightforward make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice by declarer in the @h suit|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising choice|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps the support double more or less infers long opening suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  rather than 2N?|pg||
nt|ritong: or double|pg||
nt|psridhar: as kibs point out even 7@h is on|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wstuart: Not much to te play on this one I think.|pg||
nt|ahalim: for people who are interested in the score per session of this match|pg||
nt|farfie: bonne nouvelle:5imps tombent dans notre escarcelle |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le cotnrat n''est pas tres claire a joue , les communications sont un peu bizarre |pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphznx: + 2?|pg||
nt|ritong: sticking to hcp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup: @d was missed by ew -but it can happen in many secvenses -|pg||
nt|yo_yo: happens a lot when 1NT forcing and west is forced to rebid longest minor|pg||
nt|mamos: easier for us of course because we know Spade honours onside|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Pak Arifin. is this the official score?|pg||
nt|mug: Smith made the maximum in the CR, so declarer has to pin the @S10 or manage some kind of endplay to flatten the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now should start spades from dummy or Ace and small spade|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps @DK next to guarantee the contract?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes Q of spades works but swop Ace of diamonds and spade king and a bad idea|pg||
nt|ritong: for once:)|pg||
nt|ritong: meaning " i want to stay in, but no clear path"|pg||
nt|psridhar: on @c lead only 6@h |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: don't know how many degree on there but though cold now|pg||
nt|mamos: but looks like making even if declarer loses a trump a Heart and a Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trying to decipher the NS leads - presumably declarer knew the @hQ was offside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|farfie: plus que 8 points à refaire|pg||
nt|farfie: le déclarant n'est pas arrivé...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: en fait j'ai tendance a pense , peut etre a tort, que le coup ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: le meilleur jeu est peut etre pour le declarant de jouer R de T |pg||
nt|jjsb2: mais 1) ke ne trouve pas ca naturel et 2 je ne pense pas que cela suffise |pg||
nt|farfie: oui ça coupe les communications|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que R de T permet de gagner j'ai perso un gros dotue|pg||
nt|jjsb2: si on duque le R notamment |pg||
nt|farfie: certes|pg||
nt|farfie: en tous cas,jolie initiative de Guy Lasserre ce contre|pg||
nt|subhranp: with 4imps seperating the two teams, even OTs would matter here|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|vugraphznx: It's about 20 degrees Celsius in here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sry for the name of the match, I didnt do that|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: OR started twice, that was the problem|pg||
nt|alnanda: np paul.., thanks a lot :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: JM had a problem over 3@s -he has values for game but no fit found yet; i sympathise with his X , he didnt know about those golden @H cards with kista|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: Thx Ruud ....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was ok too|pg||
nt|jjsb2: bien malheureusement Est ne c'est pas mifier |pg||
pc|d8|nt|farfie: Aie!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: how do you like that, stevie?|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: flat board|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: now 10|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: East might have bid 2@D though|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mamos: now presumably a @d and a trump up|pg||
mc|9|nt|runnerup: all boards have been flat so far |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 81-66 is the score|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you have opened arifin?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2 imps missing for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit weak for me to open|pg||
nt|ahalim: with West;s cards ? No|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they seem to lead the 9 from Q-10-9 - zero or two higher leads|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|anton72: I have an question ....is it 0,5 imps enough to reach a final ?|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 3d or 3s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hlortz: possible @S slam here|pg||
nt|psridhar: that will fetch at least 4/5 imps if they stop in game other tbl|pg||

nt|farfie: un horrible coup en arrivance...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici 3@h montre normalement un desir de jouer plus que 3@s 3@s etant purement competitive |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|wstuart: RDBL shows the ace, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|ritong: disciplined 2NT|pg||
nt|grebrof: USA know they are trailing, so pushing might be the only chance|pg||
nt|subhranp: 4s is normal contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he has a 2N scramble 3@c is ok|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: sorry - i am having block- I seemed to have thought that dummy had only 2 hearts on last- ignore everything I said|pg||
nt|westjava: re hi all!|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphznx: rehi|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@C forced 2@d|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|szalay: happily undoubled|pg||
nt|jjsb2: il est peut etre possible d'intervenir a  cette vulnerabilite avec la main d'Est egalement |pg||
nt|farfie: je pence que Philippe Poizat aurait du intervenir à @d dans cette position de vulnérabilité...il doit se reprocher le coup précédent|pg||
nt|farfie: pense|pg||
nt|jjsb2: ici pour le coup comme on peut tous le coir 3@h ne joue pas "tres bien" |pg||
nt|jjsb2: je suis d'accord dominique |pg||
nt|psridhar: d2 perhaps|pg||
nt|psridhar: if bhabesh cant X i doubt sumit can|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Suhas in deep thought|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: Now West opens her 10 count and |pg||
nt|ritong: this @h 7 seems to come from blank suit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|runnerup: 3 @h could have and would have been -2 ,but not a place to pass for west -very difficult place |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I think he will finesse in @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not really|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: S then must have had @hA|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but it would create a 2nd entry to dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: will they reach to 6?|pg||
nt|hlortz: cue bids here...|pg||
nt|psridhar: at least he didnt press on to 3@s which can go minus|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wstuart: 4@C is likely a control bid in that suit, however, it may show a min range in HCP;  they may play a serious 3NT which would show more HCP and then let opener continue the auction.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahalim: evrybody starts bidding :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 11 seems a lot of tricks in OR|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on me dit que l'enchere de 3@h est "douteuse" ... je suis aussi d'accord |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: when it s not a possible fourth best|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it can be a "forced" lead, so Q87 remains possible|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: West will regret opening in a minute|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3@H was likely an ask for further description.|pg||
nt|ahalim: remember the Dutch ladies won the venice cup by 0,5 imp some years ago in bermuda|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|alnanda: for 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maximum 6 down = 1400|pg||
nt|mug: very aggressive upgrade by Heather Dhondy, the five-card suit is good but the stiff A-K not so good|pg||
nt|mug: decent contract but the minors lie badly |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and we have bread under our arm all the time|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|jjsb2: piganeau l'a egalement faite pour info |pg||
nt|rkj_0264: coward bridge|pg||

nt|yo_yo: who will Nicola play for @D?|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe -1...|pg||
nt|wstuart: so likely 5 IMPs back to USA2|pg||
nt|hlortz: k@C shed a @H?|pg||
nt|hlortz: look @@ the interesting @D spots :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|westjava: Tueje finess @CQ at other room|pg||

nt|runnerup: some overbid  -but that happens -even 4 @s is down - also 5 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E deeply in thought|pg||
nt|mamos: The English NS pushed EW uncomfortably high here but 5@S made seems like a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in the OR NS competed to the 5-level at the favourable vul but EW judged successfully to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|anton72: need a minor shift now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahalim: when E shows up with the @S A, Nicola will guess the @D;s I think|pg||
nt|grebrof: you make good bread thou . almost as good as the danish|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blewah: @d return to force a guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: WEst made a vulnerable bid so is maybe favoute to have ace|pg||
nt|psridhar: if either Jm had overcalled 2@c instead of 1N Or kista had bid 3@c instead of X , they wd hv competed to 4@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: in 4 @s defence should be like @h  lead -@s to Ace and @c .to beat it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahalim: worlclass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on shapely deals like this, having more aces is important|pg||
nt|mug: not sure this was good for the defence|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahalim: Ok next board please|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes WD nicola|pg||
nt|blewah: well done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR  Dhondy led A@D  so no guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nicola will claim when the next lead isnt ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: with @h K on he will lose three trumps and basta|pg||
nt|ritong: at most|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1s 3h 1c|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahalim: this can make if you guess everything right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|anton72: double dummy say ...yes ..:)|pg||
nt|anton72: mean GIB|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|westjava: worldclass:)|pg||
nt|mug: clubs was always likely to be declarer's suit|pg||
nt|anton72: still -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rkj_0264: may make 9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 2 aces to come and make all 6 trumps on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: so still a long way to go in this match 10 more boards here and 16 more in the final stanza - with the teams turning over between three and four imps a board still very much ...|pg||
nt|mamos: anyone's match|pg||
nt|psridhar: but i am with both actions taken by them -had logic behind them|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jjsb2: 3Sa a l'autre table pour info , entame @s |pg||
nt|subhranp:  defense would do well to help declarer to take diamond finesse twice..|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|wstuart: Looks like the @D spots are going to get crushed out and he will only lose 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|blewah: not an obvious shift but that's the weakest suit on the table|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|nt|mug: I think a spade back might have been logical, to kill entries to dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|grebrof: not being able to opening 1nt with 5card major, will in many times give you rebid problems|pg||
nt|jjsb2: qui devrait etre a -1 ou moins 2 selon qu'on mette le V de @s ou pas |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|anton72: she can guess 4 cards in partner and i am agree ...diamond looks more normal not J @c|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dgame: 2 imps|pg||
nt|wstuart: After the Q to the K and teh J to the A, he will have to guess whether the 8 or the T is coming down next.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznx: she cashed some diamonds first|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: now 10|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: thats a cardinal sin -not drawing trumps :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|westjava: foult to setup @D|pg||
nt|hlortz: right|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jjsb2: ici 3@c gagne et cela devrait faire un petit swing pour nos couleurs |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|blewah: W can have 3334m|pg||
nt|mug: Dhondy banked on split diamond honours, unfortunately...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mug: if North had five clubs he would probably have led one instead of a spade from J-x-x|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: dsm cn pick 3 or 1 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wstuart: bummer|pg||

nt|ritong: well, in truth the number of cards in other major is a factor|pg||
nt|ritong: but too long to develop  next:)|pg||
nt|ritong: we won t know if poizat would open 1NT, because chambers will be in, but i think he would|pg||
nt|jjsb2: a l'autre table on a mis le V mais la defense est toujours en controle pour faire chuter |pg||
nt|subhranp: .|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1nt pass|pg||
nt|psridhar: a missed opprtunity for dsm there|pg||
nt|psridhar: by not drawing trumps he can make 3@D  there?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|alnanda: of course worldclass, if not, they could not enter semifinals|pg||
nt|hlortz: restricted choice no?  10/8 or 10/7 twice as likely as 87 ??|pg||
nt|psridhar: i doubt it|pg||
nt|psridhar: @s ruff was more probable |pg||
mb|p|nt|alnanda: :) :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s look routine for NS on 7|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h or a preemptive 3@h?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|yo_yo: ah not this time|pg||
nt|hlortz: as yes as kib says when 7 falls they are equivalent...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try a semi psych 1Nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: this deal should be an easy 3N for NS|pg||
nt|subhranp:  that was bad defence by ashish after D9 frm partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3Nt makeable too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if South bids only 2@s, North should find another bid|pg||
nt|ahalim: slam time now|pg||
nt|subhranp: kushari may bid 2c|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3@s shows shortage with both minors|pg||
nt|subhranp:  2n showing both minors|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|subhranp: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: not so sure about world class - 7D was worth an imp - but scary if 2 defensive club tricks available|pg||
nt|ahalim: you mean semi-finals of Venice Cup ! Not semi-finals in Depok yes|pg||
nt|hlortz: eh walter 'big train' is feeding me all the good answers i cofess |pg||
nt|blewah: 3@c puppet stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: its a blackwood hand|pg||

nt|buddyshah: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=884|pg||
nt|szalay: no doubt 3@H was invitational|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|wstuart: Luckily, N doesn't have the @DT or he might go -2.|pg||
nt|mug: she could have set up the long club I suppose|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d must be showing 1 or 2 4card M|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is, of course it gobbles up way less space, but situation is less clear for the opponents|pg||
nt|ritong: here, anything goes as we can see|pg||
nt|ritong: when the NS nine cards fit is disclosed|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1d 1c 2 h|pg||
nt|subhranp: arvind probably considering a balancing dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: but who can argue with success Victor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT = a good raise|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nt mixed raise i think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D - 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, some think its important to have 5-3 in the majors for allowing opening 1nt, but I haven see the problem to frequent I actually consider it|pg||
nt|farfie: bon,retour de quelques points,nous sommes à moins d'un swing|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 3Sa aurait probablement assez bien joue |pg||
nt|jjsb2: 5@c ou 5@d sera bien plus delicat |pg||
nt|farfie: il devrait redire 4sa|pg||
nt|farfie: négatif|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: balancing double with 7 points suicidal|pg||
nt|subhranp:  some relief for hemant jalan on Board-3 when Shree reached the wrong slam and went down|pg||
mb|4D|nt|wstuart: A @D lead will beat it 2 by force, but that's going to be hard to do.|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a comfortable make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unless trumps are 5-0, declarer can count 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4D - game only - both majors|pg||
nt|ahalim: after E opened 2NT quite possible to reach slam|pg||
nt|mug: but then North plays a diamond and she loses three clubs, a diamond and a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Senior had 6@D in her hand but back again....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the delay suggests I am wrong or is Neveena just excited by her super max|pg||
nt|subhranp: declarer will have to play diamonds correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: ça c'est inattendu|pg||
mb|4H|nt|farfie: la pression c'est pour tout le monde|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  can play to ruff a @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: claim?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: i have a queation: where does the score (31-16) come from?|pg||
nt|mug: phew|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 6 @h went down by wrong guess in @s -board 6 -so Monaco got 13 insteat of Zeerob rood |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: vice versa|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe the delay was checking the system|pg||
nt|blewah: 9 control hand, not very often you have|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: 3@h often includes a shortness  nice hit by chambers|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaker: 10 imps back|pg||
nt|westjava: plus carry over|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: click on movies for board by board imps|pg||
nt|dgame: ok tks|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5 over 5 is ususally thought wrong but here its +450vs looks like -100|pg||
nt|blewah: play will be very quick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ritong: mais...|pg||
nt|ritong: oups|pg||
nt|grebrof: another reason is that we are conventional over the transfer in Norway so we do sometimes miss a 5-3 fit in the other major - with a GF hand at the responders hand I do have the ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: perfect systtem for you  - lots of relays thou|pg||
nt|ritong: so, the contract looks bulletproof, so boyd tries to consider the worst which might happen|pg||
nt|ritong: and see if there are countermeasures possible in that (rare) case|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes vice versa ..:) -ok you all got the point anyway -6 @h in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: now there are some problems to get to  the 4th @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew  can make some 3 @c -but not so easy to come in |pg||
nt|henryb:  that may have been the only lead to let declarer come home|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mug: I think West's bidding was simply choice of game, no slam interest|pg||
nt|anton72: other room stop in 4 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and claim|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think that the @c-cut still is the best optiom|pg||

pc|d4|nt|buddyshah: not a @H discard|pg||

nt|ritong: @d values are not that bright|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he goes ahead  okay|pg||
nt|psridhar: one disadv with that trf to 3 level is you are contracting for 2 tricks higher -but several adv like 1. dummy comes into play 2. they balance more often over 3@C thatn 1N etc|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Edgtton that is|pg||
nt|szalay: very good slam, especially after East's opening|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest never erasy to bid slam when opponents start with 1N, strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 5@H|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they get too high here?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lontoh 63: somebody tell me that D. Rosenberg does not belong in this competition ..... any reason for this.|pg||

nt|szalay: is 5@C exclusion here?|pg||
nt|szalay: or spl? or nat?|pg||
nt|ritong: right spot is 6@c, icecold when trumps2/2|pg||
nt|ritong: now they can wnader in NTs, and now @h J on becomes useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: last bord here 4 @s ns with 20 points migth make at least after bad defence ..if you are optimistic -normally some 9 --3 @d is difficult|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT certainly shows hearts|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2NT shows a good hand of some sort - i suspect|pg||
nt|mwigor: (remember his range was 3-7)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6 will win|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong about our score, Paul?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: last round bd 16 was wrong|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: technical difficulties|pg||
nt|westjava: as usual:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EAst might open 4@S with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 4@c making vs. 2NT +2 was worth 2 IMPs for Indonesia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: as did Senior in OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|buddyshah: Amazing result   from OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table played in 2 @d so -|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not sure of system but likely maximum|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 2@S = MAX       and playing strenght to 3@H min.|pg||
nt|buddyshah: Interesting  3@C|pg||
nt|buddyshah: he wants to buy the contract|pg||
nt|buddyshah: 3@C = @C + @S      Inviting  4@S  thans  to Kib :)|pg||

nt|subhranp: precision 1c, 1s response is probably a transfer to 1n|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: Dewi upgrades her hand to 18 bal now|pg||
nt|farfie: je rappelle pour les kibs que les françaises ont gagné la Venice cup ,leurs adversaires n'ont pas souhaité jouer le dernier quart temps devant le retard accumulé|pg||

mb|p|nt|szalay: but when we have 8 good @Cs, its tough|pg||

nt|don_kapu: hi brother hood|pg||
nt|mamos: England lead by 30 mps WE think  but WE are unofficial and know nothing|pg||
nt|mug: one of those "even-money" slams which in truth are much worse than even money|pg||
nt|mug: as you need the red suits to behave as well as @SA right|pg||
nt|ritong: but first, they have to reach a slam  not clearcut|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lontoh 63: you are right almondo|pg||
nt|westjava: for sure, pls give a neutral comment pls...|pg||

nt|mug: but I think you can make it if you need to|pg||

nt|psridhar: not a championlike display by bhabesh this deal -both in auction and play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  what happened on the ruling was that NS had a RKCB sequence. South showed 1 key card. North asked for the trump queen. South denied it but there was a hesitation involved. North then bid the slam.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mamos: South held Jxxx|pg||

nt|westjava: what's the meaning, om don?:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: hi Julian.......|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director left without saying anything...|pg||
nt|szalay: France took the lead|pg||
nt|ritong: score it up  next|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2@H was played back en Poizat take te|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the 2 of hearts was played back Poizat take the Q|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a little break|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jm can handle 4@H here, but the @s spots will worry him|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1@h-2@d-2@h-p-2@s-p-3@h -all pass is possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: that will be an easy 140 for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: another pancake boards|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: dsm may loos some imps on this board|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@H will be challenging if he punts for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: probably 3@h now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mug: weak notrump and 2@S Asptro, spades and another|pg||
nt|blewah: just wanted to to distract you :)|pg||
nt|ritong: same goes:)|pg||
nt|subhranp: manoj may bid 1n here|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: 1@S opening by S and may N reapond with 2@H|pg||
nt|westjava: and flat board again, don?|pg||
nt|ahalim: N trying to steal the @S;s|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is a good result for Indonesia, since North-South can make quite a lot of clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have good spade fit but East's @h honours are not working so well - East's 1@h overcall will warn West of this|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 5@c looks good|pg||
nt|mug: 2D I meant|pg||
nt|jjsb2: 4@s a l'autre table et je pense qu'ici se sera pareil |pg||
nt|subhranp:  lal has a problem here, has a good hand but no convenient bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: the bidding looks odd on this board in the OR|pg||
nt|farfie: 3sa pas mal..|pg||
mb|p|nt|lontoh 63: and 4 @S will be landing ..|pg||
nt|don_kapu: i rhink so oom west|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is funny for NS but not funny for EW|pg||
nt|ritong: so philippe passed 3@s, when it could easily stay there|pg||
nt|ritong: now, he has further info|pg||
nt|ritong: no, schermer prefers a standard psych|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@c lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: peuyeum muda|pg||
nt|yo_yo: p p p 4@H?|pg||
mb|d|nt|eok: Well see. I also have G to deal with.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East might hit this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @hAQ have gone up in value|pg||
nt|blewah: S hand value has increased a lot after that 2@c|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT wont be a success I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  at the other table East bid 2@d to show majors, so North-South never bid clubs at all|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps it will :0|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyone opt for 4 @s wirg Ss hand?|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: -1|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: min|pg||
nt|psridhar: i didnt expect that 2N ....i wd prefer XXX,QJX,Q10XX,AXX for that bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: or @h 5|pg||
nt|westjava: odd and strange|pg||
nt|ahalim: the operator bid like that|pg||
nt|blewah: 1@d 15-17 bal or 11/12-15 unbal|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it was just the final contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  choices of 4@c, 5@c and 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: -6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dgame: dont play @s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: skinny game - well done|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: lead out of turn |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: suhas lead the @h Q and open the screen |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Director on table and giving 5 options to Kista|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Suhas lead and himself opened the window |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Kista made J M Shah as declarer |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: can not show the play |pg||
nt|vugraphztt: will update the result|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|don_kapu: woww|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: brown is looking very weird when seeing the dummy|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West would like a @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: how did W infered that @s?|pg||
nt|anton72: looks like we all can get a last 4-5 boards in the most tied match ....Italy lead only 3 imps |pg||
nt|mug: needs to draw trumps or @S8 will be promoted|pg||
nt|mug: don't see how else she might reasonably play though|pg||
nt|mug: scratch that, @S9 is big enough |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps it was an invite, after all|pg||
nt|subhranp: he has 7 tricks|pg||
mc|6|nt|westjava: ok|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok operator error,  easy to do when they play fast |pg||
nt|westjava: every body so tired there|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the operator in the OR just had some difficulties during the bidding :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, South bid 1NT rather than double, so she does not have spades, and North bid the minors so she does not have spades|pg||
nt|ritong: guy lasserre went for the secret weapon  not sure it will be good|pg||
nt|ritong: criteria for weak twos are different from ours|pg||
nt|ritong: rebonjour|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on ne peut pas jeter assez de perdante sur les @h en pratique le cotnrat de 4@s ne gagne pas |pg||
nt|jjsb2: salut :) |pg||
nt|psridhar: from JM's pt of view if kista held 10XX,QJX,Q10XX,KXX , 3N may be a winner but he has guessed well with his 3@H|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: after some time :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: what is the infraction ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N: " I psyched"|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: the director is asking NS about their psyching habits|pg||

nt|westjava: teams KO from semi finals play in Transnational : http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=884|pg||
nt|grebrof: I still would lead @s . you need 5 @cs with P or 4 good ones and 2 entries|pg||
nt|ritong: first clear good board for USA|pg||
nt|jjsb2: je fait reference à cette demi finale .. pour ceux qui ont suivi ... qui c'est joue sur la derniere donne pour gagner de 1IMP , en fait 0,33imp...|pg||
nt|jjsb2: apparemment une donne sans encombre ici |pg||

nt|ianco: k|pg||

nt|rkj_0264: hi|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: 1nt fr ns|pg||
nt|psridhar: these bal hands wont serve DSM's cause|pg||
nt|subhranp:  last board of this set here|pg||
nt|subhranp:  good score for EW on the other side|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: thanks all , last deal here |pg||
mb|1H|nt|dgame: "plong"|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no|pg||
nt|jjsb2: on joue 3Sa à l'autre table |pg||
nt|psridhar: but then when an odd swingy deal came along they stuffed it , so..Jalan it is all the way this semi so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  at this level you can place a degree of confidence in what the opponents are doing|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphznx: they will play for 3rd place|pg||
nt|dburn:  here is another possible game in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  but so far no one has bid those except West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find after West bid the suit|pg||
nt|subhranp: interesting last board, both sides have big fit in either minor but neither side makes game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb2: mais sans encombre est bien sur de trop .. tout les IMP vont comptes , c'est certains ! |pg||
mb|2C|nt|subhranp: last board here|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jalan have so far played 26 deals this semi losing just 19 imps they deserve to win |pg||
nt|buddyshah: 6 boards to compare  37 imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: dbl showing 5-7 hcp|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn:  this game didn't have to make at the other table, did it?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: a playoff that is with less boards than the finals|pg||
nt|westjava: u r right Paul, the others I mean|pg||
nt|dburn:  South may have a chance now, if 3@c is natural (as it should be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North has the right sort of shape to X 2@s but not enough values|pg||
nt|mamos: south might dbl and N bid Clubs|pg||
nt|mug: I wonder why Dhondy didn't upgrade this hand to an opening 1NT?|pg||
nt|grebrof: good bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: si ils nous refont le plan de la demi finale, je prendrai quelques jours de repos|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  I guess it did, once South led a spade|pg||
nt|alnanda: @s lead|pg||
nt|blewah: what is 3@s?|pg||
nt|farfie: je ne pense pas qu'ils vont entamer ça,dans l'autre salle|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but North had not opened, so South didn't know what to lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but about 1,000 IMPs have been lost in this tournament so far by people who cannot bid the opponents' non-suits naturally|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: and having bid 2D South should run when doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be tempted to save with the east hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N shaking her head, she didn t want to alert 3@s :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: most likely go drn, but|pg||
nt|ritong: good chances of a duplicated auction|pg||
nt|ritong: so, gathering maximum of tricks in order  making it not that relevant|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: i see|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: i think that  pass by S   "timid"|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West's 1@c is either clubs or a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  and that, in times when both 1@c and 1@d are frequently short suits, is really not very sensible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would get an alert where I play|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, bye all|pg||
nt|ritong: presumably 2@d shows 5@h when 2@h would show 6+|pg||
nt|jjsb2: oui pardon j'ai dit sans encombre en considerant que l'entame @h ne venait pas "facilement"|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jjsb2: entame @s à l'autre table |pg||
nt|psridhar: finally a chance for dsm to win 6 i thk they will|pg||
nt|subhranp:  this should be duplicated|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|blewah: unfavorable vulnerability. a bit conservative maybe by S, though|pg||
nt|ritong: now the toughes part  make it|pg||
nt|ritong: toughest*|pg||
nt|ritong: finding @hs was tough already|pg||
nt|psridhar: if def doesnt attack @d early enuf can he make this?|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps even a trump at every stage may defeat -decl doesnt have tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mug: ah well, they got there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: didnt do so well last time- does that affect her?|pg||
nt|subhranp: this board should be quits, well played poddar.|pg||
nt|subhranp: manoj should drop CK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|alnanda: next world championship 2013, Indonesia to host , we must prepare ourselves as organizers and achievement|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzts: kista smells the slam |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, maybe. But if East had held the ace of clubs and West the ace of hearts, 3NT doubled would have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well maybe East would have led a heart - we can maybe all day - I am too old and cowardly to want to be in 3NTx on the N/S cards |pg||
nt|dburn:  oh, I don't say I would want to be in it either - I am also an old coward|pg||
pc|dK|nt|farfie: bon...tant pais|pg||
nt|vugraphzts: next session at 4:00 PM IST 20 mins from now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|farfie: pis|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can try a @d to jack and hope they dont cash their @c -unlikely|pg||
pc|hT|nt|subhranp:  good set for shree..hemant jalan have to play much better in the next sets to be in the contest|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|westjava: yes sir! we get ready!:)|pg||
nt|ritong: situation is supermurky for shermer  the @c 8 is not readable|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer  sry|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was, he would have underlead his @d A confidently|pg||
nt|ritong: underled*|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, i do not think the contract can be beaten up to that point|pg||
nt|ritong: not by technical ways, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the fact that this @c Jack mighta been useful as en entry to @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: board 10 proved too difficult for americans as well no (big) swing|pg||
nt|subhranp:  thanks everyone for joining in|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: we will be back for 2nd session after lunch break at 2pm.Till then bye all.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 1+@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphznx: that how it went|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: hey hey peace on earth|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Nicola will be expecting bad breaks from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: schermer::(|pg||
nt|ritong: pard has the darn @d K, but poof|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: i talk about lasserre's state of mind|pg||
nt|ritong: his prebalancing action is obvious, imho, and contract will very likely be the same next room|pg||
nt|ritong: so will be the opening lead, at first sight|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|psridhar: now bhabesh needs to cash his Ace|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the other hand I am in the camp which advocates an opening bid on North so no sympathy when passing costs game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blewah: ruff out some @ds would be my line, can go to hand with trump|pg||
nt|blewah: to table, I mean|pg||
nt|westjava: Venice other SF, France leads 84 - 46.5 imps vs Netherland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the x ruff will work as it happens|pg||
nt|ritong: so his target is to make as many tricks as reasonably possible, then compare scores|pg||
pc|cT|nt|don_kapu: 6 imp ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might have reopened wih 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  they will have a singleton only when 4=4=4=1 precisely - but they will have a doubleton quite a lot of the time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mug: some pairs simply don't open 1NT with a 5-card majors, for example the three pairs on the Italian open team|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh dear |pg||
nt|buddyshah: oops|pg||
nt|psridhar: a @h hook and he is home|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|westjava: Bali waiting all of us|pg||
nt|blewah: they are becoming minority day by day, i think|pg||
nt|blewah: as 5M332 is gaining popularity all over the world|pg||
nt|blewah: for 1nt, I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rkj_0264: -11|pg||
nt|subhranp: going down and looks like mavs will bow down to the might of DSM|pg||
nt|subhranp: thanks everyone for joining in|pg||
nt|rkj_0264: moverick shd resign|pg||
nt|psridhar: 'did u sleep well last night bhabesh'? :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blewah: in CR after garbage stayman Murniati gave up to 2@d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ianco: could  hVE BEEN -2|pg||
nt|ianco: knowing  9@S with ptr  he  should have played @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: think of you as a mere youth David|pg||
nt|mug: Indonesia are in 4@S on 27 too so that leaves this flattish looking board and four more for England to recover 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi aramesh|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, this goes for any given board, but sometimes you have a feeling your spot is not that obvious to reach, and thus a sacrifice of one trick or two, if it ensures the gain, ...|pg||
nt|ritong: can be envisaged|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: so -1 but 2 imps to EW and England|pg||
nt|blewah: i wonder what dbl would mean in their agreement|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ianco: any one ,  who are the other semifinalists?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: I just remembered that Heather is in the camp which always opens 5 card major if system allows|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I can't think this a great contract|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mug: so perhaps the 1NT rebid was wide-range|pg||
nt|MBV53: tonight may not get sleep:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jm has a guess still -does opener have @C ace or @h king?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|nt|subhranp: thanks everyone for joining in|pg||
nt|subhranp: next session in 10 mins|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mug: Mrs Senior playing this nicely for the overtrick|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pg||
