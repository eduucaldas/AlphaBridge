nt|marlowepi: 6H has play too, of course, single dummy. few bidding systems codify announcement or denial of the ten of trumps|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: s10 really|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Board 16 was flat.  Again the stronger NT from West in open room kept opponents out of the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: are the players liable to be fined for slow play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 20 mins to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: So I wouldn't have thought so, although they are one of the only tables left in play|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: can play safe of low and cover next card either way    might have been worried that club lead was either a singleton or from 4  and id not want to lose a trump and then a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: 2@C explained as artificial game forcing, 2@D a relay, 2@S showing 3 card support, 3@D natural, 3@H a cuebid|pg||
