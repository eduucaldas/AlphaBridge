nt|lady007:  welcome to the final of the white house juniors|pg||
nt|lady007:  we saw 2 very close matches yesterday, lets hope it will be just as exciting today!|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we are go|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: lose by 19, because they should lead by 20 :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lool|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lady007:  on the first board EW can make 4@s, even with the bad breaks, but they shouldnt get any higher|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzbn: they play Capp (transfers)  over 1M  -  X  - |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: so 2@s is a weak  raise |pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @S guess i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials segment 2/4 from lahore.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: I missed the bidding but the contract is 2NT by South|pg||
mb|2S|an|f|nt|bebechira: they will bid 4s and will come down to find the trumps quuen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher leads his nice heart sequence instead of his singleton, because he has good spades and is not looking for a ruff|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan Open teams National Trials from Lahore|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzbn: @cQ can be only vital card of the whole deal|pg||
nt|lady007:  now lets see how van den Bos should play. he is probably worried about spades 4-1, but the bidding makes it more likely its with north than with south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: if you misguess can eliminate @c and @d and let them open the @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: queen even|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: but won't work here|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: reverse flannery 2@S response would work on this hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lady007:  he pitches a diamond, because if diamonds are 32, he can always discard a club on the diamonds later|pg||
nt|lady007:  north might have made it more difficult for declarer here to duck his ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Shirley, Martin|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: why not dennis :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Farrukh planning discards|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  welcome back for the exciting conclusion of this intense match|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this is the 3rd and final session of this final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: hi marshall|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Mashall |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi shirley:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: in case both teams finish tied Netherlands Red wins the tournament as they were ranked higher in the Swiss|pg||
nt|bebechira: it will not happen twice Dennis|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  what if only one team finishes tied?:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: we had it 3 or 4 years ago, tie-break in both semi-final and final|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  do we know why the organizers use that tie-break method instead of extra boards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if east ducks club queen can i see any hope for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: there was a reason, but can't remember it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: n already place after the @D :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: nice|pg||
nt|bobholl: placed|pg||
nt|xenya:  an ambitious 3N -- 1@S showed both majors?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no doubt to be sure the tournament finishes at a specific time|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: probably has to do with time schedules for flights home |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobholl: J@H his only possibilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by joris (or just lucky ?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: this final consists of 3 sessions of 14 boards|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|lady007:  declarer cant ruff his club anymore, but he can discard it on the diamonds. so 10 tricks it is|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||

nt|bebechira: any imp important |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Sorry got disconnected ....4@s is being played |pg||
nt|lady007:  2@d transfer, showing hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can even make 6@h here on the very lucky layout of the cards, but most likely they will get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Fisher bid 4@s because of his 64 but he wont buy a very usefull dummy. this can get expensive|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzbn: Hello and welcome to Pakistan open teams national trials FINAL segment 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: I DONT bid on west garbage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the best reason for bidding on the W garbage is that doing so might assist you in your choice of lead against the final contract. feedback from E could be crucial|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well either 4@H or 5@D is better, but west has to find a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that lead not bad for declarer |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: juniors bid 4@H seniors like me 3@H :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzbn: routine +1|pg||
nt|lady007:  this will be at least 800|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i have always been a chicken |pg||

nt|lady007:  hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: after these one is gonna be 5 min.break tks.all|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi:  i find it a bit odd to lead a spade. why not attack the suit that can provide the most tricks when it is right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: so van den Bos knows that they cannot cash 4 @ss now|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs suggesting 6 @D by S pretty good  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 12 tricks in hearts as they lay    but  this will be a poor result for Israel|pg||
nt|lady007:  if EW can avoid playing diamonds, declarer might face a nast guess to avoid 1100|pg||

nt|grebrof: I guess they found the @dshift|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbn: Lead increasing|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  NL lost an opportunity there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade lead required Qxxxx in east as well as a red card, so i tend to agree, Marshall|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi:  but then, so did Israel:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 7@S on  with 3 finesses |pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi:  yes and low spade might well even  block suit when E does have Qxxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  a possible slam hand for NS coming up here|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 flat.. 4s bid and made at both tables|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  oh sorry, i thought W had led from KJ8x|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: nice bid given that they are trying to recover alot of imps this segment|pg||
nt|lady007:  they can make both 6@h and 6@s if they guess the spades (and possible the clubs, on a unlikely club lead if played by north)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to small slam   and make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry @C wrong so 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now i see it is the 5|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|qasim2003: i'd bid 4@h with the S hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a true yarborough in N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not even a 10 makes it a yarb)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S would LIKE to bid 3D as a lead-director over 2H, byut that could work out poorly|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: Fisher knows that he can save for a probable 500, but decides not to|pg||
mb|4H|nt|qasim2003: but 3@h makes so a nice result for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess he 'll show a good "pudding"raise now|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 4@c should show 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  hmmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this reminds me of a friend -  has no dbl in my mind|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s seems rather passive|pg||
nt|bobholl: joris inspired ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think he should pass now. 4@s shows a bad hand for slam (else 4@c)|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell him not to pass Dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: without @c lead it's one out of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 trupms and 12 points doubtfull|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: with @c lead you need @dK onside (best chance)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: you don't finesse @c at trick 1 as you need at least another finesse, take @cA and finesse @d only 1 finesse needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S has no|pg||
nt|ady: no   not even a try from North   maybe direct raise to 3 limited with their methods|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: pity but understandable|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: although you need the 4th @d to be good as well...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: he likes this :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  at different colors the risk of 3D might be less|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but at these colors it wouldnt take much for N to save at 5D with a fit. here for example:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  of course a save might be ok, but if he has a stiff heart you probably want to defend|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: though 12 tricks can be made    not a good contract|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|grebrof: 2@c will make some tricks thou - especially now - if @ds are played correctly|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: now club to king is almost 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if S has stiff club not so good though|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|grebrof: that was a nobrainger|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|bebechira: Israel in 4 as well in the open room..so it will be flat|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: but he elected to show a good hand for NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  though a second sapde might find 22 spades in which case he could take the club finesse|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  3N mildly tricky here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ady: 3NT a fair contract e/w   but wrecked by the bad diamond split|pg||
nt|lady007:  3nt is a good contract but it is unlikely to make on this lay out (diamonds 41) and van Lankveld didnt believe in such a good hand from his partner and didnt try for game|pg||
nt|lady007:  will south get in with a double?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 7 on this hand |pg||
nt|bebechira: has to be...they had only 30 mins between set1 and set2|pg||
nt|sybarra: how pushy is N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south may balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  of course W likely to lead club K but if not then S still has a safety play|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|mc|11|nt|bobholl: even 6 is on a finesse or j rd of @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: missing @H ace is likely to be cashed in 7 |pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|grebrof: last board is a good example why a bad 6 card minor operates better when opening 1nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: another slam|pg||
mb|6D|nt|lady007:  4@s the likely contract on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  will W open in 3rd at these colors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or not |pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|grebrof: say 1nt-2@c :3minor - then your P knows your @ds are not great and that your Hs are somewhere else|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: are they playing the same boards :S 5@c vs 1NT and now 6@s vs 1@h :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I am a passer with W most times,  no spades, lousy hand,  (decent rebid however 2 @c) |pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: difficult hand with N if you don't have a convention now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bebechira: welcome to Martin Johnson :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzyf: 3@d GF here, that's not surprising. But nowadays more pairs play this as INV 5-5 with a 2@c gadget|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or forcing but always 55|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  why not just 2S from N ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for me 2nt over 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: for results www.nbbportal.nl/1003|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  partner wont have 4 spades so 2S is safe and cheap|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is forcing and often unbalanced but not 55|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: then choose 'competitie'|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S might also put them off a spade lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: sorry it is S playing,  skip that remark |pg||
pc|d7|mc|12|nt|marlowepi:  i want partner to know i have diamonds when i bid 3D, so he can make the bid that befits his hand without needing to worry if the 3D call was just an invention|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 2@S is ok if that is your understanding, either way the jump shift without rules is not effective|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i dont mind inventing suits, but not when the call that does so takes up a lot of space|pg||

mb|p|nt|lady007:  wow, wild hand here|pg||
nt|ady: Israel gained 3 imps on hand 4 where 2@D was down 4     also 1NT opened by east   and west scrambled to 2 hearts  3 down|pg||
nt|lady007:  what to bid with van Lankvelds hand?|pg||
nt|ady: what a freak|pg||
mb|p|nt|tipu: 17 is the difference|pg||
nt|tipu: with still 10 boards to come|pg||

nt|ady: did not take lon to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: van Lankveld putting up a smile when Fisher looks at him as if he's crazy|pg||
nt|bebechira: when they score up..thats another matter|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lady007:  he decided that a jump to 5@s wont help as his partner has no clue when to raise anyway|pg||

mb|1H|nt|tipu: We have what we wanna see|pg||
nt|bebechira: another one?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: decent chance to get diamond right  on the weak 2 opening|pg||
nt|lady007:  and a 5@s bid might have seen his partner raise to 6 on this hand as well|pg||
nt|bebechira: they just put out of their heads the 5c|pg||

nt|fabsayc: wrong idea, south needs to declare|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: yes, not West :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: non spade lead seems right|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  cold double dummy even without spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  and you would play it in the way that works|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: he can set up 4th @c without letting North in|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbn: misdefense was the last hope he let it to the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: & they did nt dissappoint him|pg||

nt|bebechira: yes indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the locals here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do you make on diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyf: is a 5th @s, AK of @h and a possibly very valuable @dJ enough to make another bid now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would surely after 5@C |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S by south was ok, but this should go down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: on club lead you could duck|pg||

pc|d5|nt|bebechira: North is considering slam?|pg||

nt|bebechira: hard to make this one|pg||
