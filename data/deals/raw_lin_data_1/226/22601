mb|p|mb|2H|nt|benjent: 2@c is asking for 5-card majors; 2@h is a minimum with 5@h (in their 11-14 range)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Interesting X. I would play that for a @s lead. Liz apparently means it for "lead the right thing, and this is going down"|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|benjent: Good @c lead ... if X doesn't specify a suit, partner would expect it to be their shortage, and should lead that|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: that's logical...|pg||
nt|benjent: Julia can make this by taking the @d finesse (4 tricks thanks to the short K) and then the @h finesse (3 tricks thanks to the short K)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

mc|9|nt|benjent: Bit unlucky for Havas there. Short honours galore and good pips for EW brought about the extra tricks. And the X got the only lead that gave them a chance|pg||
