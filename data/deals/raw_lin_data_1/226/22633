nt|tez: Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he can derogate|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/3/4 @d is the strongest possible sequence|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcb: I think Simons just said she thought 3@D asked for a @D stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pasman and Simons are now the "Senior" pair on the Dutch team   we had a retirement right Bas?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||
nt|sybarra: period of reorganization then for Neth. Ladies team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Her partner, Carla Arnolds, is now playing with another well-known player, Wietske van Zwol. They are currently playing here as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can not be but so far behind now |pg||
nt|baldjean: was just typing the same, Shirley. the match may become very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier to bd in slam with seeing all the cards |pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|swanson:  East has a shot a 11 tricks in diamonds here.  |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2 more for Holland on bd 6, the other room in 3@S, making the same number of tricks, so 2 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent the Dutch ladies about 40 behind after 1st segment?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson:  If the defenders help clear spades and South fails to drop the @CQ under the ace, he can be endplay for a sluff and ruff.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|agumperz:  bessis probably reasoned that with Axxx, xxx, x, AKJxx that dahl would have bid|pg||
nt|agumperz:  while with the actual hand he would not|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H missing 2 cashing aces is going to bring swings - sadly out not in|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the case of the dog that did not sing in the night|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is useful to inquire futher|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@d seems to be a nice contract|pg||
nt|baldjean: Cor, with the Dutch team being so fat behind at tge start of this session they will probably go for any possible slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|mcphee: what happened to board 40?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck here for amoils|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|swanson:  I don't see Bianchedi sitting for this.  Partner needs a spade stopper and teh @DA.|pg||
nt|ritong: even if opener has 4@hs, they will be useful in a @s contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|agumperz:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry tired|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not particularly scared about getting trumpshortened here|pg||

pc|h5|nt|frankaus: we say ....... no worries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The screen sometimes becomes embedded in the mind :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|baldjean: oops, computer being a bit slow here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a rather unpleasant distribution  |pg||
pc|s9|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|swanson:  I don't know what 4@S implies but West should hae been putting on the brakes.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson:  Now the endplay is for down one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@s explained as "cuebid"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  West's bidding is a little too agressive |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now some bickering|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead req by Friedland|pg||

nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not just bridge partner |pg||
nt|kingcur: that's very sad news indeed :( may she rest in peace|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ritong: straightforward, eh?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
