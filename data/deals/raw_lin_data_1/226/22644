mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Christina Lund Madsen - Anne Sofie Houlberg, Lone Bilde - Helle Rasmussen and Nadia Bekkouche - Dorthe Schaltz. Fine team, top 5 is my estimate|pg||

nt|psyck: RKC would have allowed them to discover the lack of a KC & trump Q; but they had solid side suits they wanted to show instead|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|agumperz:  but when your chance of winning by playing normal bridge is almost none|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: robles will be disappointed|pg||
nt|ritong: missing an ace, no grand today|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  you can only try to mix it up and hope for the best|pg||
nt|frankaus: XX usually a Hon|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d shows an intermediate hand at this vul i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: will make it difficult for NS to find their @h spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have bid 3@S as west (stopper ask) :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: where do we end here? |pg||
mb|4S|nt|dimi: 3NT is the right contract for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  ish has a big hand|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but his K of clubs is wasted|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and clearly their style is to enter the auction aggressively|pg||
nt|agumperz:  so i am guessing he passes|pg||
nt|frankaus: KC  - wil reveal 2 cont missing|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the 5-level would be too high if spades were 6-1|pg||
nt|psyck: only problem is you have a couple of other suits you would like stoppers in too :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this leads to same result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: 3@h is only one down|pg||
nt|psyck: S did well here|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice support from arnolds :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: east did well to ty the @C finesse once more. NS lead 2nd from bad holdings / top from inner sequence, since she had the 10 and and saw 3 honors the 9 was consistant to K98... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: other finesses were also available but a bit more dangerous|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfe: No defense to this one|pg||
nt|agumperz:  good judgement by Del'Monte|pg||
nt|frankaus: i hava a saying - if my g'ma had wheels - i would be a bus :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first task for south was to find @CQ, that is solved, but then she must get two @D tricks and solve trumps without running into a @C ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: this will prove no difficulty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Has to play N for Club K|pg||
nt|mcphee: certainly sensible on the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ok, can u translate that for the slower non-aussies like me?|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Laughter at the table :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzcd: Robles thinking ...|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough|pg||
nt|tez: if you open with this hand..i belive you must bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|tez: with east hand|pg||
nt|ritong: 5NT should be key check here, but need an agreement|pg||
nt|tez: agree?|pg||
nt|tez: Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he can derogate|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/3/4 @d is the strongest possible sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: so, even if opening is based on aggressivity, east must cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: imho|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it leaves blackwood door open|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have shown the @c suit too with South's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, don't often find 5 trumps not show in the bidding :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: can actually dble hook @C to his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: robles decided that @c A is out  makes sense|pg||
nt|tomi2: perheps she will play @SA @S towards the jack to get another entry for a @D finesse. other chance is to duck a @D and try spde finesse|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: just about anything works|pg||
nt|tomi2: that sees a fair line, needs @SK with the opening leader|pg||
nt|tomi2: but now the club might get ruffed if east continues the suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 3 from west is a tricky card, hard to read as high from doubleton :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfe: Incorrect, club 10 then wins later with out a club|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|tomi2: from the count signal in @D east should know that there is only one @D left with south, I think its impossible to prevent that ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|tomi2: west could have / perhaps did play a suit preferance signal in the 2nd @D trick with her remaining spotcards to help partner|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably me too |pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: low to 8:)|pg||
nt|ritong: and gets imps, when other room auction was a tad hasty|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Yup, club 8 save the contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but they are in safe contract |pg||

nt|sbeatty:  It appears that Falk could have succeeded by winning the @CA, drawing trumps and losing a @C and 1 @D but his line is very normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Back|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of backwards in scheme of life however |pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W beered her p :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|an|!D+!S|nt|sybarra: now what are methods?|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s have to be a bid careful hee, |pg||
nt|sybarra: played with open cards you can probably make 6 @C |pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H EW here, slam on finesse. But S unlikely to remain silent at these colours|pg||
nt|tomi2: after 240 imps in 36 boards yesterday the dutch dealing machines produced some flat boards, so we are happy to see a @D7 instead of all those swings yesterday :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W seemed very unsure whether to alert or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: E explained it as @S+@D, W wrote something down|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play with screens, right?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Yes. W also wrote down @S+@D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sbeatty:  ahhh :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dimi: 6@c works because the trumpf K is well placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then she should bid 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra: do you want to play 6 @H or 6 @C?|pg||
nt|kingcur: was just looking at that|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is NOT match points|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  they will make a slam try on the way|pg||
nt|agumperz:  like that 3@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it a slam you want to be in?|pg||
nt|dimi: not really < 25%|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt they will bid it with K@c missing|pg||
nt|dimi: oops <50%|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 @S meant? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afraid I could never stop pard in the "boss" suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  was 1 @S alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh, I did not expect pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: I thought S would make some try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Double checked that 2S is the contract|pg||
nt|agumperz:  oops|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C probbly has more options|pg||
nt|kingcur: +a|pg||
mb|p|nt|sbeatty:  I am a little surprised that South both opened and rebid with his hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: thats better|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told it means 3 or fewer spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cor re 6 @C |pg||
nt|tomi2: south could double. it needs a very bad day to see 10 tricks but it might well be down for 500 or 800 or more|pg||
pc|h5|nt|agumperz:  4@S is RKC i take it|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe not LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4S=KC|pg||
nt|tomi2: she has very decent trumps, an ace and partner might have something as well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson:  The question here is: can declare arrange seven tricks before the defense gets their seve.|pg||
nt|swanson:  seven|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: @h7, maybe|pg||
nt|tez: or 9|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|agumperz:  now we get to see if they remember their methods|pg||
nt|tez: i bet he will lead t of @c |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I didn't notice it hadn't registered, sorry|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be down|pg||
nt|dimi: after @h lead of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be another chance for Dutch ladies?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: well whatever the system,  they seemed to have missed a an 8 card and a 9 card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: and give credit to n/s,  didnt push |pg||
nt|baldjean: thiis may be another chance for the Dutch team to catch up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kingcur: not made up my mind yet if I'd want to be a slam here. How about you, Jean?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla thinks if they fear a @S ruff may be no @H finesse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sbeatty:  So declarer's plan od to establish a spade for the 7th trcik ...|pg||
nt|frankaus: nned to get @D right - odds againts it IMO|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcb: *Pasman|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|agumperz:  when partner has shown a red 2-suiter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|swanson:  The defenders simply don't have anywhere to find enough tricks.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|agumperz:  perhaps its not a great idea to cue the KQ of spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: Dahl will show him AK @C  then 1s A |pg||
nt|frankaus: @Sa|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 3@H opening put some pressure on EW, I agree to their bidding. both players were hoping for a bit better cards in partners hand but they could not find out|pg||

nt|frankaus: singing getting louder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I think Simons just said she thought 3@D asked for a @D stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pasman and Simons are now the "Senior" pair on the Dutch team   we had a retirement right Bas?|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla's trick worked perfectly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||
nt|sybarra: period of reorganization then for Neth. Ladies team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Her partner, Carla Arnolds, is now playing with another well-known player, Wietske van Zwol. They are currently playing here as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can not be but so far behind now |pg||
nt|baldjean: was just typing the same, Shirley. the match may become very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier to bd in slam with seeing all the cards |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|swanson:  East has a shot a 11 tricks in diamonds here.  |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2 more for Holland on bd 6, the other room in 3@S, making the same number of tricks, so 2 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent the Dutch ladies about 40 behind after 1st segment?|pg||
nt|tomi2: double digit swings are back. Sweden found the best contract (5@C) on the hand where 3NT had no play, but 4@Sx-2 was 12 back|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|swanson:  If the defenders help clear spades and South fails to drop the @CQ under the ace, he can be endplay for a sluff and ruff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  bessis probably reasoned that with Axxx, xxx, x, AKJxx that dahl would have bid|pg||
nt|agumperz:  while with the actual hand he would not|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H missing 2 cashing aces is going to bring swings - sadly out not in|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the case of the dog that did not sing in the night|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is useful to inquire futher|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@d seems to be a nice contract|pg||
nt|baldjean: Cor, with the Dutch team being so fat behind at tge start of this session they will probably go for any possible slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: what happened to board 40?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck here for amoils|pg||
nt|sybarra: our pards do the same,  bid our voids,  (or is it just me?)|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 sure tricks in NT trade for 8 unsure tricks in @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|swanson:  I don't see Bianchedi sitting for this.  Partner needs a spade stopper and teh @DA.|pg||
nt|ritong: even if opener has 4@hs, they will be useful in a @s contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|agumperz:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry tired|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not particularly scared about getting trumpshortened here|pg||

nt|agumperz:  you have had a hard day's work!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|frankaus: we say ....... no worries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The screen sometimes becomes embedded in the mind :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say 8 ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|baldjean: oops, computer being a bit slow here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a rather unpleasant distribution  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|swanson:  I don't know what 4@S implies but West should hae been putting on the brakes.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|swanson:  Now the endplay is for down one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@s explained as "cuebid"|pg||

mb|2D|nt|tez: dbl is helps|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D probably promises an unbalanced hand since they opened 1@C on a balanced one with KQxxx@D before|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if wietske (van zwol) now supports @H they migth get @D lead|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not just bridge partner |pg||
nt|kingcur: that's very sad news indeed :( may she rest in peace|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  so he played the spade jack to lure friedland into winning the first spade from a holding of AKxxx|pg||

nt|tez: 4 nt is quantitative in my opinion|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla worth 5@C ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
nt|mouser:  I agree. He dug himself a hole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: North confirms they play Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ritong: in a lot of people' opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: sign me in|pg||
nt|tez: last here..ty all enjoyed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 imp to the dutch :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and 5 @D making 6 no less |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: W will duck with AKxxx 4 sure|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he should|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but Bessis was thinking|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he just failed to sider this possibility|pg||
nt|agumperz:  consider|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: And likely unaware of this sad news, NS are meanwhile on their way to another gain for Holland, staying low in 2@S with other table down in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was looking and only -1 in game is quite good |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ty Henri ty Paula|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzcd: ty |pg||
nt|tez: byees|pg||

pc|c8|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes, she claimed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: debiera cumplir perdiendo 2@d+2@s|pg||
nt|rijase: jugara contra los 18 de paca, pero no parece que tenga problemas para cumplir la mano|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: descartando el @h perdedor en el @c|pg||
nt|baldjean: Important 9@c with N here. excgange it with the 6@c of E, and it makes a lot of difference|pg||
nt|kingcur: and bd 9 another 13 for Holland....wow|pg||
nt|kingcur: Pasman-Simons in the club slam|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: touted off of a ht lead at this table with the hts being in E hand |pg||
nt|baldjean: exchange*|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am looking do n/s still have time to beat it?|pg||
nt|tomi2: east regrets not having bid 3nt, that would save lots of time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rijase: claro|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I daren't say|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|frankaus: another pick up here|pg||
nt|agumperz:  it is easy to judge a play that fails harshly in the moment. Better to think about why it happened.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfe: east is making very very unhappy noises|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: 4PM local|pg||
pc|sK|nt|agumperz:  11 tricks and 8 IMPs to Falk|pg||
nt|agumperz:  giving them 5 boards to regain 73 IMPs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  where is that lady Frank?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: 20 min or so |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think) |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|agumperz:  Peter is an excellent player and very competitive he hates to lose a trick, even a meaningless overtrick.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|swanson:  West is probably not in a cheerful mood either.|pg||
nt|sybarra: top of next hour |pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: perdón, 5 por jugar en esta sala, 7 por comparar, en la sala abierta están jugando la 26|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last now,  thx Bas for great job as always |pg||
nt|kingcur: and another 6|pg||
nt|kingcur: and this might not be a minus result for the Dutch either|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: My pleasure :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mouser:  this one looks pretty flat for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|swanson:  The term for the 4@S sacrafice around here is 'air ball' - it goes down more than the value of a game which isn't making.|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Dimitri and Jeanine   |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|dimi: the session was clearly dominated by a good Swedish team, thx all cu later|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to specs for all of the comments and system help |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|*|nt|ritong: joaquin getting cheeky:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: dutch ladies need to regroup now |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  This match has been an excellent performance by the Amoils team|pg||
nt|kingcur: S looking at a 15 count, but it looks like Emmenthal cheese, it lacks shape and she has a 1NT opener behind her, making it very dangerous to bid at these colours|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H or pass always a (difficult) guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rijase: Rafa, ganan algún clasificatorio por esta copa?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D two way drury?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|agumperz:  to end the Cinderella run of the Falk team|pg||
pc|c2|nt|agumperz:  The Falk team played extremely well until this match|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and deserved to be here|pg||
nt|agumperz:  my guess is that playing 4 handed finally caught up with them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The Falk team was outstanding!|pg||
nt|baldjean: I thought you might have used another nautic metaphor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I tried "righting the ship" |pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzcd: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: es el torneo de equipos más antiguo del Club de Bridge Santiago|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: y el más importante|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: could not think of another one |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: They're making water :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: how about "changing course"?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works!! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Hoist all the sails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works also Bas |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mouser:  not opening 2 spades by north is too sound for me|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2: creative lead by south, good partner was awake/aware and did not try the discovery play of @CT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s7|nt|ritong: north had a difficult bid|pg||
nt|baldjean: or "damn the torpedos and full sped ahead"|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sbeatty:  Looks like 6H 3C and a S or ruff for a make|pg||
nt|kingcur: In the Open room, W opened 1@C and E bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: making it slightly less dangerous for S to bid|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|kingcur: N elected to pass the dbl, probably in an attempt to control damage|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|agumperz:  they should be very proud of themselves for their performance in this event|pg||
