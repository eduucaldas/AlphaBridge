nt|jain: no diff|pg||
nt|bhallak:  It is always making on @S finesse. Additional chance if @S doesn't work, @D does. |pg||

nt|r_tibre: they may lose on 5, and gain a few on 6|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: this table is already 2 brds ahead|pg||
nt|rv: maybe there is a message they need to pause and slow down a bit, especially Badal and Chotan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|r_tibre: have never seen them play slow, or let the scoreline dominate their thought process|pg||

nt|rv: 4@h is beaten on @c lead here|pg||
nt|r_tibre: or shift|pg||
nt|rv: in CR, E-W have taken save in 5@d for only 1 down|pg||
nt|psyck: was leading a @d to beat 5@d also an option?|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@c last deal|pg||
nt|rv: Hi CK, good afternoon, yes only @d lead beats 5@c in last deal|pg||
nt|psyck: hi :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: hi CK|pg||
nt|rv: 3 more brds here, 4 more to be played in CR, 7+14 (in last segment) comparisions left|pg||
nt|psyck: Big lead by the time i woke up to watch|pg||
nt|rv: 38 IMPs in 21 brds, very much possible by playing normal accurate bridge with 5% extra aggression, nothing too fancy required for Manashda|pg||
nt|psyck: RV< how come you are not commenting in the other room where your president is playing? :)|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|rv: 45 mins back, we had Umesh-pd, RA Agarwal-Anand Samant, D.Vijay-KRV as top 3 in Pairs|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: Sunit possibly assumed Swar's pass of 5@d was forcing at these colors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|r_tibre: another opportunity|pg||
nt|rv: this could and should go 2 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but does not work against the non timid Dipak|pg||
nt|drkvas:  better spot|pg||
nt|drkvas:  6@h dbl is par|pg||
nt|jain: is my hunch,yes he has made up for a the many lapses|pg||
nt|bhallak:  much needed IMP's for manasda's team |pg||
