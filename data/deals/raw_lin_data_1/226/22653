nt|tomi2: two pairs play against the Swedish ladies team while the other two pairs play against Dutch open players to have results as well|pg||

nt|tomi2: kib suggests to cash the @D ace to see a signal/dummy, but this would not work since if spade was right you might well need @DA as an entry for the 2nd ruff. two aces and only one ...|pg||

nt|bobholl: will east find another bid ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another slam?|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is some silent bidding. EW have opening + 11hcp and this good club fit and let opps play 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think east hand was worth another bid, maybe a double on 2@D|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|mcphee: so e/w passed up 1400 to defend 4@S dbled to get the extra 30:)|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|mcphee: amoils wonders if he has a shot for a NT game|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: its maybe "easier" if E starts with 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but it is charming|pg||
nt|tomi2: south decided not to open this hand vulnerable, since her opening does not imply a club suit.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzcb: EW discussing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be down a bunch if timed right |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess they play chris (niemijer) non dutchman call it puppet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|baldjean: so, to stay in your metapho, Shirley, it should now be "rudder hard to starboard and full speed ahoi" for NL|pg||
nt|baldjean: metaphor*|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|sybarra: think you got the "drift"  of it |pg||
nt|psyck: They got to 6@d on uncontested bidding on deal 3 in other room.  The Swedes misguessed the Queen of Hearts on deal 1; we will see if the Dutch are better at guessing it now.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: not sure if W can manage 9 tricks in @H. close|pg||
nt|tomi2: K&R (xxx AQx Qx K98xx) = 10.20 - K/R agrees|pg||
nt|grebrof: which would have been an underbid in my mind|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but S has a too weak hand imo|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: nicely controlled auction|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c was shortness|pg||
nt|tez: they lost @d fit|pg||
nt|ritong: right, but in any case @d slam is not awesome|pg||
nt|ritong: has the merit to make|pg||
nt|tez: 1@d 1@s 1NT 2@D(GF) 2@S 3@D...|pg||
nt|ritong: to make easily, even, since it is so bad there is no choice of line|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure clear how to time it right |pg||
nt|psyck: @c lead against 6@d there too, so no @h guess required|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mcphee: 3@D is w warp|pg||

nt|grebrof: some still make a neg dbl of 2@d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: or last train 4@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@s..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dimi: will make a lot of overtricks now|pg||
nt|psyck: if 4@d sets the suit, they could get to slam now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: here N has opened, so small is more in favour than the small one - she played with the odds in isolation and played the Q of @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: just an imp :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - only lose a little :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @H you have an extra trick|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 3@S did set the (wrong) suit :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's a disappointment|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: I am afraid that if I opened S hand I would have rebid 2 @C |pg||
nt|psyck: yes, after the gf bid (4th suit); the next bid generally sets suit i suppose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: 3N serious NT apparently|pg||
nt|bobholl: in the other room east (carla arnolds) said she had a weak two @D :)|pg||

nt|psyck: RKC would have allowed them to discover the lack of a KC & trump Q; but they had solid side suits they wanted to show instead|pg||
nt|sybarra: have to stay out of slam here,|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's 7 to sweden :(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|agumperz:  but when your chance of winning by playing normal bridge is almost none|pg||
nt|bobholl: how many @C ?|pg||
nt|grebrof: 9|pg||
nt|bobholl: to bid i mean :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5|pg||

nt|bobholl: not too easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe get a lucky lead? |pg||

mb|d|nt|ritong: robles will be disappointed|pg||
nt|ritong: missing an ace, no grand today|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  you can only try to mix it up and hope for the best|pg||
nt|frankaus: XX usually a Hon|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@d shows an intermediate hand at this vul i suppose|pg||
nt|psyck: will make it difficult for NS to find their @h spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have bid 3@S as west (stopper ask) :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: W might bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: but guess the colour|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3D|nt|sybarra: where do we end here? |pg||
nt|bobholl: 8 of @H is an entrie|pg||
nt|bobholl: larsson saving laura (may be temporaly)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dimi: 3NT is the right contract for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  ish has a big hand|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but his K of clubs is wasted|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and clearly their style is to enter the auction aggressively|pg||
nt|agumperz:  so i am guessing he passes|pg||
nt|frankaus: KC  - wil reveal 2 cont missing|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the 5-level would be too high if spades were 6-1|pg||
nt|psyck: only problem is you have a couple of other suits you would like stoppers in too :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this leads to same result|pg||
nt|bobholl: n 4@S east 5@D ?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|grebrof: some would dbl 5@cs, but I can understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: 3@h is only one down|pg||
nt|psyck: S did well here|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice support from arnolds :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: east did well to ty the @C finesse once more. NS lead 2nd from bad holdings / top from inner sequence, since she had the 10 and and saw 3 honors the 9 was consistant to K98... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: other finesses were also available but a bit more dangerous|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't have doubles as N (goose on a roope is a dutch expression)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfe: No defense to this one|pg||
nt|agumperz:  good judgement by Del'Monte|pg||
nt|frankaus: i hava a saying - if my g'ma had wheels - i would be a bus :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: first task for south was to find @CQ, that is solved, but then she must get two @D tricks and solve trumps without running into a @C ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this will prove no difficulty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Has to play N for Club K|pg||
nt|mcphee: certainly sensible on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  ok, can u translate that for the slower non-aussies like me?|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Laughter at the table :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzcd: Robles thinking ...|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough|pg||
nt|tez: if you open with this hand..i belive you must bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|tez: with east hand|pg||
nt|ritong: 5NT should be key check here, but need an agreement|pg||
nt|tez: agree?|pg||
nt|tez: Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he can derogate|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/3/4 @d is the strongest possible sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: so, even if opening is based on aggressivity, east must cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: imho|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it leaves blackwood door open|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: you have them where you want them to be - to protect your score|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would have shown the @c suit too with South's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, don't often find 5 trumps not show in the bidding :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcphee: can actually dble hook @C to his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: robles decided that @c A is out  makes sense|pg||
nt|tomi2: perheps she will play @SA @S towards the jack to get another entry for a @D finesse. other chance is to duck a @D and try spde finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcphee: just about anything works|pg||
nt|tomi2: that sees a fair line, needs @SK with the opening leader|pg||
nt|tomi2: but now the club might get ruffed if east continues the suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 3 from west is a tricky card, hard to read as high from doubleton :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfe: Incorrect, club 10 then wins later with out a club|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: nothing succeeds but succes  and 5@S going down also|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tomi2: from the count signal in @D east should know that there is only one @D left with south, I think its impossible to prevent that ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|bobholl: can laura(dekker) guess the @C i fear she won't now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|bobholl: as a kib remarks first Q and than a @C is lavinthal for @S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: west could have / perhaps did play a suit preferance signal in the 2nd @D trick with her remaining spotcards to help partner|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably me too |pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: low to 8:)|pg||
nt|ritong: and gets imps, when other room auction was a tad hasty|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfe: Yup, club 8 save the contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: but they are in safe contract |pg||
nt|sybarra: and not battling agst a bunch of @D bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|grebrof: well, you want to protect Ps trumps, so I dont agree with that Lavinthal|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|ritong: east now presumes that his pard has at most 2@ss|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: its past beer o'clock here - so beware of the humour|pg||

nt|bobholl: if it is a choice of contracts i don't like it |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6NT is unsafe on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a small @D west can get 2 @C ruffs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: 1 down is normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzcb: Bertheau: "You lying to me? :)"|pg||
nt|tomi2: now e ist in some trouble|pg||
nt|tomi2: trying to unblock already but that does not help so much because south has the @S t|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: and 12 imps |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by the dutch "veterans"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: oh well, i thought i was on track when they made 1 level bids 1st round, 2 level bids 2nd round...5 level 5th round...to bad they decided to save a round on bidding at the end|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: @d now|pg||
nt|tez: if he ruff..you cant lose |pg||
nt|tomi2: east should have unblocked once more|pg||
nt|bobholl: so this is good|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldjean: might become a closematch after all|pg||
nt|bobholl: poor wietske what should she play now :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the dutch in the other room also made 3nt|pg||
nt|bobholl: here they will make 4 i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: after difficult 1st segment yesterday the dutch ladies have rallied well |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall they we down like 40 after 1st segment |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|tomi2: now the spade is a winner and east is endplayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: is there any layout now for declarer to lose the contract?|pg||

nt|kingcur: sorry, didnt see the dbl, lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Cor,  yes following pard's request helped |pg||
nt|bobholl: do they play the "old faSHIONED" 2nt ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess dekkers will bid 3@H via 2nt |pg||
mb|2N|an|*|nt|mcphee: nice barrage here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 level should be the limit|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bobholl: just too little for a direct 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and it bounced them overboard|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcb: Hey Cor|pg||
nt|baldjean: E is too strong to give up|pg||

mb|3H|nt|grebrof: last hand if S have had A and AKQ (preferably in @ds) grand was possible, so it was maybe ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes you could bid 6@D after 3@D (as in open room)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will marion pass 3@H guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: agree,   |pg||
nt|kingcur: and will be happy to see W elect one of her suits|pg||

nt|bobholl: well bid and now make it but that's not too easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: Amoils gone for a smoke:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I think we would all bid @H over the 10xxxx @D suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: or some forcing bid |pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: but then we get 4 weeks annual leave and 1 weeks long service leave each year - so we will be happy with our lot|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|dimi: it can be made with a right view in @s of course|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|tomi2: @H to dummy and lead the @SJ, but that needs both defenders to be sleeping one time, no chance I would say. other way is simply to run the clubs and hope for wrong discards|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tez: he can make|pg||
nt|bobholl: trump now and 1 after overuff migth let it go down|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: one has a feeling there is a possible trump coup, yes|pg||
nt|ritong: although declarer is not aware about trump position|pg||
nt|tez: he must ruff from long side now:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hJ|nt|kingcur: meanwhile, bd 5 brought in another 8 imps for the Dutch ladies; other room in 2NT+1|pg||

nt|sbeatty:  It appears that Falk could have succeeded by winning the @CA, drawing trumps and losing a @C and 1 @D but his line is very normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Back|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of backwards in scheme of life however |pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W beered her p :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: in 3@S even more interesting :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: staying low on this deal will gain |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: now what are methods?|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s have to be a bid careful hee, |pg||
nt|sybarra: played with open cards you can probably make 6 @C |pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H EW here, slam on finesse. But S unlikely to remain silent at these colours|pg||
nt|tomi2: after 240 imps in 36 boards yesterday the dutch dealing machines produced some flat boards, so we are happy to see a @D7 instead of all those swings yesterday :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W seemed very unsure whether to alert or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: E explained it as @S+@D, W wrote something down|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play with screens, right?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Yes. W also wrote down @S+@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sbeatty:  ahhh :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dimi: 6@c works because the trumpf K is well placed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the "dutchesses" seems to be winning the "big" deals as 5@c was passed out at the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S is a profitable save |pg||
nt|sybarra: wont be S bidding it is my guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then she should bid 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|sybarra: do you want to play 6 @H or 6 @C?|pg||
nt|kingcur: was just looking at that|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is NOT match points|pg||
mb|d|nt|agumperz:  they will make a slam try on the way|pg||
nt|agumperz:  like that 3@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it a slam you want to be in?|pg||
nt|dimi: not really < 25%|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt they will bid it with K@c missing|pg||
nt|dimi: oops <50%|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 @S meant? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afraid I could never stop pard in the "boss" suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  was 1 @S alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh, I did not expect pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: I thought S would make some try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Double checked that 2S is the contract|pg||
nt|agumperz:  oops|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C probbly has more options|pg||
nt|kingcur: +a|pg||
nt|bobholl: "always" lead trumps by this kind of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sbeatty:  I am a little surprised that South both opened and rebid with his hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: thats better|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told it means 3 or fewer spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cor re 6 @C |pg||
nt|tomi2: south could double. it needs a very bad day to see 10 tricks but it might well be down for 500 or 800 or more|pg||
nt|bobholl: but KIng would have been better :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: bridge is kinda weired as I find N to have a better hand than S|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is the @D switch needed again |pg||
nt|bobholl: wow now lead @D after 2@S but @C finesse will save ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  4@S is RKC i take it|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe not LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4S=KC|pg||
nt|tomi2: she has very decent trumps, an ace and partner might have something as well|pg||
pc|hK|nt|swanson:  The question here is: can declare arrange seven tricks before the defense gets their seve.|pg||
nt|swanson:  seven|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done by laura (i wouldn't have :))|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: @h7, maybe|pg||
nt|tez: or 9|pg||
nt|grebrof: still S is opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry no difference between small and K @H|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, "better" is a matter of speach|pg||
pc|h2|nt|agumperz:  now we get to see if they remember their methods|pg||
nt|tez: i bet he will lead t of @c |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I didn't notice it hadn't registered, sorry|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be down|pg||
nt|dimi: after @h lead of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be another chance for Dutch ladies?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: well whatever the system,  they seemed to have missed a an 8 card and a 9 card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: and give credit to n/s,  didnt push |pg||
nt|baldjean: thiis may be another chance for the Dutch team to catch up|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kingcur: not made up my mind yet if I'd want to be a slam here. How about you, Jean?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: carla thinks if they fear a @S ruff may be no @H finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  So declarer's plan od to establish a spade for the 7th trcik ...|pg||
nt|frankaus: nned to get @D right - odds againts it IMO|pg||
nt|agumperz:  NS got a little high|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|tez: i wrote to late:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzcb: *Pasman|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|agumperz:  when partner has shown a red 2-suiter|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|swanson:  The defenders simply don't have anywhere to find enough tricks.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|agumperz:  perhaps its not a great idea to cue the KQ of spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: Dahl will show him AK @C  then 1s A |pg||
nt|frankaus: @Sa|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|tomi2: the 3@H opening put some pressure on EW, I agree to their bidding. both players were hoping for a bit better cards in partners hand but they could not find out|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: now  !1d Q placed with W|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: jet (pasman) guessed wrong |pg||
nt|bobholl: but to profit bertheau should play @H now and that is surely not obvious|pg||
nt|grebrof: sorry, but I have to log off - hopefully be back later - enjoy the show!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobholl: so this is a push|pg||

nt|frankaus: singing getting louder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I think Simons just said she thought 3@D asked for a @D stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pasman and Simons are now the "Senior" pair on the Dutch team   we had a retirement right Bas?|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla's trick worked perfectly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||
nt|sybarra: period of reorganization then for Neth. Ladies team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Her partner, Carla Arnolds, is now playing with another well-known player, Wietske van Zwol. They are currently playing here as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can not be but so far behind now |pg||
nt|baldjean: was just typing the same, Shirley. the match may become very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier to bd in slam with seeing all the cards |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson:  East has a shot a 11 tricks in diamonds here.  |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2 more for Holland on bd 6, the other room in 3@S, making the same number of tricks, so 2 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent the Dutch ladies about 40 behind after 1st segment?|pg||
nt|tomi2: double digit swings are back. Sweden found the best contract (5@C) on the hand where 3NT had no play, but 4@Sx-2 was 12 back|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C or 4@H not that easy if ns stay silent|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|swanson:  If the defenders help clear spades and South fails to drop the @CQ under the ace, he can be endplay for a sluff and ruff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  bessis probably reasoned that with Axxx, xxx, x, AKJxx that dahl would have bid|pg||
nt|agumperz:  while with the actual hand he would not|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H missing 2 cashing aces is going to bring swings - sadly out not in|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the case of the dog that did not sing in the night|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is useful to inquire futher|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@d seems to be a nice contract|pg||
nt|baldjean: Cor, with the Dutch team being so fat behind at tge start of this session they will probably go for any possible slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they stay low ?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|mcphee: what happened to board 40?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck here for amoils|pg||
nt|sybarra: our pards do the same,  bid our voids,  (or is it just me?)|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 sure tricks in NT trade for 8 unsure tricks in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: now just need 4th from longest and strongest lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: qed :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson:  I don't see Bianchedi sitting for this.  Partner needs a spade stopper and teh @DA.|pg||
nt|ritong: even if opener has 4@hs, they will be useful in a @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry tired|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not particularly scared about getting trumpshortened here|pg||
nt|sybarra: in this case it is 5th |pg||
mb|3D|nt|agumperz:  NP|pg||
nt|agumperz:  you have had a hard day's work!|pg||
nt|bobholl: the cards are not nice located for NS |pg||
nt|bobholl: if they pass now they migth make|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: we say ....... no worries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The screen sometimes becomes embedded in the mind :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say 8 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: oops, computer being a bit slow here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a rather unpleasant distribution  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt makes even if misguess in @D (@H 44)|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: this bidding screams for a trump lead but with Qxx difficult|pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson:  I don't know what 4@S implies but West should hae been putting on the brakes.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson:  Now the endplay is for down one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@s explained as "cuebid"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  West's bidding is a little too agressive |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now some bickering|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead req by Friedland|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange on system card it says 135|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|agumperz:  will dahl divine the non spade lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: @h lead actually best :)|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|frankaus: luck 4-3 @s layout|pg||

nt|sbeatty:  If EW arrive in 5D in other room this board may be a push...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: other table has gone on break; we're going to get pretty far ahead|pg||
nt|frankaus: T1 decision - we have all got that wrong i'm sure|pg||
nt|tez: woww|pg||
nt|tez: 7@h|pg||
nt|tez: not easy to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd Laura |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H is on but difficult to bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: nicely played for a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|agumperz:  still playing the spade jack from dummy was an exceedingly odd play|pg||
nt|kingcur: pretty line of play too, not dependant of the lay-out in @cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|tez: 33 nice  points|pg||
nt|ritong: two key cards have to be discovered|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow carla is not afraid|pg||
nt|bobholl: transfer response|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: @d Q and @s K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have just been told very sad news,  Lea Dupont passed away 3 hours ago....she was Garozzo's partner for so many years |pg||
mb|1H!|nt|tez: dbl is helps|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D probably promises an unbalanced hand since they opened 1@C on a balanced one with KQxxx@D before|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if wietske (van zwol) now supports @H they migth get @D lead|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not just bridge partner |pg||
nt|kingcur: that's very sad news indeed :( may she rest in peace|pg||
mb|2S|nt|agumperz:  so he played the spade jack to lure friedland into winning the first spade from a holding of AKxxx|pg||
nt|baldjean: sorry to hear that. very sad, especially for Benito Garozzo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Very sad news indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: t os @S or a small @C what would you lead shirley ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now does she lead her singleton?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: straightforward, eh?|pg||
nt|tez: 4 nt is quantitative in my opinion|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla worth 5@C ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i doubt it|pg||
nt|bobholl: laura hasn't got enough for 2@S imo|pg||
mb|r!|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards even 6@H is on with @H 22|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess they play 2nt here as lebensohl that explains the 4@H bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
nt|mouser:  I agree. He dug himself a hole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: North confirms they play Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ritong: in a lot of people' opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: sign me in|pg||
nt|tez: last here..ty all enjoyed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 imp to the dutch :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead my singleton |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 5 @D making 6 no less |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: W will duck with AKxxx 4 sure|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he should|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but Bessis was thinking|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he just failed to sider this possibility|pg||
nt|agumperz:  consider|pg||
mb|d|nt|kingcur: And likely unaware of this sad news, NS are meanwhile on their way to another gain for Holland, staying low in 2@S with other table down in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was looking and only -1 in game is quite good |pg||
nt|bobholl: nice gain for the dutch (again) |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 9 imps but 10 is possible (ruff @C free and make 6)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ty Henri ty Paula|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcd: ty |pg||
nt|tez: byees|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: making should be easier than declaring it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes, she claimed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: debiera cumplir perdiendo 2@d+2@s|pg||
nt|rijase: jugara contra los 18 de paca, pero no parece que tenga problemas para cumplir la mano|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: descartando el @h perdedor en el @c|pg||
nt|baldjean: Important 9@c with N here. excgange it with the 6@c of E, and it makes a lot of difference|pg||
nt|kingcur: and bd 9 another 13 for Holland....wow|pg||
nt|kingcur: Pasman-Simons in the club slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: using old theory,  if you dont lead it you dont have it |pg||
nt|bobholl: costing 500 or so against nothing|pg||
nt|bobholl: and i guess 500 is optimistic :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: touted off of a ht lead at this table with the hts being in E hand |pg||
nt|baldjean: exchange*|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am looking do n/s still have time to beat it?|pg||
nt|tomi2: east regrets not having bid 3nt, that would save lots of time|pg||
nt|bobholl: Q or small @H ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rijase: claro|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what % play is, she might lead small to the ace and back  but no |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: when do we restart Bas  (I know we have one more hand |pg||
nt|bobholl: she starts well :) for making 6 |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: but i guess she will cross with @D ruffs so not making 6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|cT|nt|swanson:  The location of the @CK is a big disappointment for declarer.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mouser:  It is going to be ugly|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: well done by the swedish ladies 3@H C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: another pick up here|pg||
nt|agumperz:  it is easy to judge a play that fails harshly in the moment. Better to think about why it happened.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: east is making very very unhappy noises|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: 4PM local|pg||
pc|s9|nt|agumperz:  11 tricks and 8 IMPs to Falk|pg||
nt|agumperz:  giving them 5 boards to regain 73 IMPs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  where is that lady Frank?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: 20 min or so |pg||
nt|sybarra: (I think) |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Peter is an excellent player and very competitive he hates to lose a trick, even a meaningless overtrick.|pg||

nt|kingcur: and this might not be a minus result for the Dutch either|pg||
nt|bobholl: good result ew in other room (5@H on ns)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: vulnarable Partner bids 4@H so ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult colors for S to balance and 4333 also |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt pass double what is best ?:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S would have cost "only" 800 i guess|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mouser:  this one looks pretty flat for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|swanson:  The term for the 4@S sacrafice around here is 'air ball' - it goes down more than the value of a game which isn't making.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: joaquin getting cheeky:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: dutch ladies need to regroup now |pg||
nt|bobholl: the AK lead will cost a trick i guess|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|agumperz:  This match has been an excellent performance by the Amoils team|pg||
nt|kingcur: S looking at a 15 count, but it looks like Emmenthal cheese, it lacks shape and she has a 1NT opener behind her, making it very dangerous to bid at these colours|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H or pass always a (difficult) guess|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rijase: Rafa, ganan algún clasificatorio por esta copa?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D two way drury?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|agumperz:  to end the Cinderella run of the Falk team|pg||
pc|hA|nt|agumperz:  The Falk team played extremely well until this match|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and deserved to be here|pg||
nt|agumperz:  my guess is that playing 4 handed finally caught up with them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The Falk team was outstanding!|pg||
nt|baldjean: I thought you might have used another nautic metaphor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I tried "righting the ship" |pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzcd: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: es el torneo de equipos más antiguo del Club de Bridge Santiago|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: y el más importante|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: could not think of another one |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: They're making water :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: how about "changing course"?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works!! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Hoist all the sails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works also Bas |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mouser:  not opening 2 spades by north is too sound for me|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: now N likes her partner for her pass on 4@H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tomi2: creative lead by south, good partner was awake/aware and did not try the discovery play of @CT|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: north had a difficult bid|pg||
nt|baldjean: or "damn the torpedos and full sped ahead"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: It appears I am lying, next broadcast will start in 25 minutes :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sbeatty:  Looks like 6H 3C and a S or ruff for a make|pg||
nt|kingcur: In the Open room, W opened 1@C and E bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: making it slightly less dangerous for S to bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
