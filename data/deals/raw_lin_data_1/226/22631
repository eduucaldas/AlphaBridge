mb|1C!|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||

nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not i|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: personally I would be tempted, if we were playing a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multiple flaws:  not a high offense-to-defense ratio, most HCP outside my suit, 4 spades onn the side and an exceptionally good dummy for spades at that, ace of my suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there are a lot of reasons why perhaps you shouldn't - 4@s, lots of cards outside|pg||

nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  so he played the spade jack to lure friedland into winning the first spade from a holding of AKxxx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: straightforward, eh?|pg||
nt|tez: 4 nt is quantitative in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
nt|mouser:  I agree. He dug himself a hole|pg||

nt|marlowepi: X is a transfer to spades, and 1S would be a transfer too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: playing that, you can play 1@S as saying "bid 1NT with 12-14", or you can use 1@s to show values but without four or more spades|pg||
