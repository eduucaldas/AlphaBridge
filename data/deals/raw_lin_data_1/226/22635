nt|sbeatty:  It appears that Falk could have succeeded by winning the @CA, drawing trumps and losing a @C and 1 @D but his line is very normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Back|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of backwards in scheme of life however |pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: now what are methods?|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s have to be a bid careful hee, |pg||
nt|sybarra: played with open cards you can probably make 6 @C |pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H EW here, slam on finesse. But S unlikely to remain silent at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|sbeatty:  ahhh :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dimi: 6@c works because the trumpf K is well placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@H ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: do you want to play 6 @H or 6 @C?|pg||
nt|kingcur: was just looking at that|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is NOT match points|pg||
mb|3H|nt|agumperz:  they will make a slam try on the way|pg||
nt|agumperz:  like that 3@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it a slam you want to be in?|pg||
nt|dimi: not really < 25%|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt they will bid it with K@c missing|pg||
nt|dimi: oops <50%|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 @S meant? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afraid I could never stop pard in the "boss" suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  was 1 @S alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh, I did not expect pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: I thought S would make some try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Double checked that 2S is the contract|pg||
nt|agumperz:  oops|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C probbly has more options|pg||
nt|kingcur: +a|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sbeatty:  I am a little surprised that South both opened and rebid with his hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: thats better|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told it means 3 or fewer spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cor re 6 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  4@S is RKC i take it|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe not LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4S=KC|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  The question here is: can declare arrange seven tricks before the defense gets their seve.|pg||
nt|swanson:  seven|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: @h7, maybe|pg||
nt|tez: or 9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|agumperz:  now we get to see if they remember their methods|pg||
nt|tez: i bet he will lead t of @c |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I didn't notice it hadn't registered, sorry|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be down|pg||
nt|dimi: after @h lead of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be another chance for Dutch ladies?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: well whatever the system,  they seemed to have missed a an 8 card and a 9 card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: and give credit to n/s,  didnt push |pg||
nt|baldjean: thiis may be another chance for the Dutch team to catch up|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kingcur: not made up my mind yet if I'd want to be a slam here. How about you, Jean?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: carla thinks if they fear a @S ruff may be no @H finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sbeatty:  So declarer's plan od to establish a spade for the 7th trcik ...|pg||

nt|swanson:  The defenders simply don't have anywhere to find enough tricks.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|agumperz:  perhaps its not a great idea to cue the KQ of spades|pg||

nt|frankaus: singing getting louder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I think Simons just said she thought 3@D asked for a @D stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pasman and Simons are now the "Senior" pair on the Dutch team   we had a retirement right Bas?|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla's trick worked perfectly :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||
nt|sybarra: period of reorganization then for Neth. Ladies team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Her partner, Carla Arnolds, is now playing with another well-known player, Wietske van Zwol. They are currently playing here as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can not be but so far behind now |pg||
nt|baldjean: was just typing the same, Shirley. the match may become very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier to bd in slam with seeing all the cards |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|swanson:  East has a shot a 11 tricks in diamonds here.  |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2 more for Holland on bd 6, the other room in 3@S, making the same number of tricks, so 2 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent the Dutch ladies about 40 behind after 1st segment?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson:  If the defenders help clear spades and South fails to drop the @CQ under the ace, he can be endplay for a sluff and ruff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  bessis probably reasoned that with Axxx, xxx, x, AKJxx that dahl would have bid|pg||
nt|agumperz:  while with the actual hand he would not|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H missing 2 cashing aces is going to bring swings - sadly out not in|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the case of the dog that did not sing in the night|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is useful to inquire futher|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@d seems to be a nice contract|pg||
nt|baldjean: Cor, with the Dutch team being so fat behind at tge start of this session they will probably go for any possible slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: what happened to board 40?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck here for amoils|pg||
nt|sybarra: our pards do the same,  bid our voids,  (or is it just me?)|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 sure tricks in NT trade for 8 unsure tricks in @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson:  I don't see Bianchedi sitting for this.  Partner needs a spade stopper and teh @DA.|pg||
nt|ritong: even if opener has 4@hs, they will be useful in a @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry tired|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not particularly scared about getting trumpshortened here|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  NP|pg||
nt|agumperz:  you have had a hard day's work!|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: we say ....... no worries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The screen sometimes becomes embedded in the mind :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say 8 ?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|baldjean: oops, computer being a bit slow here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a rather unpleasant distribution  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|swanson:  I don't know what 4@S implies but West should hae been putting on the brakes.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|swanson:  Now the endplay is for down one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@s explained as "cuebid"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  West's bidding is a little too agressive |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now some bickering|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead req by Friedland|pg||
pc|d3|nt|agumperz:  will dahl divine the non spade lead?|pg||

nt|ritong: two key cards have to be discovered|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: @d Q and @s K|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: dbl is helps|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
mb|3S|an|*|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if wietske (van zwol) now supports @H they migth get @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not just bridge partner |pg||
nt|kingcur: that's very sad news indeed :( may she rest in peace|pg||
mb|4H|nt|agumperz:  so he played the spade jack to lure friedland into winning the first spade from a holding of AKxxx|pg||
nt|baldjean: sorry to hear that. very sad, especially for Benito Garozzo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Very sad news indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: straightforward, eh?|pg||
nt|tez: 4 nt is quantitative in my opinion|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla worth 5@C ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
nt|mouser:  I agree. He dug himself a hole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: North confirms they play Rusinow leads|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|an|3+|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: rehi, everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|kingcur: The other room featuring Carla Arnolds, who partnered up with Wietske van Zwol after her partner of many years Bep Vriend decided to retire from international bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@d doesn't have to be a suit, so 2@d can be natural here |pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: la diferencia es de 33 con 5 manos por comparar|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: perdón, 5 por jugar en esta sala, 7 por comparar, en la sala abierta están jugando la 26|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last now,  thx Bas for great job as always |pg||
nt|kingcur: and another 6|pg||
nt|kingcur: and this might not be a minus result for the Dutch either|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: My pleasure :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mouser:  this one looks pretty flat for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|swanson:  The term for the 4@S sacrafice around here is 'air ball' - it goes down more than the value of a game which isn't making.|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Dimitri and Jeanine   |pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: the session was clearly dominated by a good Swedish team, thx all cu later|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to specs for all of the comments and system help |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: joaquin getting cheeky:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: dutch ladies need to regroup now |pg||
mb|2D!|an|Puppet to 2!H|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  This match has been an excellent performance by the Amoils team|pg||
nt|kingcur: S looking at a 15 count, but it looks like Emmenthal cheese, it lacks shape and she has a 1NT opener behind her, making it very dangerous to bid at these colours|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H or pass always a (difficult) guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rijase: Rafa, ganan algún clasificatorio por esta copa?|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  to end the Cinderella run of the Falk team|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  The Falk team played extremely well until this match|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and deserved to be here|pg||
nt|agumperz:  my guess is that playing 4 handed finally caught up with them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The Falk team was outstanding!|pg||
nt|baldjean: I thought you might have used another nautic metaphor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I tried "righting the ship" |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcd: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: es el torneo de equipos más antiguo del Club de Bridge Santiago|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: y el más importante|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: could not think of another one |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: They're making water :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: how about "changing course"?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works!! |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Hoist all the sails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: THAT works also Bas |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mouser:  not opening 2 spades by north is too sound for me|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ritong: north had a difficult bid|pg||
nt|baldjean: or "damn the torpedos and full sped ahead"|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Looks like 6H 3C and a S or ruff for a make|pg||
nt|kingcur: In the Open room, W opened 1@C and E bid 1NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: making it slightly less dangerous for S to bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kingcur: N elected to pass the dbl, probably in an attempt to control damage|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|agumperz:  they should be very proud of themselves for their performance in this event|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: flat distribution, not so useful values in opponents suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: now the @D losers disappears :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|swanson:  Does look routine, but East would bid 3@H and get raised, so it wouldn't affect the outcome.|pg||
nt|swanson:  There was an unexpected contract on 58 at the other table.  3@C!.|pg||
nt|swanson:  But sound enough.|pg||
nt|ritong: the tactical opening worked like a charm|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: nice gain for the dutch|pg||
