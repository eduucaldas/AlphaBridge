nt|vugrapha4: Harper have left themselves a huge task in these 16 boards|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they need over 4 imps per board|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: 4@s can be defeated|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: a chance for 11 to harper|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: tricky game hand here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: assuming you lose to @HK, you have to combine your spade losses to 2 tricks ... there are 3 ways of doing this|pg||
nt|nigel: Delmonte and Burgess are playing Moscito without relays|pg||
nt|beauch:  good natural bidders dont need a big club system- relays in my view great for poor standard bidders!!|pg||
nt|joegrue: ahh i c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: East has @S10,West has @S10, East has @DK|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But perhaps the best line is to not lose to @HK|pg||
nt|joegrue: as long as they realize that|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: in other words, you could cash @HA, and then hope to endplay someone with @HK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: Eliminate clubs, @DA, @Druff, @HA, and then a heart|pg||
nt|beauch:  4 flat bds then high run-rate to get!|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 6@C or 6@H - not sure which|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Some people play that 1 4NT opening asks for specific aces|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6@C?|pg||
nt|shinge: They're hardly likely to find a save now !!|pg||
nt|hoffers: Yes - 6@h looks a good bet now|pg||
nt|jlall: 6H will be down on a club ruff if they figure it out, but he might try to cash AK of spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@C :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 6@c isnt enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: ow|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: needed to play 6@h|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: although a @c lead does shoot it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure Michael misclaimed on one board :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: which one?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: in any case, BBO scoring is unofficial|pg||
nt|Walddk2: kidding|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|shinge: we're looking for a tie - find some imps !!|pg||
mc|12|nt|jlall: I know ish is often said to never resign with 1 set to go, not that he would with this margin, but this shows why he is right|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jrf: The way the play went, 4Sx in the other room could have been made - but declarer played for CKQ offside.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joegrue: 4c opener says pdr please bid 3nt! :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|beauch:  another possible swing hand for harper team|pg||

mc|9|nt|bjacobs: actually, I am wrong, the par result is 6@D doubled|pg||
nt|beauch:  difference 16imps now - hard to call now|pg||
nt|beauch:  might be decided on bd 32 in other vroom|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 14 imps is the margin, so in the other room e-w need to bid and make 6H to tie the match - 6C is not enough!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: almost the miracle comeback|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: great finish - i dare say the  brown team needs a stiff drink after that|pg||
