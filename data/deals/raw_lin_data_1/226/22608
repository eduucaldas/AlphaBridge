nt|bjacobs: 6@C or 6@H - not sure which|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|newart:  still should be - a very useful bid the 2NT F|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The problem is, she won't have the methods to find out about the @CQ and @SA, so why bother|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Some people play that 1 4NT opening asks for specific aces|pg||
