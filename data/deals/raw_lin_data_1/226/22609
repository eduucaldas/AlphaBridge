nt|newart:  not on this hand but just a general principle - ie 2NT GF|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: West asked to be excused to go to the toilet. Liz Havas asked her to take her bladder as well. If only she knew what partner's hand was she really would want to go to the bathroom|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: The point is this:  there is pretty much no hand you can construct for West that doesn't have a play for slam|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: West will have some cards in your suit, because she has <4 spades, and after 3@C, less than 7@D|pg||

nt|bjacobs: So she has saved an imp by making all 13 tricks but the match is out the window|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: I think most old school rubber bridge players would open 6@H on this hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's not the worst bid in the world|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Or 4NT for specific aces would be OK too|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Some people play that 1 4NT opening asks for specific aces|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem with 4NT is that @SA is not really enough ... |pg||
nt|bjacobs: only some full-on relay system can solve hands like that|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugrapha2: I think if you play a diamond off dummy first you may make this hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West might consider 3NT assuming East reveals diamonds|pg||
