mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or the wrong hand is discarding |pg||

nt|Vugraphzcb: Bertheau|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mcphee: 3@C? 3@S? whats his choice?|pg||
nt|sybarra: first "blood" to Sweden,  only in 4 @S in the other room on bd 2 |pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: whoa|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will work out ok|pg||
nt|tez: do you open with N hand?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I am being told 2@h shows 11-13. but then I don't understand why E passed 3nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: kib suggests to cash the @D ace to see a signal/dummy, but this would not work since if spade was right you might well need @DA as an entry for the 2nd ruff. two aces and only one ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: ruff is not enough to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S 2nt 3@D i guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: bad guesser as usual|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: n/s doing what they can to create havoc|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Apparently supporting hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: matter of style if you open 3 @H on the E hand |pg||
nt|baldjean: this 3@h does of course not impress S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: 3@C seems a better choice to me|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many will X with N's hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like multi withthe strong included |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: or 4441? |pg||
mb|3D|nt|mcphee: nice ending|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: any thought that X might have been first bid? |pg||
nt|sybarra: from S ?|pg||
nt|psyck: @h's too weak to pass, maybe 1N now|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N makes as cards lay|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another slam?|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is some silent bidding. EW have opening + 11hcp and this good club fit and let opps play 2@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think east hand was worth another bid, maybe a double on 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so e/w passed up 1400 to defend 4@S dbled to get the extra 30:)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  friedland's 2@H is slightly aggressive|pg||

nt|ballebodk: a tough defense to find but let us see if she find the right @h play|pg||
nt|athene: now ace and duck a trump, and then if north plays the @D7, you just ruff in hand small, and if north overruffs, you overruff in turn in dummy|pg||

nt|grebrof: its maybe "easier" if E starts with 2@s|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: but it is charming|pg||
nt|tomi2: south decided not to open this hand vulnerable, since her opening does not imply a club suit.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzcb: EW discussing now|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be down a bunch if timed right |pg||

nt|baldjean: metaphor*|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|sybarra: think you got the "drift"  of it |pg||

nt|tomi2: K&R (xxx AQx Qx K98xx) = 10.20 - K/R agrees|pg||

nt|bobholl: in @H you have an extra trick|pg||

nt|psyck: S did well here|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice support from arnolds :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: east did well to ty the @C finesse once more. NS lead 2nd from bad holdings / top from inner sequence, since she had the 10 and and saw 3 honors the 9 was consistant to K98... ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: other finesses were also available but a bit more dangerous|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't have doubles as N (goose on a roope is a dutch expression)|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

nt|tez: agree?|pg||
nt|tez: Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think he can derogate|pg||
nt|ritong: 2/3/4 @d is the strongest possible sequence|pg||

nt|ritong: imho|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it leaves blackwood door open|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mcphee: can actually dble hook @C to his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: robles decided that @c A is out  makes sense|pg||
nt|tomi2: perheps she will play @SA @S towards the jack to get another entry for a @D finesse. other chance is to duck a @D and try spde finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: just about anything works|pg||
nt|tomi2: that sees a fair line, needs @SK with the opening leader|pg||
nt|tomi2: but now the club might get ruffed if east continues the suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 3 from west is a tricky card, hard to read as high from doubleton :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfe: Incorrect, club 10 then wins later with out a club|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bobholl: nothing succeeds but succes  and 5@S going down also|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: from the count signal in @D east should know that there is only one @D left with south, I think its impossible to prevent that ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: as a kib remarks first Q and than a @C is lavinthal for @S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tomi2: west could have / perhaps did play a suit preferance signal in the 2nd @D trick with her remaining spotcards to help partner|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: probably me too |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: low to 8:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west may now find the spade lead perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: against 6nt usually you lead safe|pg||
nt|athene: but if you know dummy has a long suit - might be time to be agressive|pg||
nt|athene: aggressive even|pg||
nt|tomi2: of course spade might backfire badly, difficult|pg||

nt|athene: not much interest now, just finesse @DQ for overtrick|pg||
mc|12|nt|tomi2: heart would be my last choice|pg||
nt|athene: most people play that opener can only super-accept the minor transfer with a top honour, so north knew her partner would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: so you might say, why not just bid 4nt?|pg||
nt|tomi2: partner might have 3 or 4 small clubs and a doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess she wanted to show long clubs because her partner could offer 6@C with, say, @cxxx or @Cxxxx|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 3 Simons Pasman  IN slam this time |pg||
nt|grebrof: a low @c might have given declarer a way to throw a loser in another suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 down so nic e profit for a X i wouldn't have done :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: aaak, ok the Q at trick 1 :S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: drove to the grand in @H at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s should be avoidable here|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  i see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Low spade lead on last hand?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  you have to be patient with us yanks, we are slow on the uptake :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but first T of @C and than ace is a possibillity :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: therefore declarer made a mistake not playing the K|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 2NT = invitational or GF but no SI with @H fit|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|tez: 1@d 1@s 1NT 2@S all pass|pg||
nt|ritong: east now presumes that his pard has at most 2@ss|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@H would have shown a minimum hand with no 3@C bid and their appraoch is to bid "system on" if they have no other agreement|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sybarra: I am a 3 @D bidder |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: its past beer o'clock here - so beware of the humour|pg||
nt|agumperz:  a low spade lead might have worked, but leading away from an ace into the doubler when pard might have a stiff spade?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope for the best |pg||
nt|sybarra: X probably means "lead spade" pard |pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@C is on with a normal guess in @D|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcphee: this one is going down with the 4/s@S fit a make|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is a sequence to discuss with your regular partner. does such free 3@H bids show extras / extra shape? is pass forcing? do you allow them to play 3 clubs even when you were ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: forced to play 3@H with no intervention?...|pg||

mb|p|nt|agumperz:  unfortunately 6@C is cold|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|bobholl: now 4@S and 6@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are many situations where you know or "know" P will ruff and Lavinthal is not possible because you have to play that(!) card |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcd: E pregunta a N si 3ST era forcing :)|pg||
nt|rijase: parece un seguro pequeño slam aca... perdiendo 1@d solamente|pg||

mb|4N!|nt|sybarra: that was the XX hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: a sad result for them for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: already|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  6@H too.|pg||
nt|tomi2: that 3@C bid vuln was not based on a sooo good suit, that could backfire. sometimes she could get doubled for a lot, this time her partner lead the suit but it was not the best ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: lead. east could stand any natural lead from partner, esp. @D|pg||
nt|tomi2: if partner was going to lead from qxx(x) instead 3@C would make her change the decision|pg||
nt|grebrof: I like this too! 1nt-2nt as invitational is boring|pg||
mb|5N|nt|frankaus: do i hear singing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: E-W discussion|pg||
nt|agumperz:  a certain fat lady?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: lookng for 7?|pg||
nt|bobholl: even a grand slam try :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if it is a choice of contracts i don't like it |pg||
nt|bobholl: 6NT is unsafe on a @S lead|pg||
mb|6C|nt|tez: 1 down is normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcb: Bertheau: "You lying to me? :)"|pg||
nt|tomi2: now e ist in some trouble|pg||
nt|tomi2: trying to unblock already but that does not help so much because south has the @S t|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 12 imps |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: well done by the dutch "veterans"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck: oh well, i thought i was on track when they made 1 level bids 1st round, 2 level bids 2nd round...5 level 5th round...to bad they decided to save a round on bidding at the end|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: @d now|pg||

nt|tomi2: is there any layout now for declarer to lose the contract?|pg||

nt|tomi2: spade lead would have made the deal interesting, no finesse was working but west would have been squeezed badly if the spade lead was ducked|pg||
nt|athene: well she is sitting over both red suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: x= 4+@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if her had was too bad she should not open|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess declarer could have made it by winning the first spade and just running all the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and west gets strip squeezed in the red suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: but declarer would only do that if she could see all the cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|athene: frozen clubs|pg||

nt|athene: so declarer should be able to make this, although of course the defence may put her to the guess in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: (if anyone has not heard of the term 'frozen suit', it means a suit like the clubs here, where neither side can lead it without giving up a trick)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: @H to dummy and lead the @SJ, but that needs both defenders to be sleeping one time, no chance I would say. other way is simply to run the clubs and hope for wrong discards|pg||

nt|sybarra: sort of backwards in scheme of life however |pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W beered her p :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: in 3@S even more interesting :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: staying low on this deal will gain |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: now what are methods?|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s have to be a bid careful hee, |pg||
nt|sybarra: played with open cards you can probably make 6 @C |pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@H EW here, slam on finesse. But S unlikely to remain silent at these colours|pg||
nt|tomi2: after 240 imps in 36 boards yesterday the dutch dealing machines produced some flat boards, so we are happy to see a @D7 instead of all those swings yesterday :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: W seemed very unsure whether to alert or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: E explained it as @S+@D, W wrote something down|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play with screens, right?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Yes. W also wrote down @S+@D|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sbeatty:  ahhh :)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Majors|nt|dimi: 6@c works because the trumpf K is well placed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the "dutchesses" seems to be winning the "big" deals as 5@c was passed out at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|tomi2: then she should bid 4@S now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: do you want to play 6 @H or 6 @C?|pg||
nt|kingcur: was just looking at that|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is NOT match points|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  they will make a slam try on the way|pg||
nt|agumperz:  like that 3@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it a slam you want to be in?|pg||
nt|dimi: not really < 25%|pg||
nt|baldjean: I doubt they will bid it with K@c missing|pg||
nt|dimi: oops <50%|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 @S meant? |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be afraid I could never stop pard in the "boss" suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  was 1 @S alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh, I did not expect pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: I thought S would make some try|pg||

nt|agumperz:  oops|pg||
nt|kingcur: 6@C probbly has more options|pg||
nt|kingcur: +a|pg||
nt|bobholl: "always" lead trumps by this kind of bidding|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sbeatty:  I am a little surprised that South both opened and rebid with his hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: thats better|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told it means 3 or fewer spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cor re 6 @C |pg||
nt|tomi2: south could double. it needs a very bad day to see 10 tricks but it might well be down for 500 or 800 or more|pg||
nt|bobholl: but KIng would have been better :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: bridge is kinda weired as I find N to have a better hand than S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|agumperz:  4@S is RKC i take it|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: 4S=KC|pg||
nt|tomi2: she has very decent trumps, an ace and partner might have something as well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson:  The question here is: can declare arrange seven tricks before the defense gets their seve.|pg||

nt|tez: or 9|pg||

nt|grebrof: well, "better" is a matter of speach|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: well whatever the system,  they seemed to have missed a an 8 card and a 9 card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: and give credit to n/s,  didnt push |pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|frankaus: singing getting louder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: I think Simons just said she thought 3@D asked for a @D stop|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pasman and Simons are now the "Senior" pair on the Dutch team   we had a retirement right Bas?|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla's trick worked perfectly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzcb: Yup, unfortunately Bep Vriend, a veteran for many years, has left the ladies squad|pg||
nt|sybarra: period of reorganization then for Neth. Ladies team |pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Her partner, Carla Arnolds, is now playing with another well-known player, Wietske van Zwol. They are currently playing here as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can not be but so far behind now |pg||
nt|baldjean: was just typing the same, Shirley. the match may become very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier to bd in slam with seeing all the cards |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|swanson:  East has a shot a 11 tricks in diamonds here.  |pg||
nt|kingcur: 2 more for Holland on bd 6, the other room in 3@S, making the same number of tricks, so 2 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: werent the Dutch ladies about 40 behind after 1st segment?|pg||
nt|tomi2: double digit swings are back. Sweden found the best contract (5@C) on the hand where 3NT had no play, but 4@Sx-2 was 12 back|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson:  If the defenders help clear spades and South fails to drop the @CQ under the ace, he can be endplay for a sluff and ruff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  bessis probably reasoned that with Axxx, xxx, x, AKJxx that dahl would have bid|pg||
nt|agumperz:  while with the actual hand he would not|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@H missing 2 cashing aces is going to bring swings - sadly out not in|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the case of the dog that did not sing in the night|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is useful to inquire futher|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@d seems to be a nice contract|pg||
nt|baldjean: Cor, with the Dutch team being so fat behind at tge start of this session they will probably go for any possible slam|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mcphee: what happened to board 40?|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard luck here for amoils|pg||
nt|sybarra: our pards do the same,  bid our voids,  (or is it just me?)|pg||
nt|baldjean: far, not fat*|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 sure tricks in NT trade for 8 unsure tricks in @S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|swanson:  I don't see Bianchedi sitting for this.  Partner needs a spade stopper and teh @DA.|pg||
nt|ritong: even if opener has 4@hs, they will be useful in a @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  ahhh|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry tired|pg||
nt|ritong: west is not particularly scared about getting trumpshortened here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|agumperz:  NP|pg||
nt|agumperz:  you have had a hard day's work!|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: we say ....... no worries|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The screen sometimes becomes embedded in the mind :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 4 handed u get a rest when pd declares ...... but as the opertator ......... U  need to concentrate on every card|pg||
nt|agumperz:  without a spade lead NS would have to struggle for 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: did i say 8 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: oops, computer being a bit slow here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is a rather unpleasant distribution  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: but 6@d is down - but 4@h will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt makes even if misguess in @D (@H 44)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson:  I don't know what 4@S implies but West should hae been putting on the brakes.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|swanson:  Now the endplay is for down one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4@s explained as "cuebid"|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  West's bidding is a little too agressive |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now some bickering|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead req by Friedland|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange on system card it says 135|pg||
pc|hA|nt|agumperz:  will dahl divine the non spade lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: @h lead actually best :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: seems to make |pg||
nt|kingcur: trump lay-out is nasty, but the rest doesn't look desperate|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: luck 4-3 @s layout|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mouser:  Hi everyone|pg||

nt|tez: woww|pg||
nt|tez: 7@h|pg||
nt|tez: not easy to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd Laura |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H is on but difficult to bid |pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|agumperz:  still playing the spade jack from dummy was an exceedingly odd play|pg||
nt|kingcur: pretty line of play too, not dependant of the lay-out in @cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|tez: 33 nice  points|pg||
nt|ritong: two key cards have to be discovered|pg||
mb|2S|an|*|nt|ritong: @d Q and @s K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have just been told very sad news,  Lea Dupont passed away 3 hours ago....she was Garozzo's partner for so many years |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: dbl is helps|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response by E |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D probably promises an unbalanced hand since they opened 1@C on a balanced one with KQxxx@D before|pg||
mb|3H|nt|swanson:  4@H is a reasonable contract for NS here.  Obviously, there is a bit of a problem with the heart split.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  the spade ten looked like top of a doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if wietske (van zwol) now supports @H they migth get @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mouser:  East couldnt stand it|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and he feared that friedland would duck the first spade to retain communications|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may land in the same place at this table |pg||
nt|dimi: Dutch ladies lost another 10 imps in b9, Sweden was in 5@d instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not just bridge partner |pg||
nt|kingcur: that's very sad news indeed :( may she rest in peace|pg||
mb|4H|nt|agumperz:  so he played the spade jack to lure friedland into winning the first spade from a holding of AKxxx|pg||
nt|baldjean: sorry to hear that. very sad, especially for Benito Garozzo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzcb: Very sad news indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: straightforward, eh?|pg||
nt|tez: 4 nt is quantitative in my opinion|pg||
nt|bobholl: carla worth 5@C ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: i doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  it would have been a nice play if the spades had been Tx opposite AKxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards even 6@H is on with @H 22|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess they play 2nt here as lebensohl that explains the 4@H bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|swanson:  I prefer an immediate spade overcall by East, to be followed by a takeout double of hearts, or possibly another spade bid.|pg||
nt|mouser:  I agree. He dug himself a hole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: North confirms they play Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ritong: in a lot of people' opinion|pg||
nt|ritong: sign me in|pg||
nt|tez: last here..ty all enjoyed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 imp to the dutch :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: and 5 @D making 6 no less |pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: W will duck with AKxxx 4 sure|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he should|pg||
nt|agumperz:  but Bessis was thinking|pg||
nt|agumperz:  he just failed to sider this possibility|pg||
nt|agumperz:  consider|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kingcur: And likely unaware of this sad news, NS are meanwhile on their way to another gain for Holland, staying low in 2@S with other table down in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was looking and only -1 in game is quite good |pg||
nt|bobholl: nice gain for the dutch (again) |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 9 imps but 10 is possible (ruff @C free and make 6)|pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: descartando el @h perdedor en el @c|pg||
nt|baldjean: Important 9@c with N here. excgange it with the 6@c of E, and it makes a lot of difference|pg||
nt|kingcur: and bd 9 another 13 for Holland....wow|pg||
nt|kingcur: Pasman-Simons in the club slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: touted off of a ht lead at this table with the hts being in E hand |pg||
nt|baldjean: exchange*|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am looking do n/s still have time to beat it?|pg||

nt|agumperz:  This match has been an excellent performance by the Amoils team|pg||
nt|kingcur: S looking at a 15 count, but it looks like Emmenthal cheese, it lacks shape and she has a 1NT opener behind her, making it very dangerous to bid at these colours|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H or pass always a (difficult) guess|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rijase: Rafa, ganan algún clasificatorio por esta copa?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D two way drury?|pg||

pc|cT|mc|11|nt|swanson:  Does look routine, but East would bid 3@H and get raised, so it wouldn't affect the outcome.|pg||
