pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jain: we r set for an interesting battle for sure|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|dslee: well, this would be a tough one to make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|p dalvi: spade switch but then declarer has to play on D |pg||
nt|dslee: is this the contract?|pg||

nt|rv: Dr, don't tell President, I am neutral here:)|pg||
nt|key1809: its human to cheer for the current under dogs|pg||
nt|drkvas:  the battle between  MI& KKR  NO NEUTRALS:)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|drkvas:  WILL TELLL HIM U WERE NEUTRAL OK:)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: 4@d?|pg||
mb|d|nt|key1809: 6@c makes here, but very tough to reach this slam|pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: 4@c rebid looked normal|pg||
nt|r_tibre: agree CK|pg||
nt|rv: I don't know what 4@s shows, either 4@d/4@c or even 3@d would be my choices for consideration|pg||
nt|key1809: 4s might be kickback |pg||
nt|nkgupt: looked like rkc that 4@s but the respose does not tally|pg||
mb|6S|nt|key1809: 5@d showed 2 w/o Q|pg||
nt|r_tibre: oh boy|pg||
mb|7H|nt|r_tibre: S wakes up|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes an artificial 3@d another possibility i suppose, though prefer that with strong balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|r_tibre: guess this may be the decider|pg||
nt|key1809: this is undiscipline to the core|pg||
nt|key1809: in|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: 6@h could make even on this trump break if you get it rite|pg||
nt|rv: Chotan plays a lot on gut feel, his 7@h not thing of beauty|pg||
nt|r_tibre: how can 5@D  improve ur hand?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|key1809: 5@d was justa reply|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|psyck: if W wanted to consider 7@h, he could make a forcing pass of 6@s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rv: I think Key is right, 4@s might be kickback, 5@d response ignored double and shows 2 keys w/o @HQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|key1809: and west might have thought it showed 2 w ith Q|pg||
nt|r_tibre: well.. if 4@S kickback... then that itself seems a huge mistake... and 5@D then denied @HQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|drkvas:  n chotan thought rdbl as 1st step etc might not vave discussed fully|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|drkvas:  have|pg||
nt|rv: Chotan started life as auction bridge (no premium for bidding games and slams accurately since there is no game/slam bonus) player in Kolkatta, he is a very good card player but ...|pg||
nt|rv: not very scientific in bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: playing ROPI 5@d showed none of the above|pg||
mc|12|nt|r_tibre: no sympathies if routine sequences undiscussed after all these years|pg||
nt|psyck: if could show even key card with a void|pg||
pg||
qx|c16|st||md|2SQ9853H9DQ8542CT3,SA62HA643DCAKJ864,SKJT4HQJ82DKTC975,S7HKT75DAJ9763CQ2|sv|e|nt|subhranp:  this hand again illustrating the importance of Ts and 9s. NS have 25hcp but EW have most of the Ts and 9s|pg||
nt|subhranp: North's 2s probably showing a lower hcp after dbl by partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Current Leaders in Pairs are 1) Umesh-Bhaskar 2) RA Agarwal-Samantt 3) VM Lal- Bhiwandkar|pg||
mb|1C|nt|subhranp: good pickup by Manashda|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxv: Welcome Subs!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jain: 3c does make for NS in last hand|pg||
nt|jain: agressive 4s |pg||
nt|subhranp: hey vikrant, now donning a new role?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|subhranp:  we should see a correction later on|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dslee: shd be a 1NT for chotan and kach|pg||
nt|bhallak:  Difficult defense for 4@H. At this vul, better to bid 4@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bhallak:  hi subs|pg||
nt|subhranp: this is a big board.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|p dalvi: F nt to show weak raise later but south has two suitor 5-5 and north has some usful @Ds|pg||
nt|jain: hi GA sub,lee bhai nd all the kibs,hopefully we get to watch better bridge than the QF's|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|dslee: Hi nirmal, sunil . welcome|pg||
nt|jain: hi sunil|pg||
mb|4D|nt|p dalvi: I think 3@D is from south |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: just back from a heavy lunch as i hope most of you being thestart of a long weekend|pg||
nt|jain: why didnt west come in the first time with 2 bullets balanced hand |pg||
mb|6C|nt|jain: may b 1nt shows a good raise in heart,hence?|pg||
nt|uttam: spade guess to make 10 tricks,as club j dropping|pg||
nt|jain: hi uttam|pg||
nt|uttam: hi friends|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: what shd Jitu play back low or J?|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp:  again a very useful diamond Ten in East hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jain: spade wl b guessed easily|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|key1809: hi all|pg||
nt|dslee: more or less sure that Dipak would have the @C entry somewhere down the line to cash those @D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Deb, Nirmal, Subhransu|pg||
pc|s4|nt|key1809: west is forced to play the club ace to prevent entry going in North's hand|pg||
nt|dslee: well but with chotan, those of you who knows him, anything is possible on the table - one of the most intutive players in the game in India today|pg||
nt|dslee: hi Key Jaan|pg||
nt|MBV53: surprisingly closed room attendence is more!!|pg||
nt|key1809: Hi Debgiri|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Key|pg||
nt|key1809: the return of the @D 2 , trusting a true card, finesse doesnt seem logical|pg||
nt|key1809: hi Sunil|pg||
nt|jain: hi,i guess we have one too many here to commentate,do the other room have anyone else apart from rv else let a few move from here to the other room|pg||
nt|key1809: ill go the open room|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: great shift|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dslee: probably the best Jitu could do under these conditions|pg||
nt|jain: now more easy as W has turned up with 2 bullets|pg||
nt|uttam: h will be over ruffed . 9 now,unless d finess,h pitch, dec knows all HCP now,after two aces by west|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|d6|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 6@s double would have gone 5 down, +1100 converted to -100|pg||
nt|r_tibre: on accurate def, 6@S-x was more than 6@C/@H making|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rv: Key's prediction could turn out true|pg||
nt|key1809: Raju and Ajay will apply the bhikhari rule and take whatever they put in the katora|pg||
nt|psyck: DOPI/ROPI are generally used below 5 level of agreed suit & DEPO above 5 level of suit.  DOPI=dbl 1st step, pass next step.  DEPO = dbl even pass odd|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|rv: I wouldn't O/C 1@H with North hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: suit lacks quality|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that 1@H is a king's bid, not a bhikari's :)|pg||
nt|rv: Key commented too soon, President is being generous|pg||
pc|dT|nt|key1809: but raju overcalls which many will debate its worth|pg||

nt|jain: a minor slam for NS,will they reach |pg||
nt|jain: 2 very good teams battling for the top honors|pg||
nt|jain: a slam for EW here|pg||
nt|jain: if S preempts 3s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Ajay was touching spade and 13th trick interchagingly, and chose club ultimately and in the end apologised to his partner|pg||
nt|jain: nd S will with fav vul|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi nirmal|pg||
nt|jain: hi subs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Current Leaders in Pairs are 1) Umesh-Bhaskar 2) RA Agarwal-Samantt 3) Venky-Vijay|pg||

mb|p|nt|p dalvi: undo pl|pg||

mb|p|nt|jain: pass|pg||
nt|jain: feared that nd it will die down|pg||
nt|subhranp: there are some very useful 9s here for NS. 3nt on for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|dslee: puts Jitu on lead|pg||
nt|jain: wow,N did well to keep it open|pg||
nt|subhranp: hope north is not touching the bidding box now!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jain: 5d|pg||
nt|uttam: to start with,nORTH  has to keep 1s open|pg||
nt|jain: 5d is my guess nd ppp|pg||
nt|jain: calls for a sure x from W's hand|pg||
nt|jain: with 19 20 also 3 nt nd even this hand 3n?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: yes and so it did|pg||
nt|jain: arun jain is the sponsorer of manashda team,a fine gentleman|pg||
nt|jain: ajay wont duck|pg||
nt|jain: as he knows N has no spade|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jain: 31 doesnt that huge with 42 brds to go but seems other room  already have had 1 brd:(|pg||
nt|jain: doesnt seem|pg||
nt|jain: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: good mrg here we are in the 2nd session of Q/F|pg||
nt|p dalvi: west would not be passing as with 14 points|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: only a @D lead wd have been chalenging.. but tough on the bidding|pg||
nt|uttam: well bid by ns|pg||
mb|p|nt|jain: will clm 7 soon|pg||
nt|subhranp: likely spade lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|p dalvi: Anil and rajesh regular old pd ship |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: challenging. sry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dslee: wont challange much - but being a weak hand - he did the right thing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jain: wld kacchu have balanced with 1nt if N had passed?|pg||
nt|jain: had 1 bad brd,missing too many words|pg||
nt|subhranp: if he ducks this or could get into trouble|pg||
nt|jain: spade j10 comes to the rescue|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jain: so a good start for the manyawar,it has 2 formidable partnership,raju nd ajay,anil nd dalal nd the third between sunit nd swarnendu is a new combo which seems to b doing well too|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|jain: wld u balance uttam jee|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|jain: am sure the other room will b in 6|pg||
nt|jain: but diff to switch to club |pg||
