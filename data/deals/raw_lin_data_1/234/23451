nt|vugraphzea: Last board of this year's Senior Camrose|pg||
nt|kareno:  The reason for preempting is to make the other side make the last guess.  So double was his own guess and against theory for me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzea: At start of this match GB about 10 (or 12) ahead of Scotland|pg||
nt|kareno:  Double gained an IMP for him I guess.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzea: and scotland a mere 4 ahead of england|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzea: all very close|pg||
pc|s8|nt|golfsquash: Yes, swap the south and east hands and it might make|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  the CR still has a couple of boards to play after this |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno:  A practical bid by east that just won't succeed with the diamond offisde and the club in north.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|kareno:  I guess north can claim a 'senior moment.'|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno:  It is the Senior Camrose, isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: plus one|pg||
nt|kareno:  Yes.  North should be leading the spade ten back to show the club entry.  I guess he was afraid of solid diamonds in east.|pg||
mc|10|nt|golfsquash: amazing.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks Karen, thanks Julia and thanks Rory|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Declarer claimed|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Thx all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: 2 boaRDS to play in other room|pg||
nt|kareno:  If you live long enough, you see it all.  I don't try to outguess the cards so I would stolidly return my lowest high spade.|pg||
nt|kareno:  Pleasure and Julia you did a smashingly good job!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: The results of the other 2 matches will help to determine overall winner of the event|pg||
nt|kareno:  Specs, what a week of bridge we're having :)|pg||
nt|kareno:  I've got to run to a baseball game - see you all another time!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: If GB win the overall result then they get the credit, but the trophy is awarded to one of the 5 nations playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I will leave table open, but if you need to rush off the final scores will be on tournament website here - http://www.seniorcamrose.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I understand one match finished in closed room, one match has a board to play, and in the 3rd there was a bidding sequence which players want a ruling on|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Not sure which match tho - |pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I believe a weak jump shift was not alerted in one match - oppo say they'd have bid if they realised (or similar)|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Still no final scores from other matches or the ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I will leave table open to let you know final result, but if you need to rush off the final scores will be on tournament website here - http://www.seniorcamrose....|pg||

nt|vugraphzea: http://www.seniorcamrose.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Provisional score for ROI v England is ROI 22 - 8 England|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Provisional scores (but there is a possible appeal which could change order of 2nd and 3rd places)|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I am told |pg||
nt|vugraphzea: GB 178, Scotland 172, England 154, ROI 147, Wales 135, Northern Ireland 109|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Looks some distance between 2nd and 3rd to me tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: So if comfirmed then GB win the event, but the trophy is awarded to highest scoring NBO - so looking like Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Maybe it's 3rd and 4th places which would be affected.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Website will have final scores when sorted out - http://www.seniorcamrose.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: OK i think ruling was in GB v Wales.  Result stands.  GB have won anyway, but might win by a little more should they appeal and win|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Thanks to all for watching - good evening from sunny Ayr!  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: Goodbye|pg||

nt|capercliff: perhaps|pg||
nt|capercliff: but at least you dont have to worry about getting doubled at the 3-level:)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Pass is the winnig action, but hard to find it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: bidding 2 with out the a or k of hearts but you have both |pg||

nt|capercliff: 2@s is NOT weak|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  B25 came in with an overtrick swing to England, and B26 gave 3 more imps|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  to England when the 2@H with QJ9632 opposite singleton 5 went 2 off (here 1 off)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  GB (not England, sorry) are now 7 imps ahead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  B29|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders failed to cash their @s, so 9 tricks in 1NT too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cash their @d rather |pg||
nt|capercliff: some action here?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bid to 3NT, which NS have just let through|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is an optimist |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  need your bidding boots on to reach game here|pg||
nt|golfsquash: will south pass|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like 2 trumps and 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|golfsquash: trump led at other table let it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I often get questions from readers of BRIDGE about what to do with the East hand|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this was the first board played in the other room, and S played 3N two off|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: I can count 9 tricks in @s's for E/W|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  trump lead from 10x is horrible|pg||
nt|golfsquash: The danger of not playing Drury|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pjs_ch:  with 24 hcp between the two hands the contract is not unexpected|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  the very poor spade spots plus the notrumpish nature of the heart suit have led East to pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  I transfer when my partner has four|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not before the defence takes 5 or so|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: the killing lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it started with a diamodn lead but then a heart switch in the other room|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and the defence get two aces and three hearts; the "easy" defence|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  2@d would not be a good spot at matchpoints :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has 5 top tricks and so should escape for 2 down, holding the loss to 1 IMP|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3Nt a fair vulnerable game but failing with the @cA offside|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I would prefer it to 4@s as the cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Rory, might you open 1@c on the South hand?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pjs_ch:  in the other room meant declarer had 5 red suit tricks when he got in,|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pjs_ch:  and he could not try to make his contract my playing clubs, so he|pg||
nt|golfsquash: it was a very good heart switch|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I tend to open 1@s and worry later.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  me too - though a response of 2@d or 2@h is far from unlikely|pg||
nt|golfsquash: this is getting deeper and deeper|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pjs_ch:  lsot the @CQ also;  here the more accurate (?), pointed (?) defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  did he really do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: all of this to take losing ht finesse?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzeb: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hoping for hearts 3-6 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then West will have no heart to lead after taking the third round of clubs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  an inteesting play in the @c suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  doesn't give declarer that extra losing option - they will cash the @SA I am sure|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in which case it is obvious to hold up now - so why the pause?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|capercliff: its a double finesse really|pg||
