mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: I wonder what explanations were given|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: the other room played a quiet 4@H|pg||

nt|po-s: 2 x spades then D to ace, crossruff|pg||

nt|viren169: Now he will get the @S right to for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: sadly he cant get back to his hand very easily|pg||
nt|ady: seems east overcalled a comic 1NT and double from south  west Robson then2@C   and when that was doubled declined to run to the 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|po-s: but 2D might have been a better choice|pg||
mc|13|nt|hedyg: and now making?|pg||
