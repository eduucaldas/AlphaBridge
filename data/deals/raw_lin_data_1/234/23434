nt|vugraphzft: hi all and welcome to this pre-chamions league final entertainment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We start the match with a change of players|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Scania thought they could meet the same players in both halfs since they play a complicated system, but it seems it wasn't complicated enough to make the cut|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|baldfriede: because it looks like the last board from the last set|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hi all and welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is the fifth match of the 2012 championships where we'll see Kamras, last year's runner-up, against the experienced Team Zang|pg||

nt|muppe: re-hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or sorry, since he has three hearts the ruff is available any way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but this discussion is academic as Wrang would lead a club|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: We've changed match in the vugraph once more|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone and wellcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They play a two way-club. 2@c shows 0-3 spades, GF unbal or 21+ bal|pg||

nt|muppe: hard to judge these high level auctions|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos:  loks like puppet|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  for running scores|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, North decided to put the dummy down before the lead was made :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  so N shows a  4 card major and South shows Spades  (by bifdding Hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is because last year North here played in team Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown his five spades and four clubs in the bidding, and West then gets to decide the final contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: an intra finesse in trumps does the work if declarer can handle the rest|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||

nt|oliverc: definitely|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: declarer went for the percentage play in trumps (if South had Kxx, low to the nine would have cost the contract) and went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back to Örebro where we're playing the third day out of four in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove is in fact in the lead with 0.5 VP|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  We have a sign in the Copenhagen harbour, it reads: "Keep Denmark tidy, see a Swede to the ferry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both pairs play strong club though their methods are slightly different|pg||
nt|bt: yea and half the danes can even read it |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but +110 is not bad|pg||

nt|baldfriede: I had a look at the convention card of N/S, but it is in Swedish, and all I understand is Smörgasbröd. :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and maybe N/S won't even be in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a grand, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Playing a rather unusual system where pass is 0-7 or 17+|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzeg: another possible 3NT NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Dbl was for penalty according to East|pg||

mb|4S|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) They play a short club with transfer responses and three weak twos|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract won't be pretty if Wrang finds a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it looks like they can take 6 red suit tricks, the ace of clubs and three trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that would be 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgi:  round 5 updated - http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Most play it as pass with spades, correct with hearts|pg||

nt|kemperg: as Roland explains|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  This is about to go 4 down|pg||

nt|baldfriede: neither would I|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or 10-12 with support|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Good a'noon Martin :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: EW use rather similar methods|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Running scores: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 8-11, 4@S and any singleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzft: Sorry?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I agree with the NT-opening, it might be wrong but it simplifies the auction so much|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: So we will now follow "The Fight of the Forcing Pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have the values for game, and enough tricks as well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|muppe: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Playing a 5-2 in a major seemed successful on the last board, so why not now?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  N-s would appear to lose a @s and a @c in any suit contrat.|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Everything breaks perfectly for declarer, he just doesn't know that yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hello Vesa |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As someone mentions, 6@d was a lucky make on the last board which one of the top teams had to experience|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS  abit unlucky here in that South's values are mostly no help|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so a kind of garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|mamos:  garbage is the word|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops, that run didn't do EW any good|pg||
pc|d5|nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky for south diamonds will be overruffed in dummy and hearts in hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
nt|bt: see if ns can sort this out, though i think east ran premature there|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that blew a trick (not that it was by any means strange)|pg||
nt|bt: and only one diamond cashes|pg||
nt|bt: 2@C was difficult to double |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, that might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but I guess South would have tried 2NT|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kemperg: 4@C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, some partscore overbidding here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sundell knows that his p is short in @H... still a brave 3@C with his 4-3-3-3|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|bt: a slow double of 2@C looks perfect|pg||
nt|bt: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzft: A trump shift might induce North to take the finesse in hearts|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: After a quiet start this can be more interesting :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6n by north is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1NT showed a maximum (11+) and 3@C was natural, might have been canapé|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you're still interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here comes a board with really bad breaks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we have Hans- Ove's son Alexander watching his dad in action here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so every VP crucial|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6@h is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: (due to an upper cut)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But 6NT is always making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin was not happy with his partner|pg||
nt|bt: so the double of 1nt asked for a @S lead, know north will ask why he didnt lead it|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe an imp to SS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 9 imps on board one when EW played 4H X -1 at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13 hcp, normally a 6-c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  Forsberg-GrÃ¶nkvist leading in the current running scores, but very small differences|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@d = 8-11, bal/4M5+m/5-5m|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in the end situation |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mikael and Jim|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a quiet 2@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sivve got off to a nice start when NS in the other room reached 3NT on board 13|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzft: Director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: hi!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that contract didn't make and picked up 12 imps|pg||

nt|runnerup:  south is shut out of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Ida will bid 2@D now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and that will end the auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems wrong explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to EW it's the double that's incorrect, not the explanation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||

nt|fabsayc: pass is just plain wrong imho|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Grähs guesses to pass his partner's short club|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW use a strong club|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wygbe1: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to CC a normal weak 2:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/pekksalo1.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will lead to a 4-2 fit instead of a 4-4 one|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras has had a nice start here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: one down in a vulnerable game that could make and then +800|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: let's see if Scania can turn this around|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||
nt|mamos:  can they bid a slam from North|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d by n also available now|pg||
nt|mamos:  indeed mayne now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North has a very good hand for seing partner open 2@C gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang with a successful decision here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might push NS into 5@H down (it could also make)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|runnerup:  4 @h needs careful play |pg||
nt|po-s: "making 12" gör jag som spelförare|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yet another 1NT-3NT with a 4c major. We've seen several of these auctions this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
nt|kattbridge: singelton?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  40 and diamonds like that, hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT was good, a pen.dbl too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also 3nt sits|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ah, finally a CC which is in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... and this is two down misguessing spades, otherwise only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: In the other room East opened the bidding on his five-count(in the 6@d-board)|pg||
nt|muppe: this seems makeable, EW had a save available in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Some players use 2@C as artifical but 2@D is normally nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 2@D wasn't making|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2 @D, 3 @S and 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so only a minor swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would guess he will finesse spades since it's an odds-on play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H showed a bad raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Showing 6-16. They ended up in 3NT nevertheless|pg||
nt|kattbridge: opps, let´s see if F finds hartlead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Håkan thought 3@H showed 5-6 or so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin is not happy...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's of course normal when 3433 |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Communications are rather terrible on this board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
nt|bt: arvidsson read a lot into the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: win in hand and low diamon?|pg||
nt|bt: this is a make now, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *diamond|pg||
nt|bt: fredin should have just continued diamonds|pg||
nt|bt: clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess @C doubleton happens very rarely when u open 1@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but with an Ace i wd respond too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i don't really know their style but I think this is the only distribution when it's only two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: some pairs (including myself) open all balanced hands w/o a 5c M 1@C, then it's much more frequent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that may be and only occurs 3% of time, but that is not the reason pass is wrong|pg||
nt|muppe: @h lead cost a trick here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: playing with diamonds as trump would probably have made you happier|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: will be an easy road to 11 tricks for declarer now|pg||
nt|muppe: E need to cash his @c A now unless he wont make a trick with it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: partner could have a huge hand where 4@H makes|pg||

nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree Martin and the hands cud fit well with his 4-4 in the rounded suits|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hard to see any other than 140 here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wygbe1: good choice by north, protecting his club holding|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cuebids are fine but i thk S shd take control with rkc at some point|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5NT was RKC|pg||
nt|runnerup:  po-s idea north should tranfer to @c and suth with good hand bids 3 @c now south is declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: sex sang går väl bra|pg||
nt|runnerup:  south|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Which is strengthed by North's explanations|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: fast claim here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i mean N can have a similar hand with the @Ca instead of the kj.. then 7 is cold|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won 11 imps on board 1 when 3NT went down in the open room|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: it wasn't even a promotion since he had a trump trick by force|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Sun does not know that... P cud hv @Cqx|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyhow, one down is the likely result in 2@H (two spades, two hearts and two diamonds) so that might result in a push|pg||

nt|bt: good choice |pg||
nt|muppe: their only hope is that OR will be in 6@c -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Some very harsh words exchanged|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 10 more imps for Sivve since NS in the other room reasonably ducked game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Another good breaking board|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the worst slam /east but 3nt +3 normal result|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Their card does not say enything but 1@C=3+ cards|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wygbe1: with that, n might have bid 6c over 5nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 10-13 opening once more|pg||
nt|bt: in a strong club framework many would open the west hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||
nt|bt: lets see what mr bergdahl decides here, he is creative :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS only have one loser but do not make slam with the bad brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: true, but that wasn't the case :)|pg||
nt|muppe: Lucky slam here for EW, but after N overcall it could even be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, +400 EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: N to take the safe?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT for EW?|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like a fairly straightforward 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 3@D by NS is likey down too. let us see|pg||
nt|kattbridge: maybe same system as after 1 NT opening, som play 3 in major as singel|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzft: Bennet and Bergdahl here are two of the more creative players in the tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we can hope for some fireworks, if not on this board but maybe later :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So South determines the hand is worth one bid and elects to make it a @H raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@D = relay, 2@H = any M|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzft: Having no eight card fit, they decide to settle in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: No, and they didn't have any agreement on 3@H but Fredin thought it was obvious|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos:  2@S will have attracted the best lead but I dont like bidding there on that|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: all about picking up clubs, which he will do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that brave 2@D bid has pushed E/W overboard here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@s being invitational with 5 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a figth .migth end on losing level|pg||
nt|bt: arent they already?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards don't sit nicely so 3nt migth fail -@d lead coming -perhaps helps but not enougth --but on 1- level no problems |pg||
nt|jcwla:  This time catches partner with six. A surprising sellout by EW and not a victory for artificiality.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bt: 3nt is a weird bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it shows @H and a maximum, not that strange right?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow North has faith in his partner's NV overcall|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup:  yes but you have to make rigth thing to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|bt: i think ns did very well to find their fit here, lets see what he does. playing on diamonds after being shortened in dummy doesnt look likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  So best in to play @H before taking the clubs - difficult thou|pg||
nt|mamos:  nope its pushed  NS overboard as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think North bid great, I wouldn't have overcalled 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  7:2 for running scores|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos:  NS did need to get into the action somehow |pg||
nt|mamos:  but needed to know when to stop pushing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a balanced hand with 10 hcp is not a two level overcall, non-vul or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice low @S by Sundell|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Catastrophy stroke on board 2 for Adde when his partner had to play 3@S and went 4 down vulnerable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so this shd go down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This gave Hans-Ove 10 imps|pg||
nt|bt: well i assumed 2@S was an ask as opposed to natural :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: there is no alert ;)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: persson is going for the throw in, his best chance|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|baldfriede: unfortunate lay-out here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt: east gives count in hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  Or S can keep the @HA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes. nice play|pg||

nt|kattbridge: in mr fredins world everything is Obvius|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But I do agree with him here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|baldfriede: very well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as so often is the case, the five-level belonged to the opponents|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very rigth|pg||
nt|bt: the 9th spade was missing unfortunately|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: anybodys lead, small from QJxxx?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2 down non-vulnerable and undoubled is a very reasonable score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyway, 3@D is also down|pg||
nt|po-s: an unblock would have been better|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So making 3 - next|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will go one down|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|bt:  now maybe south shouldnt invite knowing they have a 8card fit and maximum 23 hcp?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East doesn't look very happy right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: don't know if it's cause partner's thinking or because he thinks he made an error himself|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west must have a clear picture ruff and trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kattbridge: yes, with 5-6 he would just bid 2 h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|baldfriede: played !N for @h and thus lost the overtrick|pg||

nt|mamos:  hands fit very well for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East apologized for not doubling|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that's why he was upset|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Our operator is the one and only Ida GrÃ¼nzwiebel from Mozambique|pg||
nt|jcwla:  No real point to guessing the @DJ there as will not provide two pitches for @S, only goal was to try to sneak a trick through.|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky but normal|pg||
nt|bt: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, no reason to expect anything but a push or 3 imps to San Sac|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was it really nessessary to finess when north had bid ,but it is only 1 imp |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3VP is the difference between 1st and 4th at the moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: has given me many spadeleads :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 1 game contract so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here EW makes 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 4@S for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So it will probably come to South in third seat with a close decision, with 11 prime HCP and four @S I think most would dare to open.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At board 3, Göran Adde found a protective 2NT holding 4-4 in the ms after 1@H-2@H which lead to 3@D -1 and 4 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
nt|jcwla:  West will show two suits, N does not have a bid.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now - has West shown specifically the pointed suits, I wonder.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I suppose either way East might bid 3@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a good spade game|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pass with 6-5 and 5 @c otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: even though I can't see why they would end up there :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strait forfard game should be -but so i thougth also in last board that they try 3nt -but no|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What is Wikner's next move? He is a strong chess player also|pg||
nt|jcwla:  OK, an even bigger jump. West will probably raise with such good trumps.|pg||
nt|bt: 6@D a little better at teams|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Could 2@C be majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This will be interesting|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Or is it specifically @D and @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I don't think we know|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Ida?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think they play it like most people in Sweden, showing @s + other|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but can't you play in 8 cards fit in @h|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Undiscussed calls should be as natural as possible, but what is natural here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = always unbalanced, 1NT = 4+ @C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ok, maybe not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but at least decent :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: won't make this time anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west in bidding his strength not his suits =support --|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If West did not have @D's, E was perfectly willing to hear @H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Clubs being out of the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, 4@S sort of carries a connotation of a sixth spade here, but W obviously liked the texture.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, look at that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  new suit found on 4-level hmm|pg||
nt|bt: the fredin double :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or maybe not, 1NT is something resembling a balanced hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange, 20 count bids once, his partner volunarily with 2 count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: def shd take the @D ruff and take this down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
nt|runnerup:  this bidding beats me |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Looks like a make|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, now i have some back up for saying that Bennet is creative at least :)|pg||
nt|muppe: easy 2@s, with @d  3-3  and @s 3-2 probably making an overtrick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think declare should touch trumps here, might make anyway though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bt: now 5@C maybe?|pg||
nt|bt: "I have AK"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bt: this wasnt the worst slam ever|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: no kidding|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hardly after this bidding|pg||
nt|bt: now 6@S looks very easy, what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but @d must be set up before the 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos:  he will havwe worries because if this finesse had failed and there been another force life might have got very sticky|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well bid!|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I guess that 1 nt is a semibalanced min. hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @h marked with South for the opening... so best to run to dummy and take @H fin i thk|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Hk|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: ok, now he will probably go for D|pg||
nt|bt: a club finesse, club, then a diamond was the easy way|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu now in the lead since Grönkvist-Forsberg let 2@D through on 15|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h migth make -@s Ace and @s -KJ in @h and @d -@s ruff and more @d -now west out of @s -and makes -but not easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he could have ditched a club on the heart return though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: then pitch another on the queen later|pg||
nt|bt: he couldnt believe south had this huge hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|runnerup:  obviously 450 in this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The TD has been summoned|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: because of the alert/lack of alert of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that it showed spades has been proven|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opps extra room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt: but this looks fine too|pg||

nt|runnerup:  ok thats why he bid 1nt -no support |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As you might have noticed EW play the most natural version of the forcing pass, letting all one openings be 4+ although limited|pg||
nt|muppe: yeah, the only thing that really matters...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|underdogg:  both pass and 1@c shows 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT   a possibility here |pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine how they can bid to 6@D, though|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he tried to bid as if he had opened 1@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards still sitting nicely 7 @d on cards -6 ok to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: ... probably not|pg||
nt|po-s: how  do you make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Inventive opening by W|pg||
nt|milton_se:  good slam - one finesse out of two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A lot of penalty VP's have been dealt out during the last three days as teams havn't been finished on time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|underdogg:  1@c as respons to pass opening|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 3nt here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so moysian 2 @d which playes well|pg||
nt|bt: in theory south has a clear pass, partner couldnt act over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it explains that much :)|pg||
nt|turnip1:  yes, in a strange way...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: so much for that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hey ns has found a game 2ntX-makes ---but south run |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Would have liked more prime round-suit holdings, an ace or a void. And the @SA would have been nice for @D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3N is better than 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Typically 3rd seat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|underdogg:  1@d = 0-7 now|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@h 20+|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Just the auction s was hoping for.|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts will work but you may try spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  safe level 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@S is non-forcing, stronger hands would bid 1@H first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It takes finding the queen of trumps to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That might indeed cost the victory now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  biercard also here 7 @d -bidding and play -can you have 2 biers if you bid and it is last also|pg||
mb|3C|nt|runnerup:  something to guess here -best if you find @h J |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 140?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not that obvious after the take out from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3NT was made by Larsson|pg||
nt|nilsland:  on the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she got a diamond-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not that it helps that much|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But they'll get to the spade game|pg||
nt|bt: yes i prefer @H, please dont take it seriously|pg||
nt|bt: now, he is tempted .... can partner have spades? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I don't think you deserve two beers for bidding this grand missing the @dK :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not here but in principe |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And also, in Sweden at least, it doesn't count if diamonds is trump. Is that a local rule or does it work that way world wide?|pg||
nt|muppe: South has nice controls, he should support @d now|pg||
nt|milton_se:  South has an excellent hand now - North showing 5-card @Ds, I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4+, but still|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  0-4/5-7bal 1@s|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c game forceing now from W|pg||
nt|runnerup:  open cards it is easy to beat by @d ruffs |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = @S, 1NT = 17-19 bal (upgraded)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once again east was too timid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @d small best now|pg||
nt|kattbridge: Tommy, where are the red card?|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry|pg||
nt|bt: can east be balanced?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|runnerup:  imanigation notist -it is obvious bid .don't you think -and -not for children -that's ehy this brake|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sorry for that, the client crashed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzft: On  1, Hans-Ove won 5 imps for making 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores|pg||
nt|mamos:  WEst had a strong  hand  too strong to just bid game also  but you were right uncomfortable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but 5@D is also a make so EW will only lose an overtrick imp or so|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Or ....|pg||
nt|kattbridge: electicity back:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup:  but I am still wandering if pass to 1 @s gets better score |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: np, just wondered if you saw something I didn't :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe North could suggest 3N over 3@S?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Definitely.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos:  as long as they stop :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In case of doubt lead trumps.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  migth have been 80 -if 13. @d will have been switched in rigth moment but not now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so safe level was the idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But he does not know partner has hearts too|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Easier for us|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps he finds Jx of heart a bit scary|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he don't use that card so much -thats why asked (6@h) important for some and bier you can think for any reasons|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: this looks to have been well judged by both pairs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzft: If he's 8 -12|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Despite the lead directing 1@d - he gets a club lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  A stopper is as strong as you make it look like|pg||
pc|s6|nt|underdogg:  If someone wants to know more about the system E/W are playing, here's a link: http://bridge.winge.se/mediawiki/index.php/Symetriskt_RelÃ¤pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR play 2@S at B15. Looks like a 1IMPer for Scania.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: yes P is showing 16 to 19 and he should want to be in game if he is 17,18 or 19.. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: curtains|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this looks like one down|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mamos:  Yes  we seem to have reached the limit of the hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup:  declarer swets more if north leads @d J|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Until proven guilty|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well...Do both @D's go away now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  in a court of law with Jordan as a presecutor|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  prosecutor even|pg||
nt|jcwla:  persecutor|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bt: then he had a guess here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: * 8 - 11|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I plead not guilty|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but you make this also missguessing so only overtricks|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Third-seat bids, especially third-seat white-on-red bids, have such a strong lead-directing connotation that I have a simple rule:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that double to 4 @s scares south a bit -clever double with singleton|pg||
nt|milton_se:  Team SanSac back in business now- from 12-18 to 16-14|pg||
nt|po-s: om man nu ska täcka så tror jag kungen är bättre|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT -1 picked up 12 against 2@S +1 at the other tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu and Forsberg-Grönkvist gaining 6|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe he should have opened 1@C to get a diamond lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|runnerup:  no -still makes sorry yes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: i thk slam makes as there are 4 entries to dummy to set up the 5th @C for the @S discard.. except on a @S lead ie|pg||

nt|po-s: nord an sina färgbehandlingar|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: better odds for Hx than 9x|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which probably means "North and his handling of suits"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you want to bid 2 @s -weak but partner opens --so cant you defende 1 @s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And he went down in a normal way|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it will be, i am betting my old slippers on it|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What was unlucky about it?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but as in many cases Fredin made rigth decisions and his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nyström-Upmark kom i 5@C på bricka 3 och vann därmed 10 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  they probably play 1nt conventional|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt best here but may end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west can hold him self quited -he may have the previlise to defende not play @s|pg||
nt|jcwla:  South has a clear pass now. The opening was dubious enough.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Nice bid by W to show some values.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It doesn't neccessarily have to be unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||
nt|bt:  you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65 for running scores of all matches|pg||
nt|bt: i agree on passing 1@S, but bergdahl rarely chooses the "normal" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both 6@D and 6@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Cards aren't situated brilliantly for EW|pg||
nt|bt: this is in sweden known as "polish scissors" 55any, less than an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont believe that ew will find @d -lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nice lead|pg||
nt|kattbridge: 4 harts is making here, if droppig the jack|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Why shouldn't they? There is no point in playing 2NT now as natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: woho|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  doesn't 'otur' mean 'bad luck?'|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Thats what my dad taught me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in common tongue, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in bridge circles it's appliable to loads of situations :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thing is, this might now make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it can but line is far from obvious|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but here Scania can get some back|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i meant not|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This will hold and S will exit a @S in preference to breaking either round suits. Remember as defender, you should avoid breaking new suits unless it's very likely to be right.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Usually kicks half a trick or more each time you do.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sjöberg is taking the bull by the horns|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct:  well he has 8 certain tricks so choices are find the @H10 or the @CQ or let the opponents find one of those card for you|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  coffee one /without this opening =2@h nothing to talk |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Hmm|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@SX would have costed.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|runnerup:  lets say well found 1 @S then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  rigth but average pair rarely has spoken these serious |pg||
nt|runnerup:  should of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the Swedish Championship finals, average pairs shouldn't have come this far|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Must have got a suit pref signal there somehow|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzft: and even without prior discussion you can calculate what it shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I am very surprised East passed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzft: well bid and a deserved make is what we can expected|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If so might as well have cashed @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS is known to be a very inventive pair at least|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzft: North perhaps simply chose to make an overcall on his nice 4c suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think finessing in @h won t help you much anyway|pg||
nt|bt: on board 3 yoda gained 11 imps, though there was possibly a tactical hesitation by north, so director is called|pg||
pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry but lets say you have to 'nose' these places|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s is optimistic and was it nessessary for south to bid 2 @s -perhpas not|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was sugseeded that delayed raise shoe extra -this not -ok in that case 2 @s was the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang counted South for 4@S (he thought they played support redoubles)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|runnerup:  every time I try that -partner has xx and 7 points -and we play there insteadt of 1nt +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The jack of hearts was costy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzft: I guess we're all born with different ammounts of luck :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  YES  South's line in 4@s on Board 17 in OR is a bit of a mystery  |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... but they missed slam on  5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzft: The question asked to the director now is wether it's ok by North to draw conclusions from South's switch, knowing it was forced|pg||

nt|baldfriede: hm, should have been an overtrick. N/S have no way of cashing their @h trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South's only chance was play for AK with East|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6@H and 6NT are good here for NS|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6@H is a great contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang says he would have made if the AK of @C would have stood up|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was down one in the end anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But could have been more gory|pg||
nt|bt: the ns pair plays 2nt as "9-11 (semi)balanced, no 4 major, not mandatory" :)|pg||
nt|bt: unluckily west will open first here|pg||
nt|bt: and he has a major|pg||
nt|bt: meanwhile ns at the other table took a toilet break, during bidding, unusual|pg||
nt|bt: we have a fire alarm in the hotel, so play is closed right now|pg||
nt|bt: maybe fredin was very upset over the hesitation|pg||
nt|bt: there is supposedly a fire there, lets hope everyone is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Uheld|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He could have made by ruffing with the nine or jack of spades instead of pitching|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes this beats really true no entry -was so clever defence that rarely seen |pg||
nt|milton_se:  good play from both sides|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very soon|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: he claimed 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which means he played the queen of hearts from hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras have picked up 4 more imps on 16 and 17 for an undoubled undertrick vs one doubled and one undertrick vs two|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: sorry had 4 in mind|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S not friedly but.......|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Now 4 teams within 3.3 VP|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup:  partial only here @s /@d but lets see if more in bidden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After all the effort we have to put in to teach novices to finesse, we have to put in even more to teach them when not to.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  a solid 6 @s here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6nt the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  She is used to play with Micke :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: even though with a duck of the lead, it's making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I'd rather not interfe as S here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: interfere*|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here I agree with South's bud|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you're 5-5 with decent intermediates|pg||
nt|po-s: om Väst skulle ha ru Qx så vore andra vändor inte så bra|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|underdogg:  8-11 5+@d, no 4 card M, if only 5@d he will have 4@c as well.|pg||
nt|kemperg: brave 3@D without @Hs|pg||
nt|runnerup:  to beat 3 @s you have to lead @h Ace|pg||
nt|mamos:  lol and an eight count|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you take away the two-level from your opponents|pg||
nt|oliverc: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A 12-15 NT, not that common|pg||
nt|runnerup:  standard 3nt ..continues|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with all the controls i guess Sundell shd prefer the @H contract|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6NT is quite a bit better as you can survive 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3@H is slaminvitational w/o ShS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/86gquww for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = a bad raie|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *raise|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west is not afread -2 @c majors -so can east holm him self low|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzft: I'd say it was more the competition in its whole's fault. Then of course we had boards of our own that made the whole difference. But yes, it was rather annoying that everything ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: would end with that board...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i can count 10 hcp, and it's not like partner is going to punish me when he's pre-passed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Uheld is Danish|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Interesting, double or 1NT with N? I think 1NT esp since we have seen 1@C could be short.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but don't he finess @h then |pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: pretty routine hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed not|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess he'll just launch into keycards now|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|petka:  4H looks nice here|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B17 ended as here in 3NT with a @S lead. Looks as a push.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  some carefull play needed like @c Ace and @h away now after @h A|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: could E make a take out now?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now with known 8-card fit E will probably bid 2@H.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  skall inte sitsen vara klar sÃ¥ dags?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzft: Hi again! After having evacuated the hotel due to fire, we're back and ready to play|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Markku|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This just seems to be guesswork.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He passes with the words: "I'm too tired"|pg||
nt|turnip1:  And these 4 meet in final round|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3Nt is also making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no double -ok but some of|pg||
nt|mamos:  it might be your opponents who punish you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might have pushed EW into 4@H which partner can double|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Only 8 tricks here, unles there is a miracle|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C = GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The show must go on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Perhaps not the best argument but|pg||
nt|po-s: he should have, but who knows|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baldfriede: unless*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: May be less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if the opponents catching you is what you're worried about you should compare that to all the upsides of acting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont think that it is easy to bid -claiming in declarer play is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: N has shown 45+/54+ in the minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Slam is on the heart guess here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nilsson paused for some time over 1@H, might give the show away|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d the best spot|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|vugraphzft: 2NT = short clubs (4531/4540)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave if S can find out his P having the @Dj orany of the black queens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The fire was not so big but could be put out pretty fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  the spade situation allows 3NT as well, but 4H looks like a great spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But there is the Chinese art of Wu Wei - acting by not acting. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this lead was not a success|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @d asking for longer major|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Killing lead = @H9 :)|pg||
nt|kattbridge: I guess Fredin finds it|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  With his reputation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That would be very interesting :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he has QJ103 in clubs -if he leads @h 9 I aprisiate|pg||
nt|po-s: he has done it from ace but declarer then put up king|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  so if he leads a club, ha can't have the @HA|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzft: 1@S-2NT, 4@H (void)-4NT, 5@H-6@S would be a rather standard sequence to the top spot|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so in a good day 6 @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: This has chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Declarer dont know who has the @DA so will maybe play for clubs|pg||
nt|oliverc: the only lead not to give a trick away, but East will be continually endplayed here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This looks just as good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not a good day|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not the most successful lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think south will bid 6@H to protect his @DKx or @CKxx depending on which ace is missing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and with 1 key card missing the side suit kings are vulnerable on the opening lead in a NT Contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At the other table slam was missed after a brave 2@D multi by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so 11 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|mrdct:  assuming 4@c was a cue, south knows that the missing keycard is the @DA as partner didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brave indeed... fortune favoured ..|pg||
nt|po-s: so question is  has he ever done it from queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  and could go down then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  easyer now |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzft: if South, like North, thought 4@H promised a void|pg||
nt|bt: hey just dont realize its a standard 3nt|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  Frederic decided he did'nt want to misguess|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petka:  after 2S and showing AKxxxx spades I guess she knows where the DA is :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So South should play another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup:  should duck first as cards lay-now 4-0 in trumps beats|pg||
nt|bt: they|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzft: i haven't had the chance to read what 3@D is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north is very weak for opening and south optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@C set @D, 4@D = minimum, 4@H RKC, 4NT = 1/4 and 5@C asked for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|bt: north has an opening hand in most systems, except roth-stone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6 imps went "Sivves" way when 2@H went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Many people tell me it's a make now, and I agree|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and look like a woman with the @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but clearly, this was enough as North risked a raise|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Perhaps W could find a double here to show real @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but we should remember we're seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|po-s: really|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang unhappy when the table came down|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|runnerup:  making contract found |pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzft: i think 3@D denied a void (therefore 4135)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  the play is slow from one table so we prob wont know the the result when play is finished here|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: in that case we'll keep table open|pg||
nt|kemperg: S took best chance|pg||

nt|baldfriede: W has a bomb shell fter partner S OPENING|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the 1@hx, I meant|pg||
nt|runnerup:  too late for @c .maybe if you start with @c you can beat that -ok partial figth here|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzft: routine 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess even slam might make with this incredibly lucky lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes.. 5-4 and 5 controls and Sis a 3rd hand opener|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Not the luckiest of breaks on this board either|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Will probably result in two down|pg||
nt|milton_se:  comes off cheap, though - just 150 or so|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2@H is ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs careful play however|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in 3 @c -fredin made he has halfly rigth he got 110 -but other table in 2@h ew and -300 so lost 5 imps anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|milton_se:  he knows theyÂ´re leading - OK to loose 5 but not 12 :)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mamos:  no chance for South to evalauate her hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: defense can take 5 tricks, but I have to see it:)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If I opened the n hand (which I would with some pds, not with others), I'd rebid 2@s.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kemperg: not brave:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: but none of the Wests in this match agreed with me as they both overcalled :)|pg||

nt|muppe: well, you could make 4M and then loose 12 also|pg||

nt|kemperg: cant miss 4@H here|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec told me that Ns hand are wourt 13,15 if u go at KNR. Agree him.|pg||
nt|kemperg: W could see 8 black tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have missed two games but did good on the slam hand|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very close match now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you open 2nt -minors and has no way to stop in 3 @c when partner is weak that is strange .speculiar -not common what ever you call it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  That defense probably will not make EW's career highlight reel.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  NS are due somewhere between 420 and 500 here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: San Sac stopped in 3NT and won 11 imps on the potential slam board|pg||
nt|muppe: unlikely though but possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Strong @C to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here EW in the open room did well to bid the cold 4@S, NS then took the sacrifice in 5@C for 300|pg||
nt|jcwla:  N may have a 5-over-5 decision and as usual it will be wrong to go on.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  surely wd -not the best lead but still was many dangers -here 4 @s and this vulnerability ew can to nothing over it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Larry Cohen has a great quote about how often it is wrong to bid 5 over 5 when you're thinking about it: "Yes, even this hand!"|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzft: i'm sorry for dozing off a little|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  hmm -yes makes ok|pg||

nt|wygbe1: looks like yet another 3n available for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Despite the miss a good board for EW|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would open @s hand here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzft: 1@D = 8 -11, 4M and 4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: S, not @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i prefer 3@D, assuming that is not strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT E here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13|pg||
mb|3D|nt|runnerup:  if nothing else -at least imtersting system -keeps you on your toes all the time |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Oy.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Was South invited to the party?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  they don't believe books or Cohen ..5 over 5|pg||
nt|jcwla:  "Who sent for you?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  He has no idea of what 4@Swas based on|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The preemptor's job after preempting is to allow it to do its work.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  In stony silence.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  pre-empter has time to go to toilet =pass ..but not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the fascinating thing about bidding 5 over 5 is that you tend to remember that 1 in 10 times it was right to do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as they are by the vul - non vul + stretched a bit:)|pg||
nt|po-s: are you sure?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: wow|pg||

nt|oliverc: .|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Hm, is it that cold on @h lead?|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi again all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: finesse diamonds and pitch a heart?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Four rounds of trumps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: They may land in 4@h though, with a loser in each suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South showed 12-14 bal. with 2 or 3 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North chose between pass and 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I'm pretty sure inviting game was not an option|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N cud have made a second bid as S confirmed 3 @Hs i thk|pg||
nt|mamos:  North's actions quite reasonable  Imagine p opened a weak NT  you would not want  to bid much with North|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores by the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South did not in any way promise 3@H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: with 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c asks if East has 4c supp|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes|pg||
nt|po-s: about 3 x clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They opened 2@D multi earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: oh 1@H cud be a doubleton?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, hard to fault norths pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, all the balanced 12-14:s bid 1@H if they don't have 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That would probably have lead to 4@s on NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East invited game with 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this might at least be a little interesting :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and when it comes to the bidding i prefer 1@S to 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 4-4 fit usually produces an extra trick and all that|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Is 7-1-4-1 a possible holding for the 3@S bid? Okay, then partner contemplated you might have it. If it's not, your bid was wrong to begin with.|pg||
nt|kattbridge: but does it show 6-5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: bidding I ment, but wiil make too|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B18 I was total wrong. 10IMP for Carbonnier and new leader again.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS agrees: "Don't try this at home"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oh, sorry PO :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: silence never won fair maiden|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|runnerup:  game is not good but makeable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a dbl of 1nt first and then bid my @Ds to show points and long @Ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  If you don't think 3@S is enough, then open 4@S, but don't open 3 and bid again|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Having said all that, I've seen many worse 5-over-5 bids than this. But this will be costly: -100 against +500.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzft: +300 in 4@S X won Scania 11 imps when matched up with +200 in 3@D X by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Pre-empting is all about quick in, quick out|pg||
nt|bt: three then a club i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or maybe three then a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove has moved past San Sac: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Still only 5.3 VP's between fourth and first|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  3@D will not make|pg||
nt|oliverc: fair enough, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 3 IMP's to your team? :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Automatic 1@h opener in Western Rabbit...|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I only believe in the Easter bunny :)|pg||
nt|milton_se:  Three teams within 1.3 VP's right now|pg||
nt|po-s: no, my fault, should have addressed Tjolpe|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, 20|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|baldfriede: it makes then, but it is not the same as "cold"|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for running scores|pg||
nt|friggi: has to play for 3-3 pk 36/7%|pg||
nt|baldfriede: as you see they only take 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but they aren't in 4, a bit different|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on a heart switch or lead in 4@S, that's your only shot|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: more imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|bt: ok, makes perfect sense|pg||
nt|bt: or not|pg||
nt|turnip1:  no, needed Jx or Jxx in diamonds North|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz2:  In Western Rabbit, all 10hcp are openers.  If you have a 4+card major you open in that regardless of minor suit length.  If 4-4 in the majors you open 1@h regardless of relative suit quality.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzeg: Disciplined pass på South|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT down when @H is played on time|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: both souths passed |pg||
nt|runnerup:  you cant see it ok looks strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A misguess in spades perhaps?|pg||

nt|runnerup:  up to 4-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: *by|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good result for Sivves from open room|pg||
nt|friggi: % wise not so good|pg||
nt|baldfriede: one does not finesse first round if finnesing 2nd roujnd is enough. that way you get a slightly increased chance if a singleton Q is behind you|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +620 is a nice result for Sivves from the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and again partial -nearly pass out hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will gain Hans-Ove some imps|pg||
nt|turnip1:  he could have made it this way though if N was void in diamonds...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@H was let through at the other table so Sivves won 13 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Tricky to find after an unnatural diamond opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and the championship|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  but surely it will be lattened at this table|pg||
nt|mamos:  flattened|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras won back 10 imps on  8 when they made 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: there is no complete record of the play but I think it was on a double squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's unfortunately not possible to view the bidding from the other table since we had to close down the vugraph|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But ending up in 3NT rather than 4@h was well done|pg||
nt|jcwla:  misguessed @S's in OR after losing two @C's and 1 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/83yevtx for running scores|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Now however, it's there|pg||
nt|muppe: does 2@s show both @s and @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes, it's natural with 5@d4@s|pg||
nt|milton_se:  must be so|pg||
nt|muppe: then N may compete to 4@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  @s lead beats also|pg||

nt|baldfriede: yes, that 3nt appears to very wobbly to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i am not so sure about that, could go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i predict a push on this board as well|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcwla:  Not sure why Upmark volunteered to raise a level against silent opps.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Seems like a hand you can choose what to do later, you are not in fear of anything they might do.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They now have a healthy lead of 1.5 vp|pg||
nt|bt: yes of course, i forgot that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: They might end up in 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: just to continue my streak of not bidding as the players, I consider that a 3@D opening :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: over an opening 3@D bid West wd bid @Cs and cross the 3nt level|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which would have made matters a lot worse for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: no way with 3 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: especially now on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  sorry i was looking at EW  cards   -- i hadnt got as far as looking at 5-0  break|pg||
nt|milton_se:  S should be short in @Hs to bid and Q@S is a good card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzft: Just like they did here|pg||
nt|muppe: wd NS|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nilsland:  It still can be decided at the third table :)|pg||

nt|oliverc: struggling to see 8 tricks here, let alone 9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nilsland:  3 @C is the contract you want to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@C = Gazili so 2@H = @H + @C|pg||
nt|oliverc: too much to do here, I suspect|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a loser in each suit perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but then again, it's important what partner will play you for|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|runnerup:  still a little chance to go off -@h guess -after @s Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you don't have to lose a spade|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Both sides are in for a surprise with a singleton K dropping|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: well a big swing in prospect, either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It was a hand similar to the s hand that allowed us to beat the mighty "Dallas Aces" in a short match in the 70s. We opened 1@h and got to 4@h vul, they opened 2@d  and played it there.  Everything broke and/or was onside and 4@h wrapped.|pg||
nt|bt: ns at the other table did really well getting to 4@H here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: isn't it likely that you lose two red tricks and two trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: correction, really well when it was making|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzeg: NS now tied for first|pg||
nt|wygbe1: could lose 2 diam ruffs, k of h, and club plus spade|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: So here we have the last board of this match. The second match will start 20:00 local time, in 1 1/2 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i also agree with the no|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) South's defence cost his team a lot|pg||
nt|mamos:  its been a great set of boards   lots and lots of close hands and some great play and some less great|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Okay, here we have the last board of this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A very quiet set this, impwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 14-10 to Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the slam of two aces was a push against 5@S -1 at the other table (after a club lead with South as declarer)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here we can see that we had an exotic bidding in the open room where North opened 2@C strong!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: last board for this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Ok, last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Seems like we'll make it on time despite the break for evacuation|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know ns system here but 3@H is a strange bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on this board Ragnarsson-Berg did well to reach the only game with a chance as the cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Okey, here comes the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Then we're ready for the very last match of the tournament where a lot is to decided|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nilsland:  Larsson - Bertheau bid and made 6 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thank you!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yeah, the last board for tonight coming up. Tomorrow we have another three matches for you|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, but I can't help feel that Ace and another Heart was indicated there|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the moral of this set seems to be -- play 3nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|friggi: I disagree - as a matter of desperation you should:)|pg||
nt|bt: ew got to 4@S here, nicely done, is this finally the hand fredin has been waiting for with all those ace leads against 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: It's far from over!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone for watching, thanks to the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +400 is a big result for Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|friggi: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a friend of mine once told me that it was often a good idea to redouble because it was much harder to defend then  the defenders were less confident and more likely to err|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine a 6 IMP swing to NS from here|pg||
nt|mamos:  its possible |pg||
nt|oliverc: possible but unlikely :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -this looks like 3nt ew so ew migth evenlise this match |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if Nopenened 2@C strong Sshd bid 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think maybe was some other meaning|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Was deliberate|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i checked with my sister (operator in the other room) and that was it meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he meant to open 2@D?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -partial again -bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Important decision to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: help BUT feel... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i just checked and it wasn't, declarer simply got 11 tricks when West ruffed air in clubs and cashed the ace of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS in the open room bid and made 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that's impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda currently has a small lead: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but three other teams have good chances at the gold medal as well|pg||
nt|milton_se:  y, but they only have 16-14 in reality|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup:  ctually 5 @D was off -but west helped -under leading @S ace was nothing but when he took 2 tricks by ruffing and @S Ace .his partner had Q and he 10 in @D if he sees to switch to @S his partner ruffs with Q and his 10 will beat 5 @D but no he|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a rather dull last board as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: great 4@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract looks like one down for 8 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|runnerup:  at board 8 -4 @s was made @d lead and small @d to get ruff(s) -not best idea -8 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or, now it's a make|pg||
nt|oliverc: or making|pg||
nt|turnip1:  just made...|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  switched to @d and 10 and Q fall together|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that is well done (lucky ) --this time @c well placed but still needs a lot to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla:  so at most 24 hcp no monster fit - pushy|pg||
nt|jcwla:  and the play was not commensurate w the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: .. and then you add about 3 point because you play on the Swedish national team :)|pg||
nt|bt: bad idea :) but if he doubles they might avoid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for the results, table will be kept open until we know who qualified|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Rodal and Ida|pg||
nt|runnerup:  she sorry |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@H is a rather good game here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: and of coarse the specs ty all|pg||
nt|oliverc: K@S was obviously singleton and Declarer cannot pick up Kxxx in the South hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: but 3NT on East has some play|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on a heart lead it's actually cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and West has shown 14-16 hcp with this sequence so he will at least make a move towards game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Gazilli coming up|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal game here |pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all-bye -some chances even for 170 here but surely 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Next we're broadcasting two of them, San Sac - Kamras|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back tomorrow at 10:00 local time, in roughly 10h30m|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 12 tricks with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: What what you guys have opened with the North hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  not this time -tx bye|pg||
nt|bt: maybe at some point ending the relays is possible?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang thought 2@C was Fourth Suit Forcing, Bergdahl that it was XY-Z|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzft: so Scania will win imps here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT as GF with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jcwla:  neither the extra @S nor the extra @C can yield a profitable @D pitch nor is there a @D ruff nor @H loser, all roads lead to rome|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h8|nt|turnip1:  4H maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that's my first choice as well|pg||
nt|turnip1:  But that could also be awful|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: of course :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So long for now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the slam dont make|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: we would like to thank Tofta Gård (our playing venue) for the magnificent service and help we've gotten|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West misinterpreted 2@D as GF facing all hands (the systematic meaning is that it's FG if West doesn't have the 14-16 hcp with 6@S)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which explains his raise|pg||
nt|kattbridge: good cardevaluation of bergdahl to stop this in 2@D|pg||
nt|runnerup:  you have entry problems after 3 times @s -if @h not 3-3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzft: South has found a great lead, let's see if they can follow up with a heart switch|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: S did well not to bid on|pg||
nt|baldfriede: double fame swing on the final board|pg||
nt|turnip1:  5 D making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: game*|pg||
nt|oliverc: why not? 5@D is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Thanks for joining us, Jordan|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the last board of today|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: * of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  should not make THAT IS:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on  6 NS overbid to 4@S going one down and thereby giving Sivves 5 imps|pg||
nt|mamos:  rapid tempo at this table = 12 boards in less than one hour|pg||
nt|oliverc: tough contract, this|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzft: thanks also to Roland and Markku|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And the specs :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|friggi: just becaus the K is on side|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so Larsson-Bertheau have a huge last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it's really necessary, this goes down unless they let declarer set up clubs (or spades)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Next 12 boards starts at 19:10, hence in 40 minutes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzft: North needs to switch the next time she's in but that shouldn't be impossible to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: actually it's rather clear by then|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Schedule will be slightly rearranged for the next segment|pg||
pc|s5|nt|runnerup:  west isn't very ambitious -pass to 1 @s isn't  everybodys choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But we'll soon be back with the second half!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kemperg: bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: U are right Germ. Sorry:(  Forgot the specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back at 9.00 tomorrow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thanks all!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|nilsland:  maybe some squeeze against N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: I accept that, but there's not much room for East to have the K@D after West opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so you don't want to be in a game on a finesse over an opening hand?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|friggi: my bid was 4NT|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|friggi: good @C and semi support|pg||
nt|friggi: can go very wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back at 14.45 with match 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Suz - Team Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: see you all then, bye for now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back 14.15|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzft: This is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The next match starts 19.30|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West managed to go down in this cold contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone! See you in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|stoffers: nordskjælland div?|pg||
nt|muppe: thx|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzft: In the next match we will broadcast Kamras vs. Team Zang|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: see you all then|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back in 30 mins with the remaining 12 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That's it for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back at 13.15 with the last half|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx bye|pg||
