nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  for running scores|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is because last year North here played in team Kamras|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: an intra finesse in trumps does the work if declarer can handle the rest|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: declarer went for the percentage play in trumps (if South had Kxx, low to the nine would have cost the contract) and went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back to Örebro where we're playing the third day out of four in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  We have a sign in the Copenhagen harbour, it reads: "Keep Denmark tidy, see a Swede to the ferry"|pg||

nt|baldfriede: and maybe N/S won't even be in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a grand, that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Playing a rather unusual system where pass is 0-7 or 17+|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzeg: another possible 3NT NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Dbl was for penalty according to East|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/BP.pdf for NS's CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: Possible as in "you make if you bid it"|pg||

nt|kemperg: dealer is not very kind for us:(|pg||
nt|baldfriede: though I would certainly clear my throat with some bid now as N|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Sundell.pdf is NS's|pg||
mb|4S|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) They play a short club with transfer responses and three weak twos|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract won't be pretty if Wrang finds a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it looks like they can take 6 red suit tricks, the ace of clubs and three trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that would be 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgi:  round 5 updated - http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Most play it as pass with spades, correct with hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: negative I think|pg||
nt|kemperg: as Roland explains|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  This is about to go 4 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  5@C does not make|pg||
nt|mamos:  what was 2@C?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd not bid 2@C here|pg||
nt|mamos:  strange|pg||
nt|baldfriede: neither would I|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or 10-12 with support|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Good a'noon Martin :)|pg||
nt|bt: presumably 2nt is 55+ majors or minors, south guessed which|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW use rather similar methods|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzft: Sorry?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I agree with the NT-opening, it might be wrong but it simplifies the auction so much|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: So we will now follow "The Fight of the Forcing Pass"|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  N-s would appear to lose a @s and a @c in any suit contrat.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is absolutely cold|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS  abit unlucky here in that South's values are mostly no help|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so a kind of garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|mamos:  garbage is the word|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky for south diamonds will be overruffed in dummy and hearts in hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that blew a trick (not that it was by any means strange)|pg||
nt|bt: and only one diamond cashes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: slam is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps, but it's not one you would like to be in|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos:  how would he proceed after 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you chose your third suit as trump that is|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Sundell knows that his p is short in @H... still a brave 3@C with his 4-3-3-3|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: before or after?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Director has been called|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: According to CC a normal weak 2:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/pekksalo1.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will lead to a 4-2 fit instead of a 4-4 one|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras has had a nice start here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: one down in a vulnerable game that could make and then +800|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: let's see if Scania can turn this around|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||
nt|mamos:  can they bid a slam from North|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d by n also available now|pg||
nt|mamos:  indeed mayne now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North has a very good hand for seing partner open 2@C gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang with a successful decision here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might push NS into 5@H down (it could also make)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @h needs careful play |pg||
nt|po-s: "making 12" gör jag som spelförare|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yet another 1NT-3NT with a 4c major. We've seen several of these auctions this weekend|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt:  40 and diamonds like that, hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT was good, a pen.dbl too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also 3nt sits|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ah, finally a CC which is in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... and this is two down misguessing spades, otherwise only one down|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Some players use 2@C as artifical but 2@D is normally nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 2@D wasn't making|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2 @D, 3 @S and 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so only a minor swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would guess he will finesse spades since it's an odds-on play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H showed a bad raise to 2@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's of course normal when 3433 |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess @C doubleton happens very rarely when u open 1@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but with an Ace i wd respond too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i don't really know their style but I think this is the only distribution when it's only two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: some pairs (including myself) open all balanced hands w/o a 5c M 1@C, then it's much more frequent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that may be and only occurs 3% of time, but that is not the reason pass is wrong|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner could have a huge hand where 4@H makes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|baldfriede: 6Nt wil be down though on a @c lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree Martin and the hands cud fit well with his 4-4 in the rounded suits|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hard to see any other than 140 here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wygbe1: good choice by north, protecting his club holding|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cuebids are fine but i thk S shd take control with rkc at some point|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5NT was RKC|pg||
nt|runnerup:  po-s idea north should tranfer to @c and suth with good hand bids 3 @c now south is declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Which is strengthed by North's explanations|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: fast claim here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i mean N can have a similar hand with the @Ca instead of the kj.. then 7 is cold|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but Sun does not know that... P cud hv @Cqx|pg||

mb|4H|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 10-13 opening once more|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 3@D by NS is likey down too. let us see|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Bennet and Bergdahl here are two of the more creative players in the tournament|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we can hope for some fireworks, if not on this board but maybe later :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos:  2@S will have attracted the best lead but I dont like bidding there on that|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: all about picking up clubs, which he will do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that brave 2@D bid has pushed E/W overboard here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@s being invitational with 5 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a figth .migth end on losing level|pg||
nt|bt: arent they already?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards don't sit nicely so 3nt migth fail -@d lead coming -perhaps helps but not enougth --but on 1- level no problems |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|mamos:  wow North has faith in his partner's NV overcall|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes but you have to make rigth thing to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|bt: i think ns did very well to find their fit here, lets see what he does. playing on diamonds after being shortened in dummy doesnt look likely|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nilsland:  So best in to play @H before taking the clubs - difficult thou|pg||
nt|mamos:  nope its pushed  NS overboard as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think North bid great, I wouldn't have overcalled 2@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos:  NS did need to get into the action somehow |pg||
nt|mamos:  but needed to know when to stop pushing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a balanced hand with 10 hcp is not a two level overcall, non-vul or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice low @S by Sundell|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Catastrophy stroke on board 2 for Adde when his partner had to play 3@S and went 4 down vulnerable|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: i think that's why he was upset|pg||
mb|p!|an|0-7/17+|mb|1S!|an|8-16, 4+|nt|vugraphzeg: has given me many spadeleads :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 1 game contract so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here EW makes 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 4@S for that matter|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Minors|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At board 3, Göran Adde found a protective 2NT holding 4-4 in the ms after 1@H-2@H which lead to 3@D -1 and 4 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|d|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a good spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: even though I can't see why they would end up there :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strait forfard game should be -but so i thougth also in last board that they try 3nt -but no|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This will be interesting|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ok, maybe not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but at least decent :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: won't make this time anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west in bidding his strength not his suits =support --|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, look at that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  new suit found on 4-level hmm|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange, 20 count bids once, his partner volunarily with 2 count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: def shd take the @D ruff and take this down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
nt|runnerup:  this bidding beats me |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Looks like a make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, now i have some back up for saying that Bennet is creative at least :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think declare should touch trumps here, might make anyway though|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bt: this wasnt the worst slam ever|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oliverc: no kidding|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hardly after this bidding|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but @d must be set up before the 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos:  he will havwe worries because if this finesse had failed and there been another force life might have got very sticky|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|oliverc: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @h marked with South for the opening... so best to run to dummy and take @H fin i thk|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Hk|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|po-s: ok, now he will probably go for D|pg||
nt|bt: a club finesse, club, then a diamond was the easy way|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu now in the lead since Grönkvist-Forsberg let 2@D through on 15|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h migth make -@s Ace and @s -KJ in @h and @d -@s ruff and more @d -now west out of @s -and makes -but not easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he could have ditched a club on the heart return though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: then pitch another on the queen later|pg||
nt|bt: he couldnt believe south had this huge hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|runnerup:  obviously 450 in this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The TD has been summoned|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: because of the alert/lack of alert of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that it showed spades has been proven|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bt: but this looks fine too|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|mamos:  whose fault it is is hard for us to say  not knowing their system  but it appears that N does not appreciate S;s playing strength|pg||

nt|rodal f: We see the cards. They don't.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  there was that michael's to help but still difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South is all to blame, she could have tried 3@H over 2NT or 3@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: because you said S was a she|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South is a female, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@D did not go only one down on board 4, it went three down doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: for a further pick-up of 12 imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Strääf didn't find a double in the same position as Wrang did (2@H-4@H) and that cost Zang 11 imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally we might see a game contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some discussion maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West thought 1@H showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was a normal contract and will potentially be 5 imps or so to Team Yoda|pg||
mb|1D!|an|8-16, 4+|nt|runnerup:  south will keep west out of @s so..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|po-s: 1NT?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not the best of slams here for  N/S, but it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so the case is now with the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll go on|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok thats why he bid 1nt -no support |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As you might have noticed EW play the most natural version of the forcing pass, letting all one openings be 4+ although limited|pg||
mb|d|nt|underdogg:  both pass and 1@c shows 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT   a possibility here |pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine how they can bid to 6@D, though|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he tried to bid as if he had opened 1@C|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzft: ... probably not|pg||
nt|po-s: how  do you make|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@c as respons to pass opening|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 3nt here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so moysian 2 @d which playes well|pg||
nt|bt: in theory south has a clear pass, partner couldnt act over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it explains that much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: so much for that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hey ns has found a game 2ntX-makes ---but south run |pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@d = 0-7 now|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@h 20+|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Just the auction s was hoping for.|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts will work but you may try spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  safe level 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@S is non-forcing, stronger hands would bid 1@H first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It takes finding the queen of trumps to make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup:  something to guess here -best if you find @h J |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 140?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not that obvious after the take out from West|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nilsland:  3NT was made by Larsson|pg||
nt|nilsland:  on the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she got a diamond-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not that it helps that much|pg||
pc|hT|nt|underdogg:  0-4/5-7bal 1@s|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c game forceing now from W|pg||
nt|runnerup:  open cards it is easy to beat by @d ruffs |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = @S, 1NT = 17-19 bal (upgraded)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once again east was too timid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @d small best now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry|pg||
nt|bt: can east be balanced?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: On  1, Hans-Ove won 5 imps for making 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores|pg||
nt|mamos:  WEst had a strong  hand  too strong to just bid game also  but you were right uncomfortable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but 5@D is also a make so EW will only lose an overtrick imp or so|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup:  but I am still wandering if pass to 1 @s gets better score |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: np, just wondered if you saw something I didn't :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos:  as long as they stop :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In case of doubt lead trumps.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  migth have been 80 -if 13. @d will have been switched in rigth moment but not now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so safe level was the idea|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oliverc: this looks to have been well judged by both pairs|pg||

nt|rodal f: OR play 2@S at B15. Looks like a 1IMPer for Scania.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: yes P is showing 16 to 19 and he should want to be in game if he is 17,18 or 19.. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: curtains|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this looks like one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and Wrang-Bergdahl have a huge set this far|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|mamos:  Yes  we seem to have reached the limit of the hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup:  declarer swets more if north leads @d J|pg||

nt|po-s: nord an sina färgbehandlingar|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: better odds for Hx than 9x|pg||
nt|baldfriede: which probably means "North and his handling of suits"|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you want to bid 2 @s -weak but partner opens --so cant you defende 1 @s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And he went down in a normal way|pg||
mb|p|an|0-7/ 17+|nt|runnerup:  this time 4-4 @s fit maybe not found -1 @h - !nt ..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this better be a game bid :)|pg||
mb|2N!|an|55+ any|nt|vugraphzeg: *less true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  ew may bid game here|pg||
nt|baldfriede: though I don't speak Swedish|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i gotta go now.. enjoy the rest of the session|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And we're back in the slam zone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it will be, i am betting my old slippers on it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  they probably play 1nt conventional|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt best here but may end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west can hold him self quited -he may have the previlise to defende not play @s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||
nt|bt:  you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65 for running scores of all matches|pg||
nt|bt: i agree on passing 1@S, but bergdahl rarely chooses the "normal" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both 6@D and 6@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Cards aren't situated brilliantly for EW|pg||
nt|bt: this is in sweden known as "polish scissors" 55any, less than an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont believe that ew will find @d -lets see|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Why shouldn't they? There is no point in playing 2NT now as natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: woho|pg||
pc|dA|nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thing is, this might now make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it can but line is far from obvious|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but here Scania can get some back|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i meant not|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sjöberg is taking the bull by the horns|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct:  well he has 8 certain tricks so choices are find the @H10 or the @CQ or let the opponents find one of those card for you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  coffee one /without this opening =2@h nothing to talk |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@SX would have costed.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup:  lets say well found 1 @S then|pg||
nt|runnerup:  rigth but average pair rarely has spoken these serious |pg||
nt|runnerup:  should of cource|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the Swedish Championship finals, average pairs shouldn't have come this far|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzft: and even without prior discussion you can calculate what it shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I am very surprised East passed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzft: well bid and a deserved make is what we can expected|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzft: North perhaps simply chose to make an overcall on his nice 4c suit|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I think finessing in @h won t help you much anyway|pg||
nt|bt: on board 3 yoda gained 11 imps, though there was possibly a tactical hesitation by north, so director is called|pg||
pc|sK|nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry but lets say you have to 'nose' these places|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @s is optimistic and was it nessessary for south to bid 2 @s -perhpas not|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was sugseeded that delayed raise shoe extra -this not -ok in that case 2 @s was the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang counted South for 4@S (he thought they played support redoubles)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  every time I try that -partner has xx and 7 points -and we play there insteadt of 1nt +1|pg||
