nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
pc|d3|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h6|nt|mamos:  and as the cards lie @cQ would have beaten 4@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
mb|1S|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||

nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||

nt|ady: a good swing here for North if resisting any save|pg||
nt|ady: surely wont  save with ace and king of clubs to defend|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Presumably N can correct 3@C to 3@D without showing extras|pg||

nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||

pc|s7|pc|cA|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|h6|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||

pc|sA|nt|STRIK3R: :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards, now @dJ and if it holds, a @c to @cQ and a @s finess....|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: I like Flott's line here, playing @C first|pg||

pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|STRIK3R: ups, bad guess :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||

pc|dA|nt|sverjohn: Yes, spade or diamond would have killed it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: North might have seen him self endplayed later on anyway, so the lead dident give it away, but would have made it easier|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4@s e/w and 5@h n/s on this hand|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: what do you prefer? 5@d or 4@H?... ehm 4@h out of the question now|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: E/W open lowest 4 card suit, can open 1@c with 4333 if the @s suit is poor|pg||
mb|2C|nt|gsper:  Does anyone know if the opening showed 5 cards?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s easy to bid|pg||

nt|sverjohn: Easy to bid, but maybe not easy to win|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||

pc|c2|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: when in with the ace of spades east will play a diamond|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an opener for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can make this on the lay   but I have my doubts    needs to play clubs twice   and gain entry on thir round   and finesse 10@S|pg||
nt|kemperg: as spec expected, 3NT or dbl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|STRIK3R: hard to make this|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: unlucky lead but doesn't give a trck directly|pg||

mb|p|nt|gsper:  Many would have opened 2NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  should West lead a top spade or a 4th best|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|murat e: an agressive pair may go on to slam here|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will likely reach 3NT|pg||

nt|ady: paertnership unserstanding    some lead 2nd highest|pg||
nt|mamos:  :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hasn´t N showed a red twosuiter?|pg||
nt|henryb:  A strange choice of actions by South|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|panosk: i think there are arguments on both sides, depends if you chose to downgrade (1NT) or upgrade (reverse 2@H), anyway Helgemo's opinion shud be respected|pg||
nt|bobholl: east has to guess who has t of @H|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: which Major to lead..|pg||
nt|ady: best lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit shy from Bakke|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: How can you be in bad shape if pard can bid 1 M? And if he bids 1 NT tou pass(he often have @C then) 1 NT can be a catastrofe when partner have under 6p and bad majors........I ...|pg||
nt|andersk: rest my case|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|djneill:  that would help, the @s8 is important not to waste|pg||
pc|d7|nt|murat e: 5-0 break in hearts make it impossible though|pg||
nt|ady: best to play queen  and a low club|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Nice bid by Jensen. Some would dream of 1-3-5-4 by pd and go further|pg||
pc|h3|nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed rigth|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok so East now knows West has 4 spades headed by nothing :-)  South cannot have more than 4 spades , so West has 4, per East|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: S ahs to win this and play spades to defeat |pg||
nt|panosk: *has|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @DA missing, it is difficult to do anything in @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe the @sT, East thinks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: may go down on this line|pg||
nt|ady: must resist a heart switch|pg||
nt|ady: continuation of spade   seems only 8 tricks  unless finessing club   unlikely play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: knowing E/W open on lowest 4 card suit, east is favourite to hold 4@h's?|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR W opened 1C, E had no problem to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: @C 10 convinient|pg||
nt|bobholl: NE now playing tic tac tor|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos:  we dont know what 3@h  meant  but seems likely to show red two suiter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with longer @d?|pg||
nt|mamos:  South's values dont look slammish|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  @s5 (no!)|pg||

nt|murat e: on a club lead declarer will first be happy and then a sad man.....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|STRIK3R: hard to get this right|pg||
nt|ady: even on a heart switch  still 1 trick short|pg||
nt|kemperg: to see bidding in OR hoover over the contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT just made (a push)|pg||
nt|bobholl: on board 9 the @H @S game S didn't lead his singleton so 4@S made|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gsper:  I would have banged down the @DA|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: assuming only 3 club tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead best against 3NT    but  around 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  wellSouth has pushed on to 5@s  which may be a mistake with the bad break - 4@s  might have made but 5@s looks too much|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||

nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: Sorry I dont have it in front om me|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w can make 6@H on the lay    but needs some luck |pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  15:45 according to BBO schedule|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: unless taking the @c finesse|pg||
nt|djneill:  wow 5@c other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andersk: 15.45 we start round 2|pg||
nt|ady: Bergen going to finish well ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: will show a balnced @H raise now i guess|pg||
nt|panosk: thx very much for watching, segment 2 of  this round is scheduled to start in 30 min or so, i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: link to running scoores : http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: for more detailed info about vugraph schedule check this BBO shcedule page here http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|panosk: times are always local, that is your time |pg||
nt|panosk: Kristoffer do tou have any link with latest standings pls|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 5@D makes more sens|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panosk: 15.45 according to schedule, 18.15 is last broadcast of today|pg||
nt|djneill:  should East go on?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Took the save before e-w could find their potential. Might reach 6 h here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: after 4@d|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@s looks ok|pg||
nt|ady: need to bid the slam for a plus on this hand for Drammen|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: thats 50 minutes from now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: making there as well, @h lead from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|panosk: so plenty more action to come|pg||
nt|bobholl: will become a push unless @H guess goes wrong|pg||
nt|mamos:  one that got away  both ways|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|murat e: spade lead was better here|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and miss guess can beat 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Looks like Helgemo will gain 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andersk: @H A now and Helgemo will gain 3 IMP|pg||
nt|panosk: true but i think will be ducked|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||
nt|murat e: with helgemo playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: thx vm Kristoffer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill:  looks like it plays like a double-squeeze even if plays 3 hearts, unless they force out the @d entry early|pg||
nt|ady: once the spade loser is thrown on K@C   east will draw 2 trumps   and play diamonds ruffing the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board thanks to ouroperator Robert Althe and all kibs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
nt|panosk: 3 imps it is |pg||
nt|ady: best lead    but looks a push with 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think so too|pg||
nt|sverjohn: can not go wrong now|pg||
