mb|2D|mb|d|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  North might show a good raise this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2NT might just be a good 4-card raise on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  with a heart stop :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: John says 2N is natural and forcing, but he's taken option to pass?|pg||
nt|paulg:  John has espoused this concept before, of course North is a passed hand here|pg||
nt|paulg:  so is limited|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  excellent lead and the defence does not look too difficult|pg||
nt|paulg:  East is not going to keep many hearts on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|golfsquash: This could be 4 down if the heart is finessed early|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: North giving this some thought|pg||

nt|paulg:  since Sime seems to have done enough to reach it|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: 2@h is reversing, 3@c is 4th suit forcing - 2N would have been weak after the reverse|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  Methods make a big difference here and I'm not sure what the fourth-suit 3@c bid showed|pg||
