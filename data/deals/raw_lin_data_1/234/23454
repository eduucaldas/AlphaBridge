pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing precision or some other limited system?  If not, 4@h seems a little premature.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think a club system |pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: take out double by east?|pg||

nt|kemperg: on 5 in 3NT now|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very... interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@D opening there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a bid tricky |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: 2NT????|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems pre-destined here|pg||
nt|peacokk: Looks like NS will have an easy auction to 4@H after a strong @C-opening|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|santyclz: X?|pg||
mb|1S!|an|8+ hcp, 5+!h|nt|penseur9: ok 2@C is go for|pg||
nt|pelu:  this time the black Kings onside|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8-11 opening|pg||
nt|murat e: good evening erik hi roland|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@S = FG 5+@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andreasw:  3@s is the limit for N-S here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Presumably x is takeout.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  after east opening bid 3nt looks nice -but @s finess off and this 22 points 3nt would fail -of course in is not biddable and west in with 2 @s now so other story|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||
nt|santyclz: And don't forget that pd opened in 3rd seat so may have a sub-minimal hand with short @ss.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: Oh my.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: with the potential ruffs by W |pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -on 1 level @s is ok -but 2 -level and strong hand behind partners -poss weak opening so pass is my tips|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bds running flat|pg||
nt|ady: last hand  n/s can make 4@H  on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to bid it though|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  anyone for 2@s here? .. Show your decent 6 carder or show your 4 card support?|pg||
nt|ady: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they also make 3N on non @D lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: S was a little pessimistic for imps last hand I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now can make 7 |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  2Nt sh never be the final contract :)|pg||
nt|murat e: its good you came imps are flying around and i am alone here....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: S didn't show  primary support of n (unless their x is abnormal), and n never began to show his hand.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andreasw:  im guessing this will be -1:) unless Stokka can guess @s K|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|peacokk: Im not sure why Hernebrink tried 1NT, looks pointless to me.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|penseur9: I think east took 3@C as singleton or void|pg||
nt|penseur9: yet 4@S should make|pg||
nt|friggi: sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: play is interesting may well play a spade to the J!?|pg||
nt|mcphee: should run 10@D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S for 1 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|penseur9: maybe +2 on @S finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: @D suit hidden, and I wonder what 3 or 4 @D would have been by N |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is similar to the last board where with primary support n x'd an overcall instead of showing support.  A very difficult way to play.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might play neg frees |pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu:  @cxK in S = 7 tricks - in N = 9 tricks - so NEVER 2NT|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|santyclz: In spite of all our dire comments, w can get out for -1 on good guessing.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|penseur9: looking like -1|pg||
nt|pelu:  2Nt = a fly-terminal - u go there to find yout next destination :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Topping the @s like a boss.. now topping @d aswell?|pg||
nt|penseur9: what do I know :)|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer can still take the heart finesse but 9 spot dropping from west he will be suspicious|pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9: there we go|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andreasw:  nice play! 10 tricks|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: will probably settle for his top tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok every now and then you find partners hand is nice for your cards .but in a long run not so nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: i favor playing on @D before @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: not the best defense:(|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andreasw:  William tell them to slow down a bid! they are all playing insanely fast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but the spade play is tempting|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he has a problem with 5-3 on that line|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H that is|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Brogeland got on the board when EMA x'd 5@s at the other table.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|penseur9: running the @D would have been +2|pg||
nt|penseur9: now +1|pg||
nt|mcphee: when the opps discards can help you usually it is a good idea to see what they are|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andreasw:  Wd:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzaf: i have no time answering you, as u said, they play insanly fast.|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: S admits that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|murat e: this board is a possible win for brogeland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|penseur9: big swing on 21 for Brogelend  ... OR in 3nt making for 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|pelu:  u sh buy a new calculator - I told u :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@h SEEMS INEVITABLE|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: is this a wk NT or 14-16 15-17?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: i think 14-16|pg||
nt|mcphee: good raise from W|pg||
mb|5S|nt|penseur9: :))))|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: any shapey 10 count |pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: I became uncertain but there were really 6 more tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: In his own (Swedish) words: "Hjärnsläpp".|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@d = @d+M|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 4 hearts makes and 4 spades went undoubled in the other room|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 14-16 is correct|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzaf: :) me included|pg||
nt|roswolf: support with support - usually is winning bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S was a bit wild|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 3 down this time|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: unilateral 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|murat e: surprisingly no dbl here as well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andreasw:  After partners pass i like 1@s more.. here it worked good though.. 2@s should be -1 with right defence while with the lead 1!N is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: N has shown 14-16 6c@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: If s has the j (as happened), ruffing with the 8 gains a trick.  If n has the j it doesn't matter with which you ruff,  the j is going to score.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|runnerup:  west choice was pass -helped east life but many would double -inspite of 4 @s |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: but ti worked|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|penseur9: 1NT should make but hard to predict the play at 1 level|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hT|pc|cT|pg||
nt|santyclz: The defenders need to get a trump promotion to set up a 2nd undertrick.|pg||
nt|kemperg: needed @D lead to defeat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: 4 hearts does make   so 3 down ok|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|peacokk: yes, I think Andersson should have bid 5@C on the way to make sure he get's a @C-lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|kemperg: now @C to discard @DQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s5|nt|roswolf: a random 3 imp swing|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Right.  This wasn't the way to get it.  Can make now.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW get 34.6 IMPs every time they start a 32-board session. So they will get another 34.6 before the 7th in 2 weeks when they play the last 32|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: if they are lucky|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: might have to duck a club though on a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: now should make|pg||
nt|murat e: north is a brave man i would be afraid to dbl this since partner is a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: killing lead from S|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h7|nt|runnerup:  5 @c proofed to be too difficult (and i dont say that you can make-perhaps dd -but not so sure about that either  )  because @c 4-1 -so board 6 was a push |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: interesting   on a trump lead  if a club is ducked the defence may need to force dummy with spades   may still go down|pg||

pc|h4|nt|penseur9: @S lead might create problems|pg||
nt|penseur9: contract on a @H finesse, will he play it right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: what?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzaf: That's right|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@H because I p;lay the hands great?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat e: say east doubles three clubs which is better hand pass or 3 hearts.......|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|kemperg: @H lead was down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: really 5@H undoubled|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|runnerup:  board 11 was a double game swing for Brogeland |pg||
pc|cA|nt|penseur9: up to now a fantastic segment for The Brogeland team|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|friggi: I would|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Bd 11, the 4@s contract that squeaked by, was played at 3nt by s at the other table for -400 and a 13 imp swing.|pg||
nt|murat e: this is an area where casual partnerships forget to talk about|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: Sorry, for +400!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|friggi: percet right play'|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: system worked well here, no need for E to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|pelu:  only a @h-lead could defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: There's still room for mistakes, but I don't think Staffan will make any.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|h9|mc|10|nt|penseur9: going down now I think|pg||
nt|friggi: decl doing good joj|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|penseur9: 4 more boards to compare, but one to play here|pg||
nt|kemperg: last bord, another @D suit, trump as Roland says|pg||
nt|murat e: finally a grand to finish this amusing set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S has the trash, wants to raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm what is south thinking about|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: a dead grand slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S displays the STOP card. :)|pg||
nt|peacokk: Easier for NS in other room after a natural 1@D-opening, lets see if NS here can find 7@D as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: we should thank Magnus Holmgren, our fine operator for a job well done...|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: short suit trial bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: north's imagination runninf riot|pg||

nt|roswolf: that is not imaginative just off this planet|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: This might turn now for EMA|pg||
nt|murat e: even down maybe|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup:  ew makes @h game so ns must bid 4 @s over that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu:  and the card-dealer for a set of very interesting hands|pg||
nt|penseur9: I also wish to thank Peter and Germ with their new ca;culators (I have one on order :) ) for their excellent commenting...|pg||

nt|penseur9: this round was all Brogeland... they are to be congratulated...|pg||
nt|kemperg: close match again:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|pelu:  a weak 2 from W (2@D multi) maded life harder for nS in CR|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Trump lead might have sunk this.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps north should have bid more than 2 @s with 4 good @s .but south raised 4 @s out of bidding bix -now ...ok this makes after @s lead|pg||
nt|friggi: dontbe offenfiveþ... Frace.. be polite|pg||
nt|murat e: hard to play this one quick claim is better|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu:  ??|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|runnerup:  looks makeable after any lead but you surely dont want to be on 5-level -have to play tongue in the middle of your mouth as they say|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad, couold have made it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu:  so almost 60 IMP to Brogeland|pg||

mc|8|nt|murat e: thx all 2 more sets in this exciting match|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Big misunderstanding there, as you can imagine.|pg||
nt|adonis18:  The @d suit seems to be lost in many games|pg||
nt|adonis18:  how could s pass 3 ut?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: I didn't quite follow, but according to N he had shown his @d but his partner didn't know that.|pg||
nt|adonis18:  well bid at the other table:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Well, that's all for now. EMA still in the lead when we return for the last two segments next week.|pg||
