nt|bigtrain: n/s play 2/1 with gadgets|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: looks like the other room went down in 3NT which i beieve can be made|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bigtrain: what happened with the scoring?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S is multi meaning|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D shows short @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|3for3: Is this the correct score?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: henry do you have any idea how this score was handled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: W is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: It was tied on vugraph after 105, but that is unofficial|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: seems unlikely, unless there was some massive adjustment on appeal|pg||

pc|c5|nt|vugraphzfk: appeal changed to 2HXX down 1|pg||
nt|3for3: so, shouldnt that mean nickell leads?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but that should mean nickell is leading|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it should|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: ibelieve that nickell is up 11 or 12|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think the score is reversed here|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a differing explanation on an alertable call, and the ruling changed the score from plus 300 for spector, to 200 for nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i believe that is correct but I will try to change score in a minute|pg||
nt|dburn: but this looks like a losing position for Nickell - 3NT would have made, but 5@c almost certainly will not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the score  heard|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: Play is at tric 9..i will report result in a min|pg||
nt|3for3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem was in the open room they cashed the hearts and lost communication for the squeeze to work|pg||
nt|3for3: seems like that adjustment should be 12, not 21...|pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: 5d asked for kings|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk2:  heart, spade back|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobh1: kibs are taking both sides of this one|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobh1: Zia @C play is not popular with the naysayers|pg||
nt|algraves:  easier when you can see all 4 hands and are in the back row|pg||
nt|bobh1: of course we can all see much more of the deal than Zia can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but that is the kibitizers long held right|pg||
nt|algraves:  without Oscar the Owl the game would be poorer|pg||
nt|bobh1: Zia plays MUD it appears|pg||
nt|bobh1: this may be a source of confusion for Joel|pg||
nt|bobh1: normally a player leading the 5 then playing the 9 would have the Q|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a timed event but long pauses for thought are normal and permitted|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they start to add up, the director starts getting nasty|pg||
nt|algraves:  Well Woldridge can build a club trick with the right view but that is hardly clear|pg||
nt|bobh1: no timers...if the table is slow, then we start arguing about whose fault it was|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  And you can deny declarer access to dummy to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: he goggled the answer :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i couldn't stand the strain of waiting :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: once Zia led @C (and not @HK), he is doing best to continue - and force declarer's @C decision immediatelly (he may have led from Q95(2)) ... after all, East did not Dble 4@S ... ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: and he is "known" to have probably @HQ (no @H lead) and 5 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: right walter|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: ...if anyone actually led a heart, his copy of the hand records should gently be removed from him before allowing play to continue|pg||

nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||

nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2nd on Roland's list of terrible bridge terms|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzfk: from declarer;s perspective..club length is unknown after 1d opener|pg||
nt|barnets: if declarer ducks a club east might shift to a spade and  may possibly set up one club 2 diamonds one heart and one spade trick for the defense|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes although that was not a minimum hand with two tens and 2 Aces, 2Kings and a working j|pg||
nt|algraves:  certinaly suited for play in Hearts though, the classic 4-3 fit type hand , strong trumps and prime cards outside|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: Yes. I think it was mostly the spade holding that deterred Meckstroth from 1NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  to facilitate ruffing in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 49: wd Meckstroth anyway|pg||
nt|3for3: no alert, but we can assume zias 3@C was preemptive/mixed|pg||
nt|dburn: luckily for Nickell, neither of those superb players is qualified to play in the US trials - still, there are doubtless some vacant properties still in Monaco|pg||
nt|3for3: this 3nt looks flat|pg||

nt|ritong: welcome to cornel teodorescu|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|algraves:  My Mom would bring this in, with her only consistent line of play|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm this is a bit interesting|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to go over to dummy and finesse hearts to keep east off lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sry put contract i to follow play|pg||
nt|athene: but if he cashes the @DQ whilst he is there, he sets up diamond tricks and an entry for east|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: msy make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|leroumain: ty:)|pg||
nt|gheo1954: E paseaza cu un prelung oftat|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: maybe he will now decide he has to just bash out hearts from the top|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really make use of the @h98|pg||
nt|athene: for example club to king, heart to jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Cheek thinking|pg||
nt|athene: because if that finesse lost, a club return would tangle your entries|pg||
nt|barnets:  he may x to dummy and lead the @H 8 to the J|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe you can do that, and then duck if west wins and shifts to a club|pg||
nt|barnets:  ibut a club retun hurts transport here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|algraves:  Hurd is a terrific player , dont get me wrong, but at some point.... as I said. It is a good debate when the stakes are 4-6 imps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|algraves:  which was to pull trump and take whatever finesses were about|pg||
nt|ady: a squeeze materialised on east|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|algraves:  on this hand there are none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe at this point he is regretting ducking the first trick as it gives him slightly less elbow-room for a throw-in ending|pg||
nt|athene: but he was not sure spades were 6-1, meckstroth being in first seat at favourable, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets:  he could duck it thouhgh|pg||

nt|3for3: good slam here|pg||
nt|bebechira: asa ca daca doriti sa comentati in romaneste....please go-ahead :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: Wooldridge is light but that is the modern style especially with a decent major|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes Peter , very difficult sometimes for our operators to see exactly what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  and 9 for NS in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bridgwinners website, about 70% of readers picked Spector to win this match. I was in the minority when I voted for Nickell to win. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|gheo1954: inca o dona unde se da lupta pentru partiala. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: this shows about 22-23|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - may not be so easy to bid, but Hurd and Wooldridge may have the right set of spanners|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: sorry, wrenches|pg||
nt|gheo1954: curat pasul|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobh1: a @s lead gives the 9th trick|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems hard to resist|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually E can set up @Ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Undo please|pg||
nt|3for3: undo|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  West passed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves:  Those tables that automatically read the cards are a nice advance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: Heading for 6@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  have they worked out the kinks in that technology?|pg||
nt|petergill: No ruff, so will make|pg||
nt|petergill: Not yet, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar   playing precision but not transfers in comp     Kx  QJ  J9xx QT8xx   1@H-(DBL)-?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that wasn't meant for the room|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@C likely 'serious' slam try|pg||
nt|leroumain: 4@h+1  e cam tare|pg||
nt|carkim: cum ramane mai tamas cu forma lui flota?|pg||
nt|carkim: cu alea 2 carale pas pas pas|pg||
nt|gheo1954: zici de 2 carale+4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia cannot ask for @HQ, has a problem|pg||
nt|petergill: so Is using 5@S queen ask to detemine whether to play 6@H or 6NT|pg||
nt|athene: double-dummy you can make this of course, but in practice i think it will go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Eric tanking|pg||
nt|athene: probably going to lose a diamond, two hearts and one or even two trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: i had many ims about the last hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: if the play was as recorded south would have made it had he ducked the @CJ|pg||
nt|ady: east suitable with not much in spades opposite a likely shortage|pg||
nt|dburn: not obvious what the right line is on a passive lead, but everything rational will work|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: nice easy hand to play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: n/s kept out of the bidding    in fact only 8 tricks in spades with the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|petergill: normally 5@S (if queen ask) shows all keycards, but here Zia knows that Hamman cannot bid 7@h, having limited his hand via 2NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: da... ma intrebabm cum s-au facut 11 levate..dar m-am uitat la film si m-am lamurit :)|pg||
nt|gheo1954: e simplu flotza juca con XYZ costache nu LOL|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 4@S contract went down in the other room so the match tightens up|pg||
nt|algraves:  not sure. one of lifes mysteries, |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT natural, GF|pg||
nt|3for3: i guess you can probably make 7 looking at all of the hands|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|ady: e/w  kept out sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: sometimes 5@S is to play on auctions like this one|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess you can - East may be squeezable in three suits|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: had he won the club ace he was down|pg||
nt|leroumain: in mod normal-1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|3for3: he is|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer, with only eleven top tricks in six, may take some time over the play|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond jack lead, one of the spex suggests!|pg||
nt|bebechira: in mod normal ar trebui sa mai cedeze 3 cupe acum..dar.....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|3for3: that might be his partner's choice tho :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: so we dont really know what happened|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: this will be quick now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|algraves:  on board 20 he had a winning position as the defense went and of course brought it home|pg||
nt|bobh1: hamman figured out the @D layout|pg||
nt|3for3: this will speed things up|pg||
pc|c6|nt|leroumain: le poate face daca joaca @d mic la levata 3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: now to pick up the trumps, without any other factors, you have to decide whether to cash the ace or jack|pg||
nt|athene: @SK10xx and singleton x is more likely than @S10xxx and singleton king|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: because there are three small singletons and only one king|pg||
nt|athene: so he might lose to the @S10 as well|pg||
nt|athene: someone is asking about the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Karodan 4löve yettiði için 2. karoyu býraktý|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: fakat J geldikten sonra 4-1 karoya önleme gerek yoktu|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: likely flat, because Meckwell have lots of wrenches, but still...|pg||
nt|3for3: featherweight opening by hurd|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he likes his shape and good spot cards|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly a Mike Tyson overcall by Hamman either|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D a fit jump, likely|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S will be too|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d must be something special - can't believe it's just diamonds and clubs; what about hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i can't see what was written|pg||
mb|1S|nt|efrahim: JTxx içeride bile olsa büyük karo onörüne afiþe olacak ve 8liyle empas yapýlacak|pg||
nt|1mavzer: 1spye pas yok mu acaba?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: how about x for the flexibility|pg||
mb|2D|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i took care of it :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 pici au fost optimiste :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is not a success n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: favorable|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to chance a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 6@d deklare edilebilirse East West çiftinin moralleri yükselebilir|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Rodwell did not have weak 2@D in arsenal    they play 2@D opener = 3-suit short @D|pg||

nt|ady: then switch to a club|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|barnets: after easts 4@D pick a major perhaps west should have bid spades at the 4 level|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: declarer will need to go up with A@C  and get spade right to make 9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: will probably draw 3 rounds of trumps  and trust to good fortune in hearts   |pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South had a tough bid - Axx in clubs looks poor for 1NT because|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since with 55 or 65 he bids 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek hopes that Grue has similiar spades as last hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: 4@c neydi diye sordu, Serap Kuranoðlu blokatif olarak alert etti|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: which they don't, of course|pg||

nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||

nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||

nt|algraves:  at the other table declarer did take a more complex line of play on 38 and this time, the simple line was best|pg||
nt|algraves:  note that Souths entire auction was pointed towards 3NT by his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening bid structure is identical for both pairs|pg||

nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: They will probably avoid 6@H if they find they lack an ace plus @HQ |pg||
nt|ady: typical flat 11 opening these days|pg||
nt|bebechira: 1 pica|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: Grue has a secret weapon to defenc 3NT   and 3 spades looks difficult|pg||
nt|algraves:  and if possible any positional considerations|pg||
nt|barnets: in 2@HXX defense have to be careful to actually beat it|pg||
nt|dburn: I make it 11/12ths of the 2-2 breaks and 1/4th of the 3-1s, and I am too tired to do that in my head but I believe it to be less than 50%|pg||

nt|barnets: 4! down 1 on ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S down on ruff|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes I think the logic of 4@S is clearly a big diamond fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cn tap declarer out also|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but South was not on the same page presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: there;s no certainty,, but the odds are good..rodwell can overtake and play d..he should suspect ns diamond fit for 4s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: if clubs are continued, meck can make a similar judgement based on the auction and club shortage in N|pg||
nt|nightbell: +1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: spector doing well this session   might get more imps here|pg||
nt|barnets: this will likely make just 7 tricks|pg||

nt|3for3: tho a spade will lead to a quick set far more often....|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: South seems to have bid out his shape. I'm not sure what the bids at the 3 level mean|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room west opened 1@H and this made it more difficult|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: hurd is thinking about the hand not this trick|pg||
nt|3for3: might be thinking where to win this trick :)|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, they are rattling through the deals here but the other room are no slowcoaches - Meckwell flattened 6@s and won 2 IMPs for playing 5@h where Zia might have beaten 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: probably should win in hand and lead small spade for maximum possibilities..of course everything works|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 5! had eleven on top exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, 5@h|pg||
nt|3for3: For those who missed last set, there is a potential appeal that would be worth 11 imps to Spector.  Differing explanations on opposite sides of screen.|pg||
nt|dburn: very tough hand for Hurd at the table - easy for us, but he will be thinking "what can I do if the diamonds don't run? what if West has the @sK?"|pg||
pc|s8|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|3for3: doesnt he have 9 sure ones?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||

nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|c7|nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes it is a little more because you have 9 trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: while the bring 680 happens|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes less when you have 8 trumps and " handling charges "|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @HK guareentees 9 tricks|pg||

nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||

nt|gheo1954: offf|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
nt|dburn: and unless Hurd makes a somewhat unlikely seven overtricks here, plus 300 North-South will score pretty well|pg||

nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
pc|h9|nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
nt|gheo1954: lacomia|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: grue penalized for super light opening.|pg||
nt|3for3: Of couse, a spectator notes that if he had rebid 2@C....|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that would have been Gazzilli, or some such - no one has voluntarily bid clubs to show clubs since about 1983|pg||
nt|3for3: I suspect he didnt relish the though of a preference to his 98653 of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: not gazilli|pg||
nt|3for3: they do the big club thing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||

nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Diamond trashing Jacobs  +62 with 3 to play in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: zia wanted to bid clubs..but that will just force ns into diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: i am a trader, what can i say|pg||
nt|bebechira: comentariul in romaneste a adus spectatori mai multi in closed room decat in open room..... pana acum toate seturile a fost invers :)|pg||
nt|gheo1954: nu era un slem foarte bun dar de dragul spectacolului mergea zis. asa pentru fani din balcon|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: i reckon the generator loves diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Bu setin son eli|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Mehmet aydýnýn uyandýrmasý selçuk üniversitesine 6imp kazandýrdý|pg||
nt|1mavzer: bu bord güzel geçebilir|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: nice try in the auction by Grue|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c doubled might, it seems to me, have been down two|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: another long spade suit for Grue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: 3 more imps to the leaders when 1N went down only 1 in the other room|pg||
nt|algraves:  bridge is full of nasty guesses and lucky bounces|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = NF|pg||
nt|3for3: sry private|pg||
nt|gheo1954: era o solutie sa pui A de trefla si sa nu te repezi cu taiul ca mutu ci sa joci Q de pica. foarte simplu|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: e/w  have game in diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes Grue has won the Spade cup so far |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: will rodwell find a diamond lead against 3nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: problematic for Wooldridge, who would like to support diamonds vigorously and show spades also|pg||
nt|bebechira: este 2 noaptea aici.. va las si sanatate la toata lumea :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: multumim pentru comentarii|pg||
nt|efrahim: 1nt üzerine 4 ve 13 numaralarý bordlarda pas ile deklere vermek arasýndaki farklar görülüyor .. iki el de kitabi deðil fakat pas yerine konuþmayý seçmek farklý takýmlara da olsa 2 ...|pg||
nt|efrahim: bordda da kazandýrdý|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: tHrashing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H transfer to 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: looks a bit impossible to me|pg||
nt|dburn: if this is forcing, OK, but if it isn't it might end the NS auction|pg||
nt|dburn: but now South may feel in duty bound to support diamonds, which as far as I can see he has not yet done|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he never supported @D|pg||
nt|barnets: diamond lead and spade switch|pg||
nt|bebechira: great job Raluca ....bye all|pg||
nt|gheo1954: dar tot juste le facea ca stie jocul :)|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 2NT : Lebensohl herhalde|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C game force promises either 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not good enough anyway but it would give declarer a nasty moment|pg||
nt|leroumain: dupa ce dadea 2@s si 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  es I think he wanted the @S trick now and wanted an entry to hand to deal with trumps eventually and just as you say, so as not to have to broach diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D transfer|pg||
nt|3for3: oooh, i thought spector was going to play the same contract at both tables for a second|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that line was a result of Larry Cohen's book on Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used bad instead of new math    Diamond +78|pg||
nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Oktayýn DBL iyi deðil, 3@h-4@h gibi birþey demeli|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
nt|leroumain: lucky 3nt in loc de 4@h|pg||
nt|1mavzer: 4 kör yaplýabilir gözüksede oynamasý oldukça zor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bu elle bu kadar pasif kalýnmaz|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South could double (which shows spades and tolerance for diamonds) and then bid diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vahaboglu: ortaða güveniyorsan 4@h iyi|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves:  on a good day this makes.|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: kendine güveniyorsan 3@h :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves:  but this is not a good day|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|algraves:  at least this little part of the day|pg||
nt|barnets: now down 1|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would like to eliminate the diamonds before playing trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule showing local timezone of VIEWER  via  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more 15-board sets remain to determine Semi-Finalists|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nice result in open room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: then after east got his ruff he would be endplayed|pg||
nt|efrahim: Atilla Bey'in dekleresi 15 imp gerideki deðil 15 imp öndeki takýmýn dekleresi (cezasýz oynatmak)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d9|nt|algraves:  What do EW make in @D ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 split  makes life a bit more difficult   but 11 tricks looks ok|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes one way or another|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 7'liyi iyi buldu akgün|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 2@s konturlu +2 nin etkisi olabilir :) |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but sadly dummy does not have an entry for the second diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|1mavzer: dam tek diye düþünmez |pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board for this fast table|pg||
nt|bombacii: 7 liyi gecen @s markasý yok,sadece 6 lý dýsarda,5 tane karosu 2 tane @h u var|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|ady: K@H lead might make 5@D difficult|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue, who stuck his neck a long way out with 2@s and was lucky not to be handed his head, did remarkably well to go down only one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great harm done - no one could take a swing at four diamonds, so Spector will win an IMP or two|pg||
nt|bombacii: 5 tane @c gozukuyo sanki|pg||
pc|sK|nt|3for3: not a friendly lie, this will fail, pushing the nickell lead to the 20s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfk: it won;t matter if this score stands|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bombacii: 6-4 de olabilir|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|1mavzer: 12.15 de görüþmek üzere|pg||
nt|1mavzer: eline saðlýk erkmen|pg||
