nt|golfsquash: Pass is the winnig action, but hard to find it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: bidding 2 with out the a or k of hearts but you have both |pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  B25 came in with an overtrick swing to England, and B26 gave 3 more imps|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  to England when the 2@H with QJ9632 opposite singleton 5 went 2 off (here 1 off)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  GB (not England, sorry) are now 7 imps ahead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  B29|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  this was the first board played in the other room, and S played 3N two off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|capercliff: I can count 9 tricks in @s's for E/W|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  with 24 hcp between the two hands the contract is not unexpected|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  the very poor spade spots plus the notrumpish nature of the heart suit have led East to pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  I transfer when my partner has four|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not before the defence takes 5 or so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|golfsquash: the killing lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it started with a diamodn lead but then a heart switch in the other room|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and the defence get two aces and three hearts; the "easy" defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has 5 top tricks and so should escape for 2 down, holding the loss to 1 IMP|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3Nt a fair vulnerable game but failing with the @cA offside|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|pjs_ch:  in the other room meant declarer had 5 red suit tricks when he got in,|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and he could not try to make his contract my playing clubs, so he|pg||
nt|golfsquash: it was a very good heart switch|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|pjs_ch:  lsot the @CQ also;  here the more accurate (?), pointed (?) defence|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  did he really do that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: all of this to take losing ht finesse?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzeb: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hoping for hearts 3-6 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then West will have no heart to lead after taking the third round of clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pjs_ch:  doesn't give declarer that extra losing option - they will cash the @SA I am sure|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in which case it is obvious to hold up now - so why the pause?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|capercliff: its a double finesse really|pg||
