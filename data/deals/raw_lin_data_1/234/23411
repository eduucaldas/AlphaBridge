nt|ram6: Apparently a breach of the rules, but it was reasonable|pg||

nt|ram6: and East didn't see any chance for a slam with his club singelton, bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|ram6: opening 1NT with 6 clubs not that clever, better let partner know what is your long suit|pg||

nt|ram6: Doron wanted to keep hearts as an option|pg||
nt|ram6: 2@C showed diamonds|pg||
mb|6C|mb|d|nt|ram6: the use of a transfer after double enables to show a suit with both a weak and a strong hand|pg||

nt|ram6: Even if you open very light, you must trust partner's penalty doubles|pg||
