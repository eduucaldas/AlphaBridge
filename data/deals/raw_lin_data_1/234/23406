mb|p|mb|3C|an|bergan|mb|3D|nt|kingcur: in CR, it was opened 1@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|kingcur: and rebid 4@H after E passed t/o dbl by N. That was doubled by N, but S decided to bid 5@D|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|murat e: 4h makes by luck........|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kingcur: 4@H makes if W drops @HQx, and he will be forced to drop it. So, -500 a winning result for NS, but maybe not that obvious to run North's dbl,|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: kökten want to learn alerts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|murat e: you think tou need little luck when u sort your cards but you really need|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kingcur: West will pass, but very reluctantly|pg||
nt|kingcur: after all, two major suit queens are enough to make 6|pg||
nt|murat e: kökten suspicious now|pg||
nt|adonis18:  tough on N to se save here:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kingcur: he may lead trumps, even when Q8 is not a great holding to do it from...but he has @S in defense that could get ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|murat e: he thinks his diamonds not cashing after souths dbl but it is also clubs not cashing|pg||
nt|psyck: 18 HCP & pd even finds a bid, & N has to keep quiet :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kingcur: and he does|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: could have doubled when he was wondering about the auction|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: i wonder what 3@c was|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kingcur: I'm with Kökten leading trumps here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h6|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|psyck: I would have probably lead @d like a simple soul|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c was shortness I'm told|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: two sp and one d|pg||

nt|mdgraham: strong club auction coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever 2@h was, it wasn't very impressive|pg||
nt|gsper:  *lucky|pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry i was sort of assuming north had opened 3@H :) since that is what we were discussing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems the 2@S bid put them in new territory|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c biraz fazlaydý geçen elde|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Versace will be disappointed|pg||
nt|kemperg: we see here the better players dont get max. points any time:)|pg||
nt|psridhar:  another consideration is Lauria wd not hv bid 4@c if he was not interested in action...|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: a lot can be learned looking at the spots on that hand |pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump at favourable vulnerability only, i think|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6nt -by squeeze here als|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet D-B muhtemelen 5 karo deseydi yapardý|pg||
nt|sybarra: good teaching hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: duboin went quietly with his 7-5 in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: much as bocchi did with his red 7-5 earlier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D probably a single-suited major|pg||
nt|athene: to splinter or not to splinter?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re  Spain and wifi:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: my grandmother would have dbld|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: maybe 7-5 is an Unlucky Shape or something for them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although West will probably get in the act |pg||
nt|tez: 7@h oynarlar|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ns ters girildi boardda|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: zorlu yerinde tokay tokay yerinde zorlu oynuyor masada|pg||
nt|tez: çayýnýzý almaya gidebilirsiniz..uzar biraz konuþma|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama 4 kör barajý karo fitini bulmalarýný engelledi|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Babela: pero si el robot está lento no tiene chance|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should make 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry only 6-5 here of course|pg||
nt|athene: north was stuck; if he ducked at trick 1, hoping for a heart shift, declarer could win the ace immediately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, after a similar start to the auction at the other table South did raise to 3@d :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl=both majors|pg||
nt|athene: this is 800|pg||
nt|athene: despite the 12-card fit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@C=10-13 with 6@C or 5@C+another|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: doðunun elindeki @c9 lu çok yararlý kart (@c10 tekten gelince)|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|gsper:  And 2@S is not Muiderberg or something, but a constructive part of the system|pg||
nt|athene: well 6@C looks best here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c +1  is easy ofcause |pg||
nt|athene: you can even make 7@C i suppose on the layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can S pass?? I doubt that he will|pg||
nt|athene: sure he can|pg||
nt|athene: well, he can if double is penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but vulnarable it is understandable the other one was nV|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110 available both ways -this -100 with best def|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H pass/correct invitational, by the look of it |pg||
nt|danilo1: will end here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East-West will not find the @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: þu anki sýralama http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_round.php?round=4769|pg||
nt|psridhar:  this Bd shd be a flat @s game making|pg||
nt|kingcur: this will end in 4@S, I presume|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: 6@C is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: only @DA as an obvious loser, as you can throw a diamond on the @SK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but if you draw trumps you only have 11 tricks with crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: i think north ought to be raising clubs if her partner can bid them twice|pg||
nt|baardolav: Too conservative not double... I think. you pay 590 one out of 7 times but that is 4 imps only...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: yes, opposite vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt scramble now, perhaps|pg||
nt|gsper:  EW were thoroughly preempted out|pg||
nt|psyck: made it difficult for EW to enter at this vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @D GF?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not a good start for defence|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 450 modest consolation|pg||
nt|sybarra: or check back of some sort?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kingcur: think so|pg||
nt|kemperg: GF chackback I think|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3@S slow arrival now, S having too much for a direct 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: maybe a diamond lead would give problems|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead would certainly cause problems, but the club looks normal to me|pg||
nt|athene: even after a club lead, the defence might have a chance - suppose declarer wins the jack and returns a club; north can win and shift to a diamond now|pg||
nt|ady: even a club lead  may nopt make    diamond switch later may be ok for defence|pg||
nt|danilo1: small @D now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here come the cues |pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: NS play a strong club system, i am guessing over 1@S a bid of 2@C is their only game force|pg||
nt|athene: after a club lead declarer can go for hearts immediately of course, but that looks risky with just a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: well when you only go for 500 with that dummy, i don't think you can be accused of rash bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: but it still costs an imp |pg||
nt|athene: maybe west comes under pressure, having to guard both majors, and you can ruff the @HK or @S10 good|pg||
nt|gsper:  A D by E risked 4 or 5@C from partner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D was obviously something weird - maybe showed just a minimum hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead stops 6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  under 6 @c you can stay with good justment|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cant|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ý have no idea about website|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: if declarer plays hearts early   should make|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if NS's agreement is that 2nt here is lebensohl or a scramble|pg||
nt|sybarra: not 4 @H?   |pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: in italy most doubles suggest a desire to compete further, even after the fit has been found|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt neymiþ ümit?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S the end?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: interesting that north does not unblock - you would think he would, as then either defender can win the third heart if need be|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you play it as scramble you can use it, like this, to show a weak 3@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: (direct 3@H bid is stronger)|pg||
nt|athene: of course if that is what the double meant then it is easy for south to bid on|pg||
nt|kingcur: 3NT could be non-serious: a hand that has no slam interest unless S is big|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 2nt 3 lü h tutusu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 3 cl soruyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 4 d 11 14 d tek |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|athene: one possibility is to run the spades first - that often makes life hard for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has to play on @H I think|pg||
nt|athene: i think versace might get trump squeezed|pg||
nt|danilo1: wd|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: güneydeki oyuncu bu durumda mutlu olmalý sanýrým|pg||
nt|kemperg: and 4@S emphasises that|pg||
nt|kingcur: S would have become more enthusiastic perhaps if N had not shown @D cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: this must be there form of cue bids |pg||
nt|kemperg: for S @SQ instead of @HQ is enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why ace of @H not shown|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe N showed it |pg||
nt|kingcur: so, would we leave it @@4@S with this S hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: would deny @D controle|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 4 @C, last train, cue for hts?|pg||
nt|kingcur: I think I would|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is, it might make things hard for you too - you have to find a couple of discards, and you also lose your dummy entries|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Will be 2 or 3 down now - good defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if this holds the trick, what does declarer do next?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume play @C to the A and @C up.  @D A has to be in front|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is fairly sure now that north has the @HA, which makes it safer to play another heart, as north is probably not going to be the one with long hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no way the defence can set themselves up some long hearts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Pity on the nice defense to miss the second ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now heart best|pg||
nt|nilsland:  up to now ;)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kingcur: if 3NT would show a non-serious hand ánd S has bid a last-train 4@H that got no positive response, then I think 6@S can never be good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the cues seemed to all be "last train" type |pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: north obviously worried about the weak opening|pg||
nt|athene: but as a dummy for clubs it is pretty good really|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|athene: @HJ suit-preference for diamonds over clubs of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not disagree with @S back by Fantoni ... attacking options since declarer still fears @D overruffs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner has five hearts of course from the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elinizde hiç puan yok ve rakip þlem yapar mý die düþünürken 200 alacaksýnýz|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|athene: so he tries to set up his suit|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well, gib says he won't any more, anyway|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It could have been made if spade was ducked|pg||
nt|kemperg: conservative, still they will beat me at the table every time:(|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes:) we are best when kibitzing|pg||
nt|psridhar:  last board Versace Xed 3@s forcing to game, and Lauria with his Ace could hv doubled too -From Versace pt of view Lauria's X of 4@c may hv been KQX in @c... all murky , nothing is clear |pg||
nt|psridhar:  the info Versace had -to act over 4@s - was 1. pd pre-raised 2. voluntarily bid 4@c 3. did not X 4@s|pg||
nt|psridhar:  tough life at times....even for LV :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|h6|nt|runnerup:  nice recovering .south was a wake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent of South to hold the @dk|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|nt|ady: will cash out for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: comes out the same|pg||
pc|h4|nt|danilo1: y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since he had trump coup at the end|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: ask tref Q |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tez: 5 nt ile rua sormak ..7 araþtýrmak mantýklý seçenekti|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: trump back could have beaten it - west can keep declarer off dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays a club you insert the queen|pg||
mc|7|nt|kingcur: not the tetbook play in trumps, but S wants one round of trumps drawn before trying to ditch his @D loser|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kingcur: as usual, thx to specs for all comments and questions...do bare with us that we cannot possibly reply to them all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: another kib suggests: 3@c=5@H+another 4+ cards suit. 3@D = relays no heart raise, 4@C = 6@H+4/5@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kingcur: could well be|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: but the 3@c shortness was from the more reliable source :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|kingcur: the likely @S lead bringing the overtrick here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kingcur: so, likely a push board|pg||

nt|athene: many strong clubbers would open that south hand 2@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south knows singleton @d and Qxx in opening hand -this time only 10 points ,,you cant miss this|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, normal to stiop in 4 here, whatever  the cues meant|pg||
nt|kingcur: 13 imp swing on  7 meanwhile; OR in 4@S+1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looks like NS can make 4@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's a decent suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you are not ashamed of your hand if partner bids 3nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rutin bir 4@s eli|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tekrar hatýrlatalým: A grubundan 8, B grubundan 2 takým finale kalacak|pg||
nt|kemperg: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|psridhar:  slam time for NS 6@C|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg:  UNDO ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@C acceptable for me|pg||
nt|athene: versace seems to be in notrump mode :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: no 2@S from south does seem very cautious|pg||
nt|psridhar:  1s-2d-3c-depends on what N will do -raise to 4c or 3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: S knew pard would bid hts! |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Great result for Zaleski in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: decent EW slam, until you look at the NS cards|pg||
nt|queequeg: @S@S ------ Running Ranking ------ @S@S|pg||
nt|queequeg: Lavazza 98           Sabbatini 71|pg||
nt|queequeg: Vinci 89               Patanè 70|pg||
nt|queequeg: Uggeri 81            Bongiovanni 67|pg||
nt|queequeg: Pacini 74           Tamburi  64|pg||
nt|queequeg: Angelini 74           Zaleski 62 |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or at least my pards always do) |pg||
nt|kingcur: playing the hand exactly like Lauria did, incidentally. And he probably was regretting not being in slam until that 2nd @D was ruffed by N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: s can see no penalty pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: W not doubling opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in the pseudo-slam zone again|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well - if N won't bid his suit....|pg||
nt|athene: many would bid 1nt with south here but of course that should be a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=0-9|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4 @h looks good contract -but @h 4-1 and no chance|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive north will bid 3nt and south 4c|pg||
nt|kemperg: not 3N|pg||
nt|psyck: I wonder if 2@s just shows @s's or @d fit jump as well|pg||
nt|psyck: some play double of 1@h as @s suit with @d tolerance|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 1@S is forcing for one round, usually 15+ points|pg||
nt|kingcur: I think LV play weak2's, so then this should show (partial) fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@c Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2d=6-9|pg||
nt|gsper:  1NT natural GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Without major|pg||
nt|psridhar:  stiff @s + AK in 4th suit + a decent @d suit =all favour 4@c well judged|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4c should make the way more easaly?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a natural 4!NT by west would be nice now|pg||
nt|ady: another chance|pg||
nt|athene: it seems that both NS pairs allowed the double of 1@H to talk them out of spades, to an extent|pg||
nt|ady: North seems to have trapped himself not entering the bidding first round|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks wise to me to bid a modest 2@D as W|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if 1@S was arfiticial (2@S instead with 4 spades) then 4nt is logically natural, no agreed suit|pg||

nt|queequeg: =====================================|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if pd such good cards he will try again|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Aluf is wondering if Pd holds @d ace instead of @h ace -same hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D now for spec, but thats gambling|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S, cue, no @D and @H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: stayed low|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, sorry|pg||
nt|psridhar:  tough for Kokten now-pd can hold AKQXXX,X,X,KJ10XX|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: a push   |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib suggests 2@S preempt after TO x - to risky in my view as West likely to have @S virw x|pg||
nt|athene: duck in dummy best shot to build a heart, playing west for @HQ9xx or @HJ9xx|pg||
nt|gsper:  2@D 13+ hcp|pg||
nt|queequeg: 1nt= 10+, any|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it appears fantoni was tempted but could not find a descriptive bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: altan karo çakasýndan korktuðu için 3nt yi önerdi sanýrým|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gerçekten de batýnýn karosu tek olsaydý doðru karar olabilirdi ama bu elde sorun yok|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: Q@C|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d 13+ & 3N 33(34) 15-17   but my sys notes could be old|pg||
nt|gsper:  No 10+ balanced|pg||
nt|athene: north decided that on the bidding, south can't have more than two hearts, and therefore must have three spades :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s 6+S, denies 3+H|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni does not have that many extras now i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C-then-3@S shows good spades and about 18+ or so|pg||
nt|athene: but it seems he is giving this a bit of thought|pg||
nt|danilo1: 7@H board may even cost Championship|pg||
nt|psridhar:  now the key card resp will take them to slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead @C from Qxx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|kingcur: a lot of @S losers to get rid of here|pg||

nt|kemperg: spec confirms|pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup:  yes 2 @s is a clear bid -4 @s is -i cant say aloud --and 4 @h was overboard all ready|pg||
nt|kingcur: but having escaped a trump lead gives best prospects for S|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to lead trump from qxx |pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, impossible trump lead|pg||
nt|kingcur: I must admit I wouldn't even have considered leading trumps here with that holding...but it would have been the only way to beat this contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither, and also the Italians did not:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does it really beat it? |pg||
nt|kingcur: specs pointing out there is a Bols tip telling me that I should have :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: 3 @S losers|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: if def pkays 2 trumps, dec only has 2@d & 8 @c tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if the double shows 4+ spades, then north might want to raise just because of the big fit, but he doesn't want to suggest he has anything|pg||
nt|sybarra: but WHO honestly can lead a club from Qxx??? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: some play transfer to hearts then bid 3nt shows 5 hearts and 4 spades, not forcing|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3-3 now perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the danger here could be the range of the 1NT rebid - no, 2@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: @h SPLINTER NOW ?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: aggressive from north; if partner has only 3 spades, game will never be there, and even when he has 4, it needs a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: on last board alfonsin bid 3NT over 2@S|pg||

nt|danilo1: 50% (or near to that) slam ... good (lucky) choice by Giorgio to bid only 2@S - since @DK unfriendly placed|pg||

nt|athene: east really bid 2@D? is this a 2-way bid, maybe weak spade raise or some strong options?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yy 5@H does make with @S @S lead kibs:)|pg||
nt|kingcur: any spade lead maybe even...which means this could cost: it's not the most unimaginable lead for E after all|pg||

nt|kingcur: thx Shirley :)|pg||
nt|psyck: thx Shirley|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kemperg: bye Shirley|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: maybe a better plan was to cash the @DA at trick 2, then return the heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice to see that even Fantunes can err occasionally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner started with @DKx he can cash the @DK before giving you the heart ruff, and you can give him a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no need to underlead your @DA trying to pick up @DQxx with declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3nt =dd and down in practive if no helping bids in defence (like here) perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so we see lauria's opinion of the tricky bidding problem for balanced 24 count after 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: might very well get the clubs right - we shall see|pg||
nt|athene: he doubled and basically forced to 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup:  lucky 6 @s for bear card bid and made quite lucky|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nilsland:  25 to 7=32 now we surely will see a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  Facing a passed pd Aluf doesnt fancy 4@s and fancies defending 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence that pass of 1N|pg||
nt|kingcur: this looks like a Fantunes style of 2@H opener|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: West might have passed - six spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might deem it unsuitable for a weak two |pg||
nt|gsper:  E has a lot of cards but does not know where to go|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gsper:  And knows even less now|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would bid 3NT now and go down|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s maybe...|pg||
nt|athene: defence have to be slightly careful here to cash out the diamonds and not for example try to cash two hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr: the systematic 2@D bid did S pass else he could bid and NS in a @H contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: clever action|pg||
nt|psyck: now @d goes away|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead should beat i suppose|pg||
nt|kingcur: @C lead too?|pg||
nt|psyck: well if he ducks & they play @d....|pg||
nt|psyck: else winning & playing @s will make|pg||
nt|kingcur: @CA and a spade probably, but no entry to enjoy the discard I think|pg||
nt|psyck: 4th seat 2 level bids generally show such hands|pg||
nt|psyck: as kibs point, will need to unblock @s Q & fin due to entry probs|pg||
nt|kingcur: that would be some play|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg:  http://77.238.22.164/g2bwrama/ftpout/miniram1.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another failing 7 perhaps|pg||
nt|danilo1: hopefully only 6 this time :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  We dont have any system notes. Has East showed @C+@H?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so but just a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am told, on the NS methods, if south WAS 4333, he would be 18-20, so that was out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i never see in table any one to finess @c -not expected here |pg||
nt|athene: west tries to conceal the position in clubs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2@H was natural or 22-24 bal|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if sittng birds are to be shot.....|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is behind us, so no scores|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and rarely u get to shoot Lauria's contract !|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Opposite an overcall, Hedy?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: 6 either major makes with spades friendly.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence don't realise the urgency to cash out in diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: tough call but he may see there are no other chances|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: very good slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clever it may hv been but NS can make 2@s and the upshot could well be -2 imps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: kickard, love it|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 6@H is a bit better than 6@S because you might make it even with a bad spade break, but it's hard to get out of a 4-4 fit once you lock into it|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play 9@H now only down chance |pg||
nt|psyck: wd|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sry 24+ bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@C looks like nat (@C support) and slam interest|pg||

nt|danilo1: and 4NT is probably @D cue ...so Sementa asks for third round control in @H now I thk|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way looks a shakey auction|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... but he may get third round @S control :)|pg||

nt|athene: i think east should have taken control with blackwood over 4@D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c - so old hat these days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that could be a very expensive @d7 discard|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: west can never know if 7 is good because he does not know his partner has six solid hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @S2 to K and club finesse?|pg||

pc|sT|nt|gsper:  3@H is not good, but what else is?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: some specs are suggesting that if west wants to give the impression he has no club honour in hand, the jack was a better card to play|pg||

mb|3H|nt|athene: if they wake up and bid a cold 4@S you just hope that your teammate are in it anyway|pg||

nt|mdgraham: cc says 2@s=realy, but maybe that doesn't apply by a passed hand  |pg||
nt|athene: if partner asks you for non-spade suits and you have seven in one of them, you might want to bid |pg||

nt|runnerup:  this is not gonna make :) .heh heh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think W playing 3@d on a 3-2 fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bright kib said better W bidding 2@H and then 3@H (for the ones who see 3@H as 5/5m)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know what 3@C means but i have no doubt they will bid 6@H|pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: double 3@C looks normal with west but this will work out fine anyway|pg||

nt|athene: might be a problem now if north passes after a looong think, and south finds 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|gsper:  But even then 3@D is not obvious|pg||
nt|psyck: if so 3@d @c single (with 3@h @d single & 3@s @s single)?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Quite possibly|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead you might well need five diamond tricks so small to the queen is right, isn't it? gains against @DKx onside or @Dxx as here|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx or @DKxx|pg||
nt|ritong: down two, seems|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: even if North is known to have slow-passed, 5@d isn't unreasonable with 7411 shape|pg||

nt|bobholl: what he shows now with 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, so now you lay down the @DA|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|athene: west might duck a heart lead|pg||
nt|gsper:  We don't know how srong 2NT could have been|pg||

nt|kingcur: small @S might work too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: yes, but if close to limit raise values, E can envisage a slam with right cards|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi might be contemplating 4nt here? heart lead, seven (!) diamonds, and lead a spade up for the tenth, just hoping the defence can't cash too many clubs|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|athene: but he doesn't know that his singleton club is so suitable, facing such a weak suit|pg||

nt|jaapfr: an Italian from Argentine or vv?|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, we saw previously that they overcall on air easily|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: that applies to the defense also, 6@D was going down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: lets say could go down|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though the defence should have one trick in each suit here with no problems, but north is in danger of getting endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: so the spade shift was actually necessary|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  angel=Angelini -west playing morsy perhaps |pg||
