nt|algraves:  so just to follow up on the 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ady: how did that make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from NS SSF   "Mid-hand honor leads: shift to 10 generally shows interior sequence (HJT or HT9), typically lead rusinow through declarer (except as above)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swing action for Rodwell would be PASS :)   looks like auto opener for him|pg||
nt|athene: this could get very competitive if NS find their diamond fit|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s may compete to 5@D|pg||
nt|leroumain: doctorul ar fi meritat un pas la 1@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves:  if it is invitational then when the opps blast to 4@H then partner can make a reasonable decisoin|pg||
nt|bebechira: pai nu e forcing?|pg||
nt|bebechira: poate sa aiba 20hcp....|pg||
nt|leroumain: de ce sa fie forcing?|pg||
nt|gheo1954: un tur e forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: nu cred ca 1 puca se poate pasa|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves:  if you bid just 1@S then it is a tough choice all aroudn|pg||
nt|3for3: normal 4@H game, Spector stole a trick in the OR|pg||
nt|bebechira: pica lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  and 2@S weak is just not that effective anymore |pg||
nt|algraves:  2@S invitainol has much more reward |pg||
nt|barnets: slam bid in open room |pg||
nt|leroumain: ahbonsipartenerul cu 5 punte si 3@s ce zice?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: we knew somebody sitting EW would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: strong result for nickell in the OR|pg||
nt|dburn: he'll need to steal more of those than there are boards if he's to win this one - still, one big swing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: was jsut what south wanted to hear    but a normal opening |pg||
nt|ady: both major games should go down e/w    both 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|bigtrain: deoesn't seem likely it will be bid here|pg||
nt|barnets: north drove to slam after souths 4 @H raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: a club splinter will do the job here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: everyone at this world class elvel usually falsecards with @SQ or @S7 if worried about a ruff, so by playing the natural card of @S , Hurd was trying to make Zia think that East's ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( was not a doubleton. Very delicate. Only an expert would fall for the true card being "tricky"|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 51|pg||
nt|algraves:  good point|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2cupe daca are 2 cupe sau 1nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: daca are 5 cupe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: if they get to slam after this start...  )|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: on my good days i hold 5 trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: in  6@H dec was assisted with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he ruffed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bobh1: Zia's pushy 4@S call might backfire as if they struggle into 4@S NS might not save and 4@S might make|pg||
nt|petergill: East's @S9 i mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: There are some seeding points in play for 2013 trials, but only for intact teams and only to get bye to R16|pg||
nt|barnets: drew trumps and conceded a diamond|pg||
nt|bebechira: in dona 9 se joaca 3 cupe contrate in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: probably going down|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make a could of @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: in fact the hand belongs ot n./s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should call those "placement points"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: potential committee  for 11 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice or lucky stop?|pg||
nt|barnets: undo|pg||
nt|barnets: please|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, if you don t you will have trouble playing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on the previous board, they tell me cohler is in 4@S on a @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks walter|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if 2Nt is intended as showing a good raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry..lost connection|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: 5@S would be down 1 on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: so par for n/s is 500 +|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: a sort of good-bad 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: which forced 3@C perhaps. |pg||
nt|algraves:  well we dont know in these cases|pg||
nt|petergill: South's hesitation over 3@D makes it look like S thinks N has more than N has|pg||
nt|algraves:  but we can assume that they do|pg||
nt|algraves:  Cheek and Grue continue there sure footed play by bidding 6NT where Hamman Zia missed the slam|pg||
nt|algraves:  that has 12 tricks on any distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Wooldridge has a lot of points, but many of them are locked up in the KQ doubleton in clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w i mean|pg||
nt|bigtrain: like i said...  strong result in the OR :)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes well done by ralph katz in north|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: 3s was q|pg||
nt|mildredb: nickell made the 4@H call|pg||
nt|barnets: and nickel too who evaluated more than here|pg||
nt|mildredb: I can't imagine not bidding slam if pard bids 4@H/2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: destined to go down|pg||
nt|algraves:  he would have had to play 3 rounds of clubs pitching both hearts, |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: kibs suggesting 5 clubs or 5 diamonds make    but 11th trick not really there   |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C makes but after the @H tap you can only make 10 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe a @D lead beats 5@C also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge bid 3@S over 3@D  auction isn't over yet|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  @D lead beats 5@C since you need a @H ruff for the 11th trick|pg||
nt|ady: heart tap in diamonds will stop any chance of ruffing a spade in north hand   and in 5 clubs a diamond lead  would  force trumps to be drawn to stop a heart ruff in south hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now it is   other room 3@S East|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bobh1: a toy to show majors|pg||

pc|h6|nt|ady: did 4 spades really make?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia sits north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he overcalled 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL asks for 5+ tricks on defense|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: get comfortable|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ritong: if you have to bid 2@h with this rockcrusher as well as with 12 5422, troubles are not unexpected|pg||

nt|petergill: Looks like 110 to me|pg||
nt|algraves:  we do know that the final auction is 2@S by Wests|pg||
nt|barnets: south is on lead so a spade lead just beats it 3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: not sure what the double of 2@H meant but north is surely min for his double so jumping to 3nt looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  70   Nickell played 1N in both rooms   it was only right in one of them  +90  -100 for no swing|pg||

pc|c7|nt|algraves:  good point, we are not sure how the play went. There was a legititmate line so perhaps that occurred.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: what % of unmakeable contracts come in because a defensive ace is taken prematurely?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Jan Martel   Zia actually usually sits S, but N is facing the window and Hamman didn't like the light in his eyes, so they changed - Zia said he hadn't sat N in years,|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  well 1@H is lower|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if swap vulnerability  if Meckstroth opens 2@C|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs - is that really a double facing a passed hand? I mean, equal-level conversion notwithstanding...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|algraves:  south has normal opener for their limited precision 1D style|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H has lower risk than 2@H (no -800) and does not tell the opponents that you are weak |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   might make 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  they would bid zero hearts for the lead if they could but you have to bid at least 1 I understand|pg||
nt|athene: xx = psyche?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue finally gets a chance to operate|pg||
nt|athene: east definitely very close to 2@C opener|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems normal to me...  but i play with meck alot :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h presumably a sound spade raise|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the other room too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgehands.com/E/Equal_Level_Conversion_Doubles.htm|pg||

mb|2S|nt|bobh1: i imagine their range is 14-16|pg||
nt|petergill: Joel Wooldridge prefers Dbl of 1@H to 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did overcall 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for both pairs  2@C opener = 10-15, 6+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: and north only bid  3@S and they missed a decent game|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@d - if it shows shortness, South could just bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Kuzey ile Doðu güney ile de batý ayný perdede|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: had north tried with  3@H south may have bid game|pg||

nt|ady: yesz  should lose 3 diamonds and 2 aces|pg||

nt|barnets: and led a " normal " @DK|pg||
nt|1mavzer: yarý yarýya :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|algraves:  of course you need to be playing a strong club to give you cover on hans like this , so that the non one club openers are limited to 15|pg||
nt|gheo1954: offf|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts hopeless|pg||
nt|ady: is this lead true?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so one can argue wether West should have bid , the point was that NS just doing there normal bidding made it difficult to sort everything out.|pg||
nt|algraves:  They play Rusinow in bid suits|pg||
nt|petergill: or he might play "safe" (unsafe if clubs 4-1) for 110 by not trying the @D hook|pg||
pc|hK|nt|algraves:  and why not lead a @S?|pg||
nt|algraves:  got to lead something|pg||
nt|dburn: and unless Hurd makes a somewhat unlikely seven overtricks here, plus 300 North-South will score pretty well|pg||
nt|3for3: the cards lay very well for north south|pg||
pc|h5|nt|leroumain: negativ:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Al, can you see why @SQ is a good play here?|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot, but if Zia is doing it, there must be a reason|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am sure why West raised it, and why North-South withdrew from the auction - they could not know how good a fit they had|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|algraves:  remember the @D bid just said no 5 card major not 14-16 balanced not 6 clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge in 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S automatic|pg||
nt|bigtrain: totally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S needs suit quality|pg||
nt|gheo1954: lacomia|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: seems a diamond lead more normal than underleading 5 card suit with the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: grue penalized for super light opening.|pg||
nt|3for3: Of couse, a spectator notes that if he had rebid 2@C....|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that would have been Gazzilli, or some such - no one has voluntarily bid clubs to show clubs since about 1983|pg||
nt|3for3: I suspect he didnt relish the though of a preference to his 98653 of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: not gazilli|pg||
nt|3for3: they do the big club thing|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: if it was 15-17, S would invite|pg||
nt|algraves:  well, Grue judged to lead the suit the partnership was known to have, and put declarer to potential guess at trick one.|pg||
nt|ady: whatever led    no chance to make|pg||
nt|algraves:  if King in dummy declarer may well get it wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl makes @DK likely to be offside, so there was a real danger of a @D ruff if @D was played at Trick 2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|athene: @CA was a falsecard i guess|pg||
nt|athene: trying to make declarer put east with another high card somewhere else|pg||
nt|athene: for example the @SK :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   i think @CA to help clarify 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he played the @CK at trick 1 and then turned up with the @HQ as a passed hand, it would not be too hard to drop the @SK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|algraves:  personally I like the dash of that lead even though it cost a trick|pg||
nt|algraves:  even though it did not gain a trick|pg||

nt|petergill: Even with @DK onside, a @D ruff was posible if the @D hook was taken|pg||

nt|bobh1: this one doesn't look promotable|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he knew Cheek was ruffing -- so takes opportunity to help Rodwell|pg||
nt|athene: well declarer is just short of tricks now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: even if he gets the spades right|pg||
nt|athene: he had to lead a diamond towards the queen i suppose|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: There might be an "intra-finesse" here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that line was a result of Larry Cohen's book on Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i used bad instead of new math    Diamond +78|pg||
nt|barnets: against hearts|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Oktayýn DBL iyi deðil, 3@h-4@h gibi birþey demeli|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: Joel might have sniffed at slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S by Cheek  stopper showing   and implies concern about @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told   Edgar Kaplan wrote "All 4H bids are transfers to 4S"" 30 years before Larry Cohen wrote about the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
nt|leroumain: lucky 3nt in loc de 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: how about a spade lead v 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS had too much information to play the mundane [and makeable] 3N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves:  gadzooks an intra finesse in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  we bring you all the exciting news|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, lead low to 7 or 9, then run queen for one loser. The term intra-finesse was invented by Gabriel Chagas of Brazil in (I think) a Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lie of the EW cards seems to doom everything now|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bu elle bu kadar pasif kalýnmaz|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: maybe South could double (which shows spades and tolerance for diamonds) and then bid diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: ortaða güveniyorsan 4@h iyi|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|algraves:  on a good day this makes.|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: kendine güveniyorsan 3@h :(|pg||
pc|hA|nt|algraves:  but this is not a good day|pg||
pc|h2|nt|algraves:  at least this little part of the day|pg||
nt|barnets: now down 1|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would like to eliminate the diamonds before playing trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule showing local timezone of VIEWER  via  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more 15-board sets remain to determine Semi-Finalists|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nice result in open room|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: then after east got his ruff he would be endplayed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|algraves:  What do EW make in @D ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 split  makes life a bit more difficult   but 11 tricks looks ok|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes one way or another|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: but sadly dummy does not have an entry for the second diamond ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: final board for this fast table|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: K@H lead might make 5@D difficult|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue, who stuck his neck a long way out with 2@s and was lucky not to be handed his head, did remarkably well to go down only one|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|dburn: still, no great harm done - no one could take a swing at four diamonds, so Spector will win an IMP or two|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|3for3: not a friendly lie, this will fail, pushing the nickell lead to the 20s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfk: it won;t matter if this score stands|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
mc|9|nt|1mavzer: 12.15 de görüþmek üzere|pg||
