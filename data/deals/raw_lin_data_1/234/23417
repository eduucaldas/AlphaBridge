mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|rnmalik: NT= 10 to 12 and 2@C for majors and likely 2@H by W.|pg||
nt|udo: 3 @H was aggressive with 2 bidding opps,,,and maybe 1 to high|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: friendly placement of cards and the lead helps, how the trumps are tackled would decide the fate of the contract.|pg||

nt|lokaty: yes, he has a great suit, but still in this vulnerability it is an action|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: @d honours are both on side, @s honours both off, so 4@h should be ok for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|andersk: 3@S splinter, maybe|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: Pass or 2@H now?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|udo: and maybe no @S lead now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lokaty: lucky @D and @H distribution gives them 10 tricks I think|pg||
nt|andersk: I guess 1 @D is limited to 15, so South should probably bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like xfer back to @Hs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzdd: 2@D = weak 6+ @H or some stronger hand with 5+@H|pg||

nt|viren169: 4 trump losers and a club|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: then she would have bid @c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: obviously a bidding misunderstanding|pg||
