nt|mdgraham: here it is obviously natural|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@c = balanced 11-13 or many other hands|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: Ghesten is a preferable method, where 2@c would be nat|pg||

nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or im American terms, 2@c natural and 2@d Michaels|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Presumably x is takeout.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  after east opening bid 3nt looks nice -but @s finess off and this 22 points 3nt would fail -of course in is not biddable and west in with 2 @s now so other story|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||
nt|santyclz: And don't forget that pd opened in 3rd seat so may have a sub-minimal hand with short @ss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Oh my.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with the potential ruffs by W |pg||

pc|d3|nt|sybarra: @D suit hidden, and I wonder what 3 or 4 @D would have been by N |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is similar to the last board where with primary support n x'd an overcall instead of showing support.  A very difficult way to play.|pg||

nt|kemperg: not the best defense:(|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andreasw:  William tell them to slow down a bid! they are all playing insanely fast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but the spade play is tempting|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he has a problem with 5-3 on that line|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H that is|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Brogeland got on the board when EMA x'd 5@s at the other table.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|d|nt|sybarra: any shapey 10 count |pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@S was a bit wild|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: unilateral 4@S for sure|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andreasw:  After partners pass i like 1@s more.. here it worked good though.. 2@s should be -1 with right defence while with the lead 1!N is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: N has shown 14-16 6c@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: If s has the j (as happened), ruffing with the 8 gains a trick.  If n has the j it doesn't matter with which you ruff,  the j is going to score.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ady: interesting   on a trump lead  if a club is ducked the defence may need to force dummy with spades   may still go down|pg||
