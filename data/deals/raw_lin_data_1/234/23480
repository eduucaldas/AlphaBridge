mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||

nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||

mb|3D!|an|GF|mb|p|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||

nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: possible pickup here, 3NT makes N/S?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|panosk: on a non @C |pg||
nt|andersk: I didnt consider other leads than @C or @D :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: contremplating something else as 3nt ?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: sorry no, not making|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|murat e: if south makes a lightner double west can revert to diamonds....|pg||
nt|panosk: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe NS should have a deefence to show MM here|pg||
nt|ady: could make on a heart lead if played by north|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|murat e: sry not meant this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  North's silence over both 2@c and 3@d seems somewhet less than optimal|pg||
nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||
nt|andersk: instead they win 13|pg||
nt|henryb:  10, I think for non-vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Trust me, Christer pass was not hopeing EW had major fit, too much unlikely|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: any lead but @c played from North|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely fir north to bid no-trumps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|andersk: yes 10  sorry|pg||

nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||
nt|murat e: with helgemo playing|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
nt|panosk: 3 imps it is |pg||
nt|ady: best lead    but looks a push with 9 easy tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panosk: thx all for watching|pg||
