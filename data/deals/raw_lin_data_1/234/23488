pc|hA|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
pc|h9|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||

nt|panosk: 9@H shud be in dummy :) |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ybob: now @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|panosk: maybe double dummy can make, 2 rounds of trumps, pull 3@H to throw loser in @C and thrn A@D and @D to 10|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|mamos:  and as the cards lie @cQ would have beaten 4@s|pg||

mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
pc|d6|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|ady: north has taken the push     hard to judge    should be down 1|pg||
nt|ady: especially on diamond lead|pg||
nt|panosk: with spades behaving this will make|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|c3|nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||

nt|andersk: 4 @C was alerted as short, but I beleve it was asking partner to transfeer to he's major|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@c for E?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if he intend to open in first hand that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andersk: Probably down on @D switch|pg||
mc|12|nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: n/s save in 4@S  down 4 on best defence|pg||
nt|ady: a good swing here for North if resisting any save|pg||

nt|panosk: players are also humans so they make a wrong decision from time to, its the duration that counts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: leades gained 10 on hand 19 where club end play was found   though defence made it a little easier by cashing ace of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4 hearts should play for 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: dia finesse not working so both 3 nt and 5 dia are destined to fail|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bobholl: yes guess it was check back passed :)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||

nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|andersk: 1 NT bad, when partner dont have majors (which he often does not have when you self have 4-3 in MM)|pg||

pc|d7|nt|murat e: otherwise declarer woujd go between one of the black suit finesses|pg||
nt|panosk: compared to last 1 this 3nt will look a walk in the park for Helgemo|pg||

nt|ady: club lead may hold to 10 as Jack will be played|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|djneill:  will be a little worrisome, South the danger hand, hard to avoid South for sure - danger hand being the one you do not want on lead|pg||

nt|andersk: Actually EW deserve to loose IMPs for not bidding this great slam|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc they use suction(yes lek in Norwegian) vs strong 1@c and 2@c, maybe Christer was hoping for some Major fit E/W|pg||

pc|sK|nt|panosk: 15.45 according to schedule, 18.15 is last broadcast of today|pg||
nt|djneill:  should East go on?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Took the save before e-w could find their potential. Might reach 6 h here|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4@s looks ok|pg||
nt|ady: need to bid the slam for a plus on this hand for Drammen|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andersk: thats 50 minutes from now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: making there as well, @h lead from south|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|panosk: so plenty more action to come|pg||
nt|bobholl: will become a push unless @H guess goes wrong|pg||
nt|mamos:  one that got away  both ways|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|murat e: spade lead was better here|pg||
nt|ady: only a spade lead and miss guess can beat 6@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  Looks like Helgemo will gain 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andersk: @H A now and Helgemo will gain 3 IMP|pg||
nt|panosk: true but i think will be ducked|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 more from earlier efforts|pg||
nt|andersk: thx to co-commentators NBF and Namsos BK, see you all in about 45 minutes :)|pg||
nt|murat e: if declarer makes the mistake of ducking twice east shifts to a club and if this one also ducked another club cuts declarer off to his hand of course these scenarios not correct ...|pg||
nt|murat e: with helgemo playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: thx vm Kristoffer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|djneill:  looks like it plays like a double-squeeze even if plays 3 hearts, unless they force out the @d entry early|pg||
nt|ady: once the spade loser is thrown on K@C   east will draw 2 trumps   and play diamonds ruffing the 4th diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|murat e: after the ace of spades cashed the 9 spot did not appear so he should have worked out the possible layouts in the trump suit|pg||
nt|panosk: 3 imps it is |pg||
nt|ady: best lead    but looks a push with 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think so too|pg||
nt|sverjohn: can not go wrong now|pg||
