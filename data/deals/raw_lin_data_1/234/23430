nt|vugraphzft: hi all and welcome to this pre-chamions league final entertainment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: We start the match with a change of players|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Scania thought they could meet the same players in both halfs since they play a complicated system, but it seems it wasn't complicated enough to make the cut|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: because it looks like the last board from the last set|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hi all and welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is the fifth match of the 2012 championships where we'll see Kamras, last year's runner-up, against the experienced Team Zang|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mamos:  loks like puppet|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: shd be puppet|pg||

nt|kemperg: not easy , good lead|pg||

nt|mamos:  so N shows a  4 card major and South shows Spades  (by bifdding Hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/Yoda.pdf for their convention card (in Swedish)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is because last year North here played in team Kamras|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East has shown his five spades and four clubs in the bidding, and West then gets to decide the final contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos:  and strong hand is declarer :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzft: looks like he will lose 1@D and 1@H thanks to the lucky lie in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: an intra finesse in trumps does the work if declarer can handle the rest|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS plays strong club with 5c M-openings|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@c being a GF relay in this sequence|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: It would have taken a misguess in spades as well as one in clubs for declarer to go down|pg||
nt|oliverc: definitely|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  An old-fashioned 2@s bid here.|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @c finesse works here, but it is not enough for a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: declarer went for the percentage play in trumps (if South had Kxx, low to the nine would have cost the contract) and went down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Welcome back to Örebro where we're playing the third day out of four in the Swedish Teams Championships|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Hans-Ove is in fact in the lead with 0.5 VP|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: hi Friede|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW doesn't rate to make much here, NS should manage about 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: You have to stay out of 5 of either minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7 or 17+, hence the rest of their openings are placed somewhere in between|pg||
nt|bt: brb|pg||
nt|oliverc: How does that come to be in their CC?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 5@h is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract won't be pretty if Wrang finds a pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it looks like they can take 6 red suit tricks, the ace of clubs and three trumps|pg||

nt|runnerup:  5-2-2-4 normally is 1 @s but Wrang thougth otherwise|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: So we will now follow "The Fight of the Forcing Pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS have the values for game, and enough tricks as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|muppe: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Playing a 5-2 in a major seemed successful on the last board, so why not now?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos:  no reson not  to pas  1NT IMHO|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Hello Vesa |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As someone mentions, 6@d was a lucky make on the last board which one of the top teams had to experience|pg||
pc|hA|nt|georgi:  ranking updated + teams roster|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS  abit unlucky here in that South's values are mostly no help|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C was Stayman, but didn't promise a major|pg||
nt|baldfriede: so a kind of garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|mamos:  garbage is the word|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think 1NT shows @C and 2@S is natural with the strong hand|pg||
nt|po-s: clearly not 0-7...|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops, that run didn't do EW any good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|georgi:  http://bridge.bg/ranking1054.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT was 1 down, this has a chance|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Smörgasbröd comess with everything in Sweden :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@C has put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky for south diamonds will be overruffed in dummy and hearts in hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ... and NS had no problem getting to the right spot|pg||
nt|oliverc: They play the Smörgasbörd 2@D?|pg||
nt|mamos:  not an easy lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a 3-3 @S fit = garbage i suppose :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Other than @ss, of course.)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and NT is totally impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@c is a bit tricky with a spade lead too though|pg||
pc|h9|nt|runnerup:  3nt is coffee board I am not criticising just telling what i saw|pg||
nt|bt: see if ns can sort this out, though i think east ran premature there|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petka:  the tempo in this bidding worked well for NS. The only one who might feel a bid "underbid" is south, with some extras in her hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that blew a trick (not that it was by any means strange)|pg||
nt|bt: and only one diamond cashes|pg||
nt|bt: 2@C was difficult to double |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, that might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but I guess South would have tried 2NT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|po-s: slam is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps, but it's not one you would like to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He will at least get 5 tricks now so it won't be extremely expensive|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos:  how would he proceed after 2@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you chose your third suit as trump that is|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: 4@C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow, some partscore overbidding here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sundell knows that his p is short in @H... still a brave 3@C with his 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant say anything nice about that 3@C bid except it did its job|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|po-s: before or after?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  I think that Sout would have dobled 2@C.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, we'll never know now :)|pg||
nt|bt: a slow double of 2@C looks perfect|pg||
nt|bt: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A trump shift might induce North to take the finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I wonder too. garbage stayman works best with longer @d instead with lonfer @c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2:  Now 5 down if they take all their tricks|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|kemperg: 4@S down by @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Well, 3@H is also some bid on a flat hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: with a pre-passed partner|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and a bare 11|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: After a quiet start this can be more interesting :)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6n by north is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1NT showed a maximum (11+) and 3@C was natural, might have been canapé|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if you're still interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here comes a board with really bad breaks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we have Hans- Ove's son Alexander watching his dad in action here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so every VP crucial|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6@h is down on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: (due to an upper cut)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But 6NT is always making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Fredin was not happy with his partner|pg||
nt|bt: so the double of 1nt asked for a @S lead, know north will ask why he didnt lead it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 10-13 hcp, normally a 6-c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  Forsberg-GrÃ¶nkvist leading in the current running scores, but very small differences|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@d = 8-11, bal/4M5+m/5-5m|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in the end situation |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mikael and Jim|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a quiet 2@S here|pg||

mb|1N|nt|vugraphzft: Director has been called|pg||

nt|runnerup:  south is shut out of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Ida will bid 2@D now|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and that will end the auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: seems wrong explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to EW it's the double that's incorrect, not the explanation|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: According to CC a normal weak 2:  http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/pekksalo1.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this will lead to a 4-2 fit instead of a 4-4 one|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Kamras has had a nice start here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: one down in a vulnerable game that could make and then +800|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: let's see if Scania can turn this around|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: On a lucky day this would be a slam. And this is a lucky day because it is right-sided.|pg||
nt|mamos:  can they bid a slam from North|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d by n also available now|pg||
nt|mamos:  indeed mayne now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North has a very good hand for seing partner open 2@C gameforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang with a successful decision here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might push NS into 5@H down (it could also make)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|runnerup:  4 @h needs careful play |pg||
nt|po-s: "making 12" gör jag som spelförare|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yet another 1NT-3NT with a 4c major. We've seen several of these auctions this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  East will have no problem making this|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps they play something artificial after a 1N intervention? so that her choice was pass or 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they don't|pg||
nt|mamos:  4-4 major fits are so important|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS doesn't make game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = @H + @C, minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 2@S = good-looking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  40 and diamonds like that, hmm|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT was good, a pen.dbl too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  also 3nt sits|pg||
nt|baldfriede: ah, finally a CC which is in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... and this is two down misguessing spades, otherwise only one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: In the other room East opened the bidding on his five-count(in the 6@d-board)|pg||
nt|muppe: this seems makeable, EW had a save available in 5@c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  Some players use 2@C as artifical but 2@D is normally nat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 2@D wasn't making|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2 @D, 3 @S and 1 @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so only a minor swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Funny thing you mention that. Been a lot of discussion in the swedish forums about how rude it is to make your cc's in english rather than swedish|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would guess he will finesse spades since it's an odds-on play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos:  south has overbid  in myopinion|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: w/o @H lead it can make i thk|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H showed a bad raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Showing 6-16. They ended up in 3NT nevertheless|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzft: yes, that's true. Diamonds are 3-3 so it might be possible to make now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Win with the king, cash the ace of spades and play four rounds of diamonds pitching two hearts?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 4@h appears to be asking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@H= rkc ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It's of course normal when 3433 |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Communications are rather terrible on this board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzft: For specs on bbo however, english is obviously prefered|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT is the contract i would like to be in with the EW cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|runnerup:  east migth run to 2 @s but it makes 3nt a good contract -finess =|pg||
nt|mamos:  if North cues Clubs they surely will|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: no, it's just a cuebid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: apparently, and S showed 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They've just have a standard cuebidding auction where North will correct 6@D to 6NT because of his lack of trump support|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, ok, a cuebid then. but that should help @s|pg||
nt|po-s: North and South live so far apart that they wouldn´t understand eah other´s dialects|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, for me it is certainly easier to have it in English|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here they have wrongsided the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @c has some extra chances -6 nt you have to finess in rigth red suit |pg||
nt|bt: arvidsson read a lot into the 1nt rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: win in hand and low diamon?|pg||
nt|bt: this is a make now, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *diamond|pg||
nt|bt: fredin should have just continued diamonds|pg||
nt|bt: clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|runnerup:  8 in nt -no hope higher and doubled perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think West had bid out his shape and that there was little point in removing 3NT|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess @C doubleton happens very rarely when u open 1@C|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but with an Ace i wd respond too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i don't really know their style but I think this is the only distribution when it's only two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: some pairs (including myself) open all balanced hands w/o a 5c M 1@C, then it's much more frequent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that may be and only occurs 3% of time, but that is not the reason pass is wrong|pg||
nt|muppe: @h lead cost a trick here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this lead helps a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: need a crossruff, but has to make a @D trick first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do they know i keycard is missing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: maybe not now though|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cruff, 3 rounds of @Ds to pitch a @H and then enter in @SA to ruff 4th @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: According to Peder Linder, North has shown a good slam try with 6+ @C and singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: playing with diamonds as trump would probably have made you happier|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: will be an easy road to 11 tricks for declarer now|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good choice by north, protecting his club holding|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: cuebids are fine but i thk S shd take control with rkc at some point|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5NT was RKC|pg||

nt|runnerup:  south|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Which is strengthed by North's explanations|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oliverc: fast claim here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i mean N can have a similar hand with the @Ca instead of the kj.. then 7 is cold|pg||

nt|bt: i wonder how nilsson can be blamed for this ... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, a nice start for Engström-Arvidsson|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he wasn't, Fredin apologized as soon as he claimed|pg||
nt|bt: good choice |pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: 10 more imps for Sivve since NS in the other room reasonably ducked game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Another good breaking board|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the worst slam /east but 3nt +3 normal result|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wygbe1: with that, n might have bid 6c over 5nt|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kemperg: interesting opening|pg||
nt|mamos:  loks like a partscore board |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the opening lead was a more successful diamond that removed West's entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 10-13 opening once more|pg||
nt|bt: in a strong club framework many would open the west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: EW play Pass as 0-7/ 17+, the rest being artificial as well|pg||
nt|bt: lets see what mr bergdahl decides here, he is creative :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS only have one loser but do not make slam with the bad brakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: true, but that wasn't the case :)|pg||
nt|muppe: Lucky slam here for EW, but after N overcall it could even be bid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, +400 EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: N to take the safe?|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT for EW?|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like a fairly straightforward 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as I said, 5NT was RKC and 6@D showed 0/3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 3@D by NS is likey down too. let us see|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Bennet and Bergdahl here are two of the more creative players in the tournament|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kemperg: means @H Jxxx and @C Jxxxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: If -1 3NT can be problematic NS. If NS have a safe 3NT they often make 500|pg||
nt|baldfriede: oh, Stayman instead of transfer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think these guys play the NT-system made by former pair Upmark/Cullin|pg||
nt|bt: ns are lucky to find their fit at all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if west playes for @d to be nicely he has 4 such -by ducking but still only 8 if defenders see the situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: missed spade-fit here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@d = 8-11 4M4+m/bal/55+ ms|pg||
nt|bt:  unusual, think this is close to a minimum, even in a very positive mindset|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so they knew what they were doing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that is what happened, West (who is a she in the open room btw) ducked but the defence didn't give her a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we can hope for some fireworks, if not on this board but maybe later :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So South determines the hand is worth one bid and elects to make it a @H raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@D = relay, 2@H = any M|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  here is one reason for transfer responses. Playing transfers east could show 44 majors non-forcing with 1C-1D-1H-1S|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If NS atack @H in time they will beat this|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Unless declarer finds to endplay N|pg||
nt|kemperg: thks kib, 4@H , 5)minor, 3010 pts|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3-10|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dangerous opening bid -of course difficult for opponent also ,but even here when south has so good hand 3 @h maybe too high|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Solves the "jobs problem" and convention-card misunderstanding in 1 fell swoop.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Having no eight card fit, they decide to settle in 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos:  2@S will have attracted the best lead but I dont like bidding there on that|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: all about picking up clubs, which he will do|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that brave 2@D bid has pushed E/W overboard here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@s being invitational with 5 spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is a figth .migth end on losing level|pg||
nt|bt: arent they already?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards don't sit nicely so 3nt migth fail -@d lead coming -perhaps helps but not enougth --but on 1- level no problems |pg||
nt|jcwla:  This time catches partner with six. A surprising sellout by EW and not a victory for artificiality.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: 3nt is a weird bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: it shows @H and a maximum, not that strange right?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos:  wow North has faith in his partner's NV overcall|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes but you have to make rigth thing to beat 5 @s|pg||
nt|bt: i think ns did very well to find their fit here, lets see what he does. playing on diamonds after being shortened in dummy doesnt look likely|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nilsland:  So best in to play @H before taking the clubs - difficult thou|pg||
nt|mamos:  nope its pushed  NS overboard as well|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think North bid great, I wouldn't have overcalled 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://tinyurl.com/7qkzz3q  7:2 for running scores|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos:  NS did need to get into the action somehow |pg||
nt|mamos:  but needed to know when to stop pushing|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a balanced hand with 10 hcp is not a two level overcall, non-vul or not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice low @S by Sundell|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Catastrophy stroke on board 2 for Adde when his partner had to play 3@S and went 4 down vulnerable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so this shd go down now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This gave Hans-Ove 10 imps|pg||
nt|bt: well i assumed 2@S was an ask as opposed to natural :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzft: there is no alert ;)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: persson is going for the throw in, his best chance|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bt: true, how could a bid be conventional then|pg||
pc|s7|nt|baldfriede: unfortunate lay-out here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bt: east gives count in hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  Or S can keep the @HA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes. nice play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|baldfriede: very well done.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: as so often is the case, the five-level belonged to the opponents|pg||
nt|runnerup:  very rigth|pg||
nt|bt: the 9th spade was missing unfortunately|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kemperg: anybodys lead, small from QJxxx?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2 down non-vulnerable and undoubled is a very reasonable score here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: anyway, 3@D is also down|pg||
nt|po-s: an unblock would have been better|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So making 3 - next|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzft: this will go one down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt:  now maybe south shouldnt invite knowing they have a 8card fit and maximum 23 hcp?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: nice def|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East doesn't look very happy right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: don't know if it's cause partner's thinking or because he thinks he made an error himself|pg||

nt|baldfriede: played !N for @h and thus lost the overtrick|pg||

nt|mamos:  hands fit very well for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: East apologized for not doubling|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i think that's why he was upset|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Our operator is the one and only Ida GrÃ¼nzwiebel from Mozambique|pg||
nt|jcwla:  No real point to guessing the @DJ there as will not provide two pitches for @S, only goal was to try to sneak a trick through.|pg||
nt|bt: unlucky but normal|pg||
nt|bt: nice slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: yes, no reason to expect anything but a push or 3 imps to San Sac|pg||
nt|runnerup:  was it really nessessary to finess when north had bid ,but it is only 1 imp |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3VP is the difference between 1st and 4th at the moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzeg: has given me many spadeleads :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  26 hcp but just 1nt in cards -rare case|pg||
nt|runnerup:  okk 8|pg||
nt|bt: he passed and after another double he bid 5@D which will go one down|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 1 game contract so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Here EW makes 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and 4@S for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Surely he had enough of a count to know North couldn't possibly have the K@H|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So it will probably come to South in third seat with a close decision, with 11 prime HCP and four @S I think most would dare to open.|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Great 4@s bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hmmm.  2@c would seem obvious for s.  Do they play non-forcing free bids?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At board 3, Göran Adde found a protective 2NT holding 4-4 in the ms after 1@H-2@H which lead to 3@D -1 and 4 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  EW will play 3N|pg||
nt|bt:  the famous 13-15, very unusual today. some people does not stayman w 4333|pg||
nt|jcwla:  West will show two suits, N does not have a bid.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now - has West shown specifically the pointed suits, I wonder.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I suppose either way East might bid 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Now NS are at a dangerous 3NT it seems.|pg||
nt|mamos:  i imagine this is some kind of three card rtaise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both these pairs play strong club which is ever so popular in Sweden|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (Negative free bids)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, as of the 5 level, their slam potential suit hasn't been mentioned.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H was alerted on South's side of the screen as showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: North was told it was natural (obviously)|pg||
nt|bt: south has an enormous hand here on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the +500 in 5@C X earned Team Zang 11 imps when NS played 2@H -1 in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a good spade game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petka:  the idea is that after 1C-1red-1M-1N west does not have to guess to bid 2C with 5+, and also that the stronger hand gets the NT. with the transfer approach the weak hand often is declarer, as in 1C-red(transfer)-relay-1N|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Which cna be made playing on clubs|pg||
nt|petka:  ok, nough about that, but many specs were wondering|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: even though I can't see why they would end up there :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strait forfard game should be -but so i thougth also in last board that they try 3nt -but no|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  What is Wikner's next move? He is a strong chess player also|pg||
nt|jcwla:  OK, an even bigger jump. West will probably raise with such good trumps.|pg||
nt|bt: 6@D a little better at teams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Moisant might the best, tough EW are 4-2 in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... it is now being introduced|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now it sounds like a queue bid in support of @ds?|pg||
nt|po-s: better than 5H|pg||
nt|po-s: if you play neg free bids this sounds more like clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: and can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he also plays precision so he's limited to 16 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Could 2@C be majors?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bt:  i wrote that before he bid :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks a noemal 4 @h = ,coffee board-but no 3nt it is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal|pg||
nt|kemperg: I hate bidding NT having a 4333|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if it was it was singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: (given the 2@S overcall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This will be interesting|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Or is it specifically @D and @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I don't think we know|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Ida?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Think they play it like most people in Sweden, showing @s + other|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bt:  i think the west hand is far too good for 13-15|pg||
nt|baldfriede: then he must havee miscounted @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Wd, they got there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda gained 15 imps on the last board when their EW-pair got a gift in the shape of 4@cX making|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 11 tricks even|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ok, maybe not good|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but at least decent :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz2:  910 isn't a score you see every day!|pg||
nt|po-s: as long as declarer doesn´t take two spade ruffs and then tries to establish hearts rather than use his diamonds this should come home|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: how would you play the board, PO?|pg||
nt|po-s: must admit I´m a bit influenced by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: won't make this time anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west in bidding his strength not his suits =support --|pg||
nt|jcwla:  If West did not have @D's, E was perfectly willing to hear @H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Clubs being out of the question|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: my partners alwayshave a hand like W|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, 4@S sort of carries a connotation of a sixth spade here, but W obviously liked the texture.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is only inviting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: on this board, for example, EW's style will give South a harder opening lead problem|pg||
nt|mamos:  it seems unlikely that declarer can go wrong here|pg||
nt|bt: some would upgrade here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, look at that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  new suit found on 4-level hmm|pg||
nt|bt: the fredin double :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzft: Everyone's waiting for north to make the lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff, then club finesse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strange, 20 count bids once, his partner volunarily with 2 count|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: def shd take the @D ruff and take this down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzeg: which she didn't have to consider :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3@D is actually worse than 3N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oliverc: good grief :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Missed game here by NS|pg||
nt|wygbe1: oops - 3n laydown|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = 4+ @S, 2NT = signoff somewhere|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt icecold.. 5@C depended on keeping @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south playes precision he has 1 @c opening |pg||
nt|runnerup:  this bidding beats me |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Looks like a make|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South was worth one more try with her eight tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, now i have some back up for saying that Bennet is creative at least :)|pg||
nt|muppe: easy 2@s, with @d  3-3  and @s 3-2 probably making an overtrick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: now the danger is spade ruff|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think declare should touch trumps here, might make anyway though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt: now 5@C maybe?|pg||
nt|bt: "I have AK"|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bt: this wasnt the worst slam ever|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|oliverc: no kidding|pg||
nt|baldfriede: hardly after this bidding|pg||
nt|bt: now 6@S looks very easy, what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|baldfriede: are we watching ladies?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes but @d must be set up before the 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos:  he will havwe worries because if this finesse had failed and there been another force life might have got very sticky|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well bid!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @h marked with South for the opening... so best to run to dummy and take @H fin i thk|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Hk|pg||
pc|s6|nt|po-s: ok, now he will probably go for D|pg||
nt|bt: a club finesse, club, then a diamond was the easy way|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzeg: Larsson-Berthaeu now in the lead since Grönkvist-Forsberg let 2@D through on 15|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes 4 @h migth make -@s Ace and @s -KJ in @h and @d -@s ruff and more @d -now west out of @s -and makes -but not easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he could have ditched a club on the heart return though|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: then pitch another on the queen later|pg||
nt|bt: he couldnt believe south had this huge hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|runnerup:  obviously 450 in this case|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The TD has been summoned|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: because of the alert/lack of alert of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that it showed spades has been proven|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opps extra room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bt: but this looks fine too|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Wrang is not fully content with the 4@s-bid it seems|pg||

nt|rodal f: We see the cards. They don't.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  there was that michael's to help but still difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I think South is all to blame, she could have tried 3@H over 2NT or 3@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: because you said S was a she|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: major suit battle here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: South is a female, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 5@D did not go only one down on board 4, it went three down doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: for a further pick-up of 12 imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Strääf didn't find a double in the same position as Wrang did (2@H-4@H) and that cost Zang 11 imps|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: finally we might see a game contract|pg||
nt|runnerup:  some discussion maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West thought 1@H showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Was a normal contract and will potentially be 5 imps or so to Team Yoda|pg||
nt|bt: nicely done, and slam was worse if dummy has @D4 and decl the 2 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: board 3 was a push as 3NT was let through at the other table as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Extremely important|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  south will keep west out of @s so..|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So survives the bid. Admittedly West had a lot of kings and queens for a game that can only lose two tricks.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|po-s: 1NT?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: not the best of slams here for  N/S, but it will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: For running scores, visit: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so the case is now with the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll go on|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok thats why he bid 1nt -no support |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: As you might have noticed EW play the most natural version of the forcing pass, letting all one openings be 4+ although limited|pg||
nt|muppe: yeah, the only thing that really matters...|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  both pass and 1@c shows 0-7/17+|pg||
nt|mamos:  3NT   a possibility here |pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine how they can bid to 6@D, though|pg||
nt|baldfriede: but will they find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he tried to bid as if he had opened 1@C|pg||
nt|runnerup:  cards still sitting nicely 7 @d on cards -6 ok to bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzft: ... probably not|pg||
nt|po-s: how  do you make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Inventive opening by W|pg||
nt|milton_se:  good slam - one finesse out of two|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A lot of penalty VP's have been dealt out during the last three days as teams havn't been finished on time|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@c as respons to pass opening|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy 3nt here|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so moysian 2 @d which playes well|pg||
nt|bt: in theory south has a clear pass, partner couldnt act over 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it explains that much :)|pg||
nt|turnip1:  yes, in a strange way...|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzft: so much for that :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hey ns has found a game 2ntX-makes ---but south run |pg||
nt|jcwla:  Would have liked more prime round-suit holdings, an ace or a void. And the @SA would have been nice for @D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3N is better than 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Typically 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  1@d = 0-7 now|pg||
nt|underdogg:  1@h 20+|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Just the auction s was hoping for.|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts will work but you may try spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  safe level 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@S is non-forcing, stronger hands would bid 1@H first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It takes finding the queen of trumps to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: That might indeed cost the victory now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  biercard also here 7 @d -bidding and play -can you have 2 biers if you bid and it is last also|pg||
mb|3D|nt|runnerup:  something to guess here -best if you find @h J |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 140?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not that obvious after the take out from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3NT was made by Larsson|pg||
nt|nilsland:  on the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she got a diamond-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not that it helps that much|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But they'll get to the spade game|pg||
nt|bt: yes i prefer @H, please dont take it seriously|pg||
nt|bt: now, he is tempted .... can partner have spades? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I don't think you deserve two beers for bidding this grand missing the @dK :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not here but in principe |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And also, in Sweden at least, it doesn't count if diamonds is trump. Is that a local rule or does it work that way world wide?|pg||
nt|muppe: South has nice controls, he should support @d now|pg||
nt|milton_se:  South has an excellent hand now - North showing 5-card @Ds, I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4+, but still|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|underdogg:  0-4/5-7bal 1@s|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c game forceing now from W|pg||
nt|runnerup:  open cards it is easy to beat by @d ruffs |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the warning came by 3NT, but team and IMPs cost.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: passing the buck|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I would have chosen 2NT over 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Any thoughts?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Might go overboard here.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thk W was right in pushing his p to bid nt in view of his black suit holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 1@H = @S, 1NT = 17-19 bal (upgraded)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once again east was too timid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @d small best now|pg||
mb|p|nt|underdogg:  since 1NT would have been 21-23, 2NT should show 24-25 something :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  110|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sorry|pg||
nt|bt: can east be balanced?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: On  1, Hans-Ove won 5 imps for making 1NT in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/89xozn4 for running scores|pg||
nt|mamos:  WEst had a strong  hand  too strong to just bid game also  but you were right uncomfortable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but 5@D is also a make so EW will only lose an overtrick imp or so|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Or ....|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|runnerup:  but I am still wandering if pass to 1 @s gets better score |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzft: np, just wondered if you saw something I didn't :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe North could suggest 3N over 3@S?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Definitely.|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|mamos:  as long as they stop :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In case of doubt lead trumps.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  migth have been 80 -if 13. @d will have been switched in rigth moment but not now|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so safe level was the idea|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  But he does not know partner has hearts too|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Easier for us|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: perhaps he finds Jx of heart a bit scary|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he don't use that card so much -thats why asked (6@h) important for some and bier you can think for any reasons|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: this looks to have been well judged by both pairs|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|vugraphzft: If he's 8 -12|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: Despite the lead directing 1@d - he gets a club lead :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: OR play 2@S at B15. Looks like a 1IMPer for Scania.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes P is showing 16 to 19 and he should want to be in game if he is 17,18 or 19.. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: curtains|pg||

nt|runnerup:  but you make this also missguessing so only overtricks|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Third-seat bids, especially third-seat white-on-red bids, have such a strong lead-directing connotation that I have a simple rule:|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that double to 4 @s scares south a bit -clever double with singleton|pg||
nt|milton_se:  Team SanSac back in business now- from 12-18 to 16-14|pg||

nt|runnerup:  if west can hold him self quited -he may have the previlise to defende not play @s|pg||
nt|jcwla:  South has a clear pass now. The opening was dubious enough.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Interersting pass by N - very disciplined|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West can make 2 H but N may try 2N|pg||
nt|kemperg: no dbl , only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  how wrong I was - 1 @s wasn't in my mind -double perhaps was ,,not perfect double of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1NT might be Raptor|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@h is a constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You're quite right|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Nice bid by W to show some values.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: It doesn't neccessarily have to be unlucky|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petka:  I wonder if double is for penalties here? Or is it takeout?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  should be penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: They haven't played with each other for long so I don't know if they have discussed it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will be exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Rimstedt-Grönkvist leading, both other tables made 3NT on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Their cc doesn't mention any unusal 1NT-overcall that I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_files/tavling/deklarationer/TA1.pdf|pg||
nt|bt:  you are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: http://tinyurl.com/cpx9t65 for running scores of all matches|pg||
nt|bt: i agree on passing 1@S, but bergdahl rarely chooses the "normal" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  if south passes he bids 1@s and later 2 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: cheap save in 4d over 3n for ns|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: what about 6@c on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this is a standard 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Both 6@D and 6@S make|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Cards aren't situated brilliantly for EW|pg||
nt|bt: this is in sweden known as "polish scissors" 55any, less than an opening bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petka:  If this is it, then W must be careful to start with a low heart to the 9. But w must also set up the spades without aloowing a ruff in north hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Declarer may misplay it thou - you must duck the club|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: W knows E has @C lenght and cd have bid the vul 3 nt|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|runnerup:  east has bad suit but so much that he didn't want to pass -common situation with 5 @c -very dangerous but many bids -life is dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2NT is a rather nice bid, correctly interpreted it will lead to 3@D making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont believe that ew will find @d -lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Nice lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oliverc: On best defence, 3@S the limit here, but easy enough for NS to let 4@S through,|pg||
nt|oliverc: though, especially if South tries to cash @D tricks rather than leading their singleton|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Why shouldn't they? There is no point in playing 2NT now as natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: woho|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  doesn't 'otur' mean 'bad luck?'|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Thats what my dad taught me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in common tongue, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: in bridge circles it's appliable to loads of situations :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|runnerup:  ok conventional 1nt -killed that bid -now needs to stop in time -should make on 3-level |pg||
nt|baldfriede: S wonders if his 8 would be enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: making 4@S on 17 was worth another 10 imps to NS here, now ahead by 11 in the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thing is, this might now make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it can but line is far from obvious|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks good, and it's right-sided now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: You might misplay hearts after the overcall, perchance?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but here Scania can get some back|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: The trap didn't fall|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: trump shift?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well, this tells N where the @h are|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i meant not|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This will hold and S will exit a @S in preference to breaking either round suits. Remember as defender, you should avoid breaking new suits unless it's very likely to be right.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Usually kicks half a trick or more each time you do.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzft: South accidently dropped the jack of spades on the table. Director has been called|pg||
nt|bt:  accoridng to cc they dont play conventional 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Sjöberg is taking the bull by the horns|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct:  well he has 8 certain tricks so choices are find the @H10 or the @CQ or let the opponents find one of those card for you|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: ... He is therefore forced to play the jack of spades now|pg||

nt|runnerup:  to beat 3 @s you have to lead @h Ace|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: you take away the two-level from your opponents|pg||
nt|oliverc: very true|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A 12-15 NT, not that common|pg||
nt|runnerup:  standard 3nt ..continues|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with all the controls i guess Sundell shd prefer the @H contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tough lead for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i can count 10 hcp, and it's not like partner is going to punish me when he's pre-passed|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Uheld is Danish|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Interesting, double or 1NT with N? I think 1NT esp since we have seen 1@C could be short.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: pretty routine hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
nt|baldfriede: indeed not|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess he'll just launch into keycards now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petka:  4H looks nice here|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR B17 ended as here in 3NT with a @S lead. Looks as a push.|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  some carefull play needed like @c Ace and @h away now after @h A|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: could E make a take out now?|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Now with known 8-card fit E will probably bid 2@H.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzft: Hi again! After having evacuated the hotel due to fire, we're back and ready to play|pg||
nt|runnerup:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Markku|pg||
nt|jcwla:  This just seems to be guesswork.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: He passes with the words: "I'm too tired"|pg||
nt|turnip1:  And these 4 meet in final round|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nilsland:  3Nt is also making|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no double -ok but some of|pg||
nt|mamos:  it might be your opponents who punish you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Might have pushed EW into 4@H which partner can double|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Only 8 tricks here, unles there is a miracle|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@C = GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@H = 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The show must go on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Perhaps not the best argument but|pg||
pc|c9|nt|baldfriede: unless*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: May be less.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: if the opponents catching you is what you're worried about you should compare that to all the upsides of acting|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i dont think that it is easy to bid -claiming in declarer play is easy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: N has shown 45+/54+ in the minors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzft: 2NT = short clubs (4531/4540)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Dave if S can find out his P having the @Dj orany of the black queens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: The fire was not so big but could be put out pretty fast|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petka:  the spade situation allows 3NT as well, but 4H looks like a great spot|pg||
nt|baldfriede: But there is the Chinese art of Wu Wei - acting by not acting. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: lol :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this lead was not a success|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @d asking for longer major|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzft: 1@S-2NT, 4@H (void)-4NT, 5@H-6@S would be a rather standard sequence to the top spot|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so in a good day 6 @d |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This has chances|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nilsland:  Declarer dont know who has the @DA so will maybe play for clubs|pg||
nt|oliverc: the only lead not to give a trick away, but East will be continually endplayed here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This looks just as good|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this is not a good day|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not the most successful lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think south will bid 6@H to protect his @DKx or @CKxx depending on which ace is missing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and with 1 key card missing the side suit kings are vulnerable on the opening lead in a NT Contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: At the other table slam was missed after a brave 2@D multi by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so 11 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|mrdct:  assuming 4@c was a cue, south knows that the missing keycard is the @DA as partner didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: brave indeed... fortune favoured ..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nilsland:  and could go down then|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzft: if South, like North, thought 4@H promised a void|pg||
nt|bt: hey just dont realize its a standard 3nt|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petka:  after 2S and showing AKxxxx spades I guess she knows where the DA is :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  So South should play another spade|pg||
nt|runnerup:  should duck first as cards lay-now 4-0 in trumps beats|pg||
nt|bt: they|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzft: i haven't had the chance to read what 3@D is|pg||
nt|runnerup:  north is very weak for opening and south optimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 4@C set @D, 4@D = minimum, 4@H RKC, 4NT = 1/4 and 5@C asked for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|bt: north has an opening hand in most systems, except roth-stone|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 6 imps went "Sivves" way when 2@H went down in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Many people tell me it's a make now, and I agree|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nilsland:  and look like a woman with the @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but clearly, this was enough as North risked a raise|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Perhaps W could find a double here to show real @C's|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but we should remember we're seeing all the cards|pg||

pc|sK|nt|vugraphzft: i think 3@D denied a void (therefore 4135)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: is the West hand an overcall for you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: 7 imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Would be interesting to let that stand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  lol  I was only teasing  - Im sure you are right - It's true especially that you can bid 2@S  taking up all the \two \level space that makes bidding on this hand so attractive :)  certainly worked well herre|pg||
nt|baldfriede: W has a bomb shell fter partner S OPENING|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the 1@hx, I meant|pg||
nt|runnerup:  too late for @c .maybe if you start with @c you can beat that -ok partial figth here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzeg: This doesn't look too hard|pg||
nt|baldfriede: AFTER+|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: would be very impressed with West if he found a pass :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  strange system -no stoppimg place in 3 @c seems so|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in board 16 the other table in 6 @c but missplayed -ruffed 3 @s to table -for some reason |pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzft: routine 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess even slam might make with this incredibly lucky lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes.. 5-4 and 5 controls and Sis a 3rd hand opener|pg||
nt|jcwla:  The 4@S making on 17 was 11 to Kamras.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  3NT-1 in OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  On the @S-@D big two-suiter.|pg||
nt|muppe: Strange that N didnt balance with both majors here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Are N strong enough for 3@S? He graded down.|pg||
nt|kemperg: N has to downgrade, 4333 and to much quacks|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i look at the bad suit of only five cards and say it's not even close|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i prefer both pass and double to 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: double would work out great this time as we get to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Not the luckiest of breaks on this board either|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Will probably result in two down|pg||
nt|milton_se:  comes off cheap, though - just 150 or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: If you weren't with us before and have reacted on the strange bidding methods: Both pairs play forcing pass|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|kemperg: no score on board 5 also in 3NT instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: un expected pass|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west had 16 hcp -pass was covards bid -some bid must be there -1nt /2c --no pass|pg||

nt|mamos:  me too how horrid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on this lead lead, it looks hard to make 12 tricks however|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but no|pg||
nt|jcwla:  W has some clues not to go on now with @H double by N, probable balanced hand in E, no raise by S.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or we was wrong:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|nt|mamos:  EW  not enjoying this  set much |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: I expect most to not open the East hand in a natural system|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here it might drive partner to slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs careful play however|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i guess it depends on what partner counts you for, vul against not all my partners will expect way more than this when it comes to suit quality/trick taking potential|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true M... but exchange the @SA and @Ha and 4@H is a nice vul game..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 9 and run it, then discard on spade return|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sunsamvar: that cud be missed ina 1@S p 2@S sequence|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this lead doen't hurt -@s and you have some work for sure|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Time to get a @S on the table.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2@D showed some different hands, a weak jump shift in @H was one possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: well, Sivve might get back the imps they could lose on the last board on this|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS clearly did too much on this board|pg||
pc|dT|nt|baldfriede: I don't see how to avoid slam now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzft: 4NT was bid and interpreted as a signoff|pg||

nt|baldfriede: oh, oh. I'll eat my words|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but then u have to come in at the 3 level :)|pg||

nt|runnerup:  if you open 2nt -minors and has no way to stop in 3 @c when partner is weak that is strange .speculiar -not common what ever you call it|pg||

nt|jcwla:  "Who sent for you?"|pg||

nt|runnerup:  pre-empter has time to go to toilet =pass ..but not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the fascinating thing about bidding 5 over 5 is that you tend to remember that 1 in 10 times it was right to do it|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: East invited game with 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this might at least be a little interesting :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and when it comes to the bidding i prefer 1@S to 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the 4-4 fit usually produces an extra trick and all that|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Is 7-1-4-1 a possible holding for the 3@S bid? Okay, then partner contemplated you might have it. If it's not, your bid was wrong to begin with.|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Having said all that, I've seen many worse 5-over-5 bids than this. But this will be costly: -100 against +500.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: +300 in 4@S X won Scania 11 imps when matched up with +200 in 3@D X by EW|pg||

nt|muppe: does 2@s show both @s and @d?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yes, it's natural with 5@d4@s|pg||
nt|milton_se:  must be so|pg||
nt|muppe: then N may compete to 4@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|runnerup:  @s lead beats also|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3 @s and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3NT now  might get @C start|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, that 3nt appears to very wobbly to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i am not so sure about that, could go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i predict a push on this board as well|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jcwla:  Not sure why Upmark volunteered to raise a level against silent opps.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Seems like a hand you can choose what to do later, you are not in fear of anything they might do.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: They now have a healthy lead of 1.5 vp|pg||
nt|bt: yes of course, i forgot that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: They might end up in 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: just to continue my streak of not bidding as the players, I consider that a 3@D opening :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: over an opening 3@D bid West wd bid @Cs and cross the 3nt level|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which would have made matters a lot worse for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: no way with 3 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: especially now on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mamos:  sorry i was looking at EW  cards   -- i hadnt got as far as looking at 5-0  break|pg||
nt|milton_se:  S should be short in @Hs to bid and Q@S is a good card|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzft: Just like they did here|pg||
nt|muppe: wd NS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nilsland:  It still can be decided at the third table :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry everyone but I'm a bit nervous|pg||
nt|oliverc: struggling to see 8 tricks here, let alone 9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nilsland:  3 @C is the contract you want to be in|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@C = Gazili so 2@H = @H + @C|pg||
nt|oliverc: too much to do here, I suspect|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a loser in each suit perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but then again, it's important what partner will play you for|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|runnerup:  still a little chance to go off -@h guess -after @s Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: you don't have to lose a spade|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Both sides are in for a surprise with a singleton K dropping|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oliverc: well a big swing in prospect, either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: wow :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It was a hand similar to the s hand that allowed us to beat the mighty "Dallas Aces" in a short match in the 70s. We opened 1@h and got to 4@h vul, they opened 2@d  and played it there.  Everything broke and/or was onside and 4@h wrapped.|pg||
nt|bt: ns at the other table did really well getting to 4@H here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzft: isn't it likely that you lose two red tricks and two trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: correction, really well when it was making|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzeg: NS now tied for first|pg||
nt|wygbe1: could lose 2 diam ruffs, k of h, and club plus spade|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true.. but will get forced now|pg||
nt|mamos:  shortwning trumps wont be nice either|pg||
nt|friggi: duck|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos:  this lead means defence are on track to defeat|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: So here we have the last board of this match. The second match will start 20:00 local time, in 1 1/2 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i also agree with the no|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: :) South's defence cost his team a lot|pg||
nt|mamos:  its been a great set of boards   lots and lots of close hands and some great play and some less great|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Okay, here we have the last board of this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: A very quiet set this, impwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 14-10 to Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: the slam of two aces was a push against 5@S -1 at the other table (after a club lead with South as declarer)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: here we can see that we had an exotic bidding in the open room where North opened 2@C strong!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: last board for this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Ok, last board now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Seems like we'll make it on time despite the break for evacuation|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know ns system here but 3@H is a strange bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on this board Ragnarsson-Berg did well to reach the only game with a chance as the cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Okey, here comes the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Then we're ready for the very last match of the tournament where a lot is to decided|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Larsson - Bertheau bid and made 6 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thank you!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Yeah, the last board for tonight coming up. Tomorrow we have another three matches for you|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes, but I can't help feel that Ace and another Heart was indicated there|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the moral of this set seems to be -- play 3nt whenever possible|pg||
nt|friggi: I disagree - as a matter of desperation you should:)|pg||
nt|bt: ew got to 4@S here, nicely done, is this finally the hand fredin has been waiting for with all those ace leads against 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: It's far from over!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzft: Thanks everyone for watching, thanks to the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: +400 is a big result for Hans-Ove|pg||
nt|friggi: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mamos:  a friend of mine once told me that it was often a good idea to redouble because it was much harder to defend then  the defenders were less confident and more likely to err|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to imagine a 6 IMP swing to NS from here|pg||
nt|mamos:  its possible |pg||
nt|oliverc: possible but unlikely :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -this looks like 3nt ew so ew migth evenlise this match |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if Nopenened 2@C strong Sshd bid 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think maybe was some other meaning|pg||
nt|turnip1:  Was deliberate|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i checked with my sister (operator in the other room) and that was it meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: he meant to open 2@D?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -partial again -bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Important decision to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: help BUT feel... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: i just checked and it wasn't, declarer simply got 11 tricks when West ruffed air in clubs and cashed the ace of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: NS in the open room bid and made 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that's impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: *to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Team Yoda currently has a small lead: http://tinyurl.com/7rrm7az|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: but three other teams have good chances at the gold medal as well|pg||
nt|milton_se:  y, but they only have 16-14 in reality|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ctually 5 @D was off -but west helped -under leading @S ace was nothing but when he took 2 tricks by ruffing and @S Ace .his partner had Q and he 10 in @D if he sees to switch to @S his partner ruffs with Q and his 10 will beat 5 @D but no he|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: a rather dull last board as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: great 4@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: this contract looks like one down for 8 more imps to Hans-Ove|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup:  at board 8 -4 @s was made @d lead and small @d to get ruff(s) -not best idea -8 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: or, now it's a make|pg||
nt|oliverc: or making|pg||
nt|turnip1:  just made...|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  switched to @d and 10 and Q fall together|pg||
nt|runnerup:  that is well done (lucky ) --this time @c well placed but still needs a lot to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla:  so at most 24 hcp no monster fit - pushy|pg||
nt|jcwla:  and the play was not commensurate w the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: .. and then you add about 3 point because you play on the Swedish national team :)|pg||
nt|bt: bad idea :) but if he doubles they might avoid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/resultat/damer/trial3.htm for the results, table will be kept open until we know who qualified|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Rodal and Ida|pg||
nt|runnerup:  she sorry |pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and of coarse the specs ty all|pg||
nt|oliverc: K@S was obviously singleton and Declarer cannot pick up Kxxx in the South hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzft: but 3NT on East has some play|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on a heart lead it's actually cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: and West has shown 14-16 hcp with this sequence so he will at least make a move towards game|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Gazilli coming up|pg||
nt|runnerup:  normal game here |pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all-bye -some chances even for 170 here but surely 140|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Next we're broadcasting two of them, San Sac - Kamras|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzft: We'll be back tomorrow at 10:00 local time, in roughly 10h30m|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 12 tricks with this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: What what you guys have opened with the North hand?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup:  not this time -tx bye|pg||
nt|bt: maybe at some point ending the relays is possible?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzft: so Scania will win imps here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcwla:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 3NT as GF with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jcwla:  neither the extra @S nor the extra @C can yield a profitable @D pitch nor is there a @D ruff nor @H loser, all roads lead to rome|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|d9|nt|turnip1:  4H maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: that's my first choice as well|pg||
nt|turnip1:  But that could also be awful|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: of course :)|pg||
nt|jcwla:  So long for now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nilsland:  the slam dont make|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: we would like to thank Tofta Gård (our playing venue) for the magnificent service and help we've gotten|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West misinterpreted 2@D as GF facing all hands (the systematic meaning is that it's FG if West doesn't have the 14-16 hcp with 6@S)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: which explains his raise|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzft: South has found a great lead, let's see if they can follow up with a heart switch|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|friggi: S did well not to bid on|pg||
nt|baldfriede: double fame swing on the final board|pg||
nt|turnip1:  5 D making|pg||
nt|baldfriede: game*|pg||
nt|oliverc: why not? 5@D is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Thanks for joining us, Jordan|pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes tx all -bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: This is the last board of today|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: * of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: oops|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|nilsland:  should not make THAT IS:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: on  6 NS overbid to 4@S going one down and thereby giving Sivves 5 imps|pg||
nt|mamos:  rapid tempo at this table = 12 boards in less than one hour|pg||
nt|oliverc: tough contract, this|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thanks also to Roland and Markku|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: And the specs :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|friggi: just becaus the K is on side|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzeg: so Larsson-Bertheau have a huge last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: not that it's really necessary, this goes down unless they let declarer set up clubs (or spades)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Next 12 boards starts at 19:10, hence in 40 minutes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzft: North needs to switch the next time she's in but that shouldn't be impossible to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: actually it's rather clear by then|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Schedule will be slightly rearranged for the next segment|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west isn't very ambitious -pass to 1 @s isn't  everybodys choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: But we'll soon be back with the second half!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|kemperg: bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: U are right Germ. Sorry:(  Forgot the specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back at 9.00 tomorrow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: thanks all!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nilsland:  maybe some squeeze against N|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I accept that, but there's not much room for East to have the K@D after West opens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so you don't want to be in a game on a finesse over an opening hand?|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|h7|nt|friggi: my bid was 4NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: Tx all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|friggi: good @C and semi support|pg||
nt|friggi: can go very wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back at 14.45 with match 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: Suz - Team Yoda|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: see you all then, bye for now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: we'll be back 14.15|pg||
