mb|2C!|nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing precision or some other limited system?  If not, 4@h seems a little premature.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: there is the transfer reponse  (1@D) |pg||

nt|roswolf: invitational?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@C invitational I suppose|pg||
mb|2N|nt|penseur9: take out double by east?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: When the opponents open an artificial strong or multi-meaning 1@c it's usually a good idea to preempt before their hands can be further defined.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: S certainly gave e-w every opportunity to lead trumps for him, but they didn't cooperate.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not the best spot |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|andreasw:  small @c lead was needed to keep this in 9 i think|pg||
nt|murat e: other room playing 2 hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Most people who play transfer responses would rebid 2@h with the n hand to show a real fit.|pg||

nt|mcphee: S was a little pessimistic for imps last hand I think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: now can make 7 |pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu:  2Nt sh never be the final contract :)|pg||
nt|murat e: its good you came imps are flying around and i am alone here....|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: S didn't show  primary support of n (unless their x is abnormal), and n never began to show his hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C looser discard on @H, just contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andreasw:  im guessing this will be -1:) unless Stokka can guess @s K|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|peacokk: Im not sure why Hernebrink tried 1NT, looks pointless to me.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think east took 3@C as singleton or void|pg||
nt|penseur9: yet 4@S should make|pg||
nt|friggi: sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: play is interesting may well play a spade to the J!?|pg||
nt|mcphee: should run 10@D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|kemperg: @S for 1 down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe +2 on @S finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: @D suit hidden, and I wonder what 3 or 4 @D would have been by N |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is similar to the last board where with primary support n x'd an overcall instead of showing support.  A very difficult way to play.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might play neg frees |pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu:  @cxK in S = 7 tricks - in N = 9 tricks - so NEVER 2NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: In spite of all our dire comments, w can get out for -1 on good guessing.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|penseur9: looking like -1|pg||
nt|pelu:  2Nt = a fly-terminal - u go there to find yout next destination :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andreasw:  Topping the @s like a boss.. now topping @d aswell?|pg||
nt|penseur9: what do I know :)|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer can still take the heart finesse but 9 spot dropping from west he will be suspicious|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|penseur9: there we go|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|s3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: will probably settle for his top tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|runnerup:  ok every now and then you find partners hand is nice for your cards .but in a long run not so nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: i favor playing on @D before @S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the best defense:(|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  William tell them to slow down a bid! they are all playing insanely fast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but the spade play is tempting|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he has a problem with 5-3 on that line|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H that is|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Brogeland got on the board when EMA x'd 5@s at the other table.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|penseur9: running the @D would have been +2|pg||
nt|penseur9: now +1|pg||
nt|mcphee: when the opps discards can help you usually it is a good idea to see what they are|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andreasw:  Wd:)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|murat e: this board is a possible win for brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: big swing on 21 for Brogelend  ... OR in 3nt making for 10 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: any shapey 10 count |pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: In his own (Swedish) words: "Hjärnsläpp".|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@d = @d+M|pg||
mb|3H|nt|murat e: 4 hearts makes and 4 spades went undoubled in the other room|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 14-16 is correct|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry, lost connection|pg||

nt|roswolf: support with support - usually is winning bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S was a bit wild|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 3 down this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: 2@S 1 down??|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|mcphee: unilateral 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|murat e: surprisingly no dbl here as well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  After partners pass i like 1@s more.. here it worked good though.. 2@s should be -1 with right defence while with the lead 1!N is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: N has shown 14-16 6c@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: If s has the j (as happened), ruffing with the 8 gains a trick.  If n has the j it doesn't matter with which you ruff,  the j is going to score.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Seems that way|pg||
nt|kemperg: E not happy with the 2nd dbl, what to do??:(|pg||
nt|kemperg: not a penalty dbl, but??|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@s, 2@d, 1@h for defense on 24.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: The defenders need to get a trump promotion to set up a 2nd undertrick.|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Blid choosing not to divulge his @h there.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator rated the e  hand on bd 10 as 15.30 points.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=8+kq54+q+kq108763|pg||

pc|h8|nt|penseur9: going down a lot here|pg||
