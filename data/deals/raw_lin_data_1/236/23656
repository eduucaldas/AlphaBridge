nt|barnets: on the first board so 5 imps to schwarz|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|jbennet: still north has the chance for a plus by balancing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lev should not get excited by this -- his KQ of diamonds aren't pulling full weight, and his heart holding is very bad|pg||
nt|jbennet: as can be seen 3 cl makes if the defence slippes. (east must push a d thorugh.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|barnets: well judged|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: This will be a quick hand|pg||
nt|jbennet: how 4 sp went -2 a nice puzzle.|pg||
nt|kit: Safest play (assuming club continuation) is low spade -- guards against North having 3 spades.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Although I guess that could go bad if North has 7 clubs -- which is possible.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|barnets: no safety|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: He decided that was greater danger than North having KQx of spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: y east judged from the bidding that south could not eb void in spades.|pg||
nt|kit: right -- South would likely have bid 4@C with spade void.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Schermer didn't DBL because of system   and Chambers didn't cash because system precluded Schermer DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that for a catch-22|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: not 2@H ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do play transfers after 1@H-DBL  so 2@H raise is weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 5c went down one, i may have missed first pitch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS initial actions sound -- so no opening bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 4@D   hadn't thought about that option   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope i don't think about later |pg||
mb|2S|an|bad|nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited to 15 hcp|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|larrymori: if double were penalty, it would be a good shot but the double is "I have cards without a clear bid, do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs for Lynch playing a form of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both Schwartz pairs  2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well that's a shocker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think on first trick she pitched 7 of spades it was down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: yes intelligent would be pass it lol|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: if Sutherlin never shifts to @D there is end position for down 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: if minors flip-flopped  i wonder if Wheeler responds 4@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzfv: judi insisted down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she has wrote on her card down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: passell says she showed the worst|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: just so everyone knows, they were claiming at the end, but gary did ruff diamond and then he went down 2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cc469: sorry for caps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: re: other room bidding 7@H off ace ... check out http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|robinswr: Lynch does not know that the opponents have an 8-card spade fit nor does she know that they have a 9-card heart fit. She should pass 2@s. Passell with the four hearts would bid 3@h|pg||
nt|cc469: ... but still bid over 2@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Stansby opened 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: they went over cards everyone agreed|pg||
nt|cc469: INTELLIGENCE WITH A TOUCH OF CLAIRVOYANCE :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Glasson in 5@H undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C4 led in other room  not a great success for defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i might have missed first spade play by judi|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 3@H should promise either 6th trump or unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|larrymori: Lew had to play @ds to be 42 and could not take the pitch or else he would have a tap suit on him |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|robinswr: or a singelton spade|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah -- i hoped "unbalanced" covered that|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|robinswr: its the player with shortness in opponents suit that should be agressive. with three spades go conservative|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: mmm thank you as she sees Passells diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   only 100 honors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: worth discussion for all partnerships    a) is 1@S rebid obligatory when opener holds 4   b) if not, what does 1@S say about  @C length and/or unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry overcalled 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Radin meant 2@C as preference for clubs -- Deas thought is was artificial GF|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: art game force?   does Lynn think she rebid 1N???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even then ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no, she thought they were playing some form of XYZ (after 3 suits at the one level)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|larrymori: I am a frequent raiser not rebidding 1NT on small doubletons, it has a ruffing value.  One gets to play the 53 frequently and the worse that can happen is a 43 which does not have ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: to be bad|pg||

nt|ahollan1: they were also known as Roman Leads because of Italian Blue Team|pg||

nt|larrymori: at the other table, the light nebulous @d opener was followed by a light 2/1 and a hopeless 3nt was reached with the ns cards.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: you are looking at how weak she could be :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen advocating 1@H overcall rather than DBL |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that argument has been ongoing since the 1930s when informative doubles invented |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect she thot she was strong enough to double and then bid hearts, but the auction wasn't friendly|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|barnets: well I dont think they will this set after last time|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is interesting mechanism to have auctions like  1@S-1N//2@S to show good opener not quite right for normal jump rebid|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|larrymori: east has a hand which is not going to bid over partner's bid so 1@h to show where he lives  might have been a choice|pg||

mb|5S|nt|robinswr: if you play Multi, then you have 2@h and 2@s open as other than weak |pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: i think controls|pg||

nt|robinswr: 2@s showing 2 controls is too high|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not typical response structure for showing controls|pg||

nt|ahollan1: normally steps are  2@D=0/1  2@H=2  2@S=3|pg||
nt|robinswr: any response higher than 2@s does not allow you to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one spec suggests  2@S = exactly 2 kings|pg||
nt|cc469: I guess W bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: I like 2@s showing 3 kings or ak in different suits. 2NT shows ak same suit( very rarely comes up)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: lynn seems a little confused|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not 2N for 3-kings?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so are we -- and we can see the hands|pg||
nt|robinswr: because you want your partner to rebid 2nt more often|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6@s needs ace of hearts lead or ace on sides|pg||
nt|robinswr: good bid for this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: voice commentary calling for 3@C over 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely Bernstein worth another try here, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might have just asked RKC over 4@C|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you have 3 kings it hardly makes a differance who plays the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good chance passell will make this|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D=intermediate  [when vul]|pg||
nt|leroumain: 5@s the par:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intermediate is approximately a hand that would open 1 and would want to rebid 2.5|pg||
mb|d|nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might include hands that jump rebid their suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: East would havebeen declarerin 6@H next door, so it might have been a correct save by Jacobus, if it was a save. Only a club lead by South beats it, not that obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either Howard Schenken or Mike Lawrence first recommended altering strength of jump overcall based on vulnerability|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: in our match kasle had to lead an Ace from AQxx into a 2nt opener to beat a slam since partner had the king and they had 12 toppers|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to make a big play in diamonds to make 5@h|pg||
mb|5D|nt|larrymori: although a @s lead would have held it to 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chambers Neg DBL with Hayden's hand  --  that gave better chance for EW to find game|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not to make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lawrence in his book on Overcalls may actually have recommended THREE different meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i suppose impossible to stay low on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: short break|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  77  Glasson also 2@C overcall -- but Migry took control after the 4@C splinter   6@H North|pg||
nt|larrymori: I think I would have been tempted to bid game over that|pg||
