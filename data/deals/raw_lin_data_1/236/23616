mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: All players are strong and very experienced, oftentimes it comes down to the intangibles and a bit of good fortune :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|SF|mb|p|nt|minimeck: the modern "American" approach these days is to play 1nt over a major as Semi-Forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both E & W alerted 1NT, probably not noticing that she was a passed hand|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Exactly, they were thinking along those lines, over unpassed hands etc. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think as a passed hand it's standard to play 1NT as Semi forcing even if you play it as forcing by an UPH|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: Exactly, I missed the initial pass as well :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|minimeck: The logic being you will pass 1nt with 5-3-3-2 shape "and" a minimum hand, here Shawn's prime 13 felt she needed to rebid the 3 card @c|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|minimeck: This decision also depends on partner's opening style, if they will pass 11 counts, then you must take another bid over 1nt on these types.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: From an earlier discussion, I think they play it moderately constructive|pg||
nt|ritong: also, shamelessly resulting, it would have had the effect to shut opponents out|pg||
nt|ritong: after 1@h 1@s|pg||
nt|ritong: not that 3@d is a delicious spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: What would you view the logic for 3@d instead of 3@c henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no idea, frankly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: i think 2NT stands out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: perhaps she intended to develop her superb two suiter over a possible 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, she has 11 and pard sandwiched|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|minimeck: A good point by one of our specs, low heart would have worked better here, after a raise some will lead high when they are marked for 3 cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: This hand will likely prove to be an advertisement for opening on 11, by passing hands like this more likely to create a problem to solve one|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: Everything working? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well...|pg||
nt|minimeck: might need a diamond lead to beat it?|pg||
nt|ritong: a double would have solved that|pg||
nt|ritong: midred has 15, chances of a blue card are close to 0 imo|pg||
nt|minimeck: Certainly worth considering, if you think a diamond lead is the only way to beat it, it's well worth the risk|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  was he afraid of pushing opps to the game?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|minimeck: Although given the auction, partner will likely lead their best major, so hoping for something there is not "unreasonable"|pg||
