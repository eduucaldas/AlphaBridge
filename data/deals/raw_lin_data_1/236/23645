mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|3for3: migry upgrades to 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: continuing the trend of shrinking "strong" 1nt openings to what used to be considered weak nts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: 2c for majors|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think it will matter on this hand... Stansby doesnt have a bid over any type of notrump|pg||
nt|3for3: right, but they are still stronger than the min balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: it was a real weak in other room|pg||
nt|pef: opening 1d would have worked a lot better for n/s on this hand, although e/w might get too high|pg||
nt|pef: migry thinking about bidding, sprung thinking about raising.  |pg||
nt|3for3: migry not thinking id guess|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pef: oh, I bet she was--she's a very aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: migry not thinking (sorry)|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if the queen of @D was working she'd have an easy bid|pg||

nt|3for3: but well judged to pass|pg||
nt|pef: new joAnna's turn to consider bidding 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pef: or a more flexible double|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i prefer this sequence, pass then double to be more flexible|pg||

nt|kit: But is it so clear that 3NT will make?|pg||
nt|3for3: al long as you dont let west in|pg||
