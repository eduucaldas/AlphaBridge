mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|kit: Seems to me Landen had done his all when he bid 6@D.  If Lev had what was needed, Lev would have bid the grand over 6@D.|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: Fortunate to choose to play in hearts, the suit that splits badly.  If they played in spades, the suit that splits well, the defense can defeat 3@S with a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  that last hand is a great learning example for newer players. Since the opponents stopper in game, Landen risked 22 IMPs when he bid the grand, in order to win only 4 when the grand made. |pg||
nt|agumperz:  so that is exactly why the books say only bid a grand when u know it is cold.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|kit: The books overstate things, but you should have a better handle on things than they had here to bid a grand.|pg||

mb|2H|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|p|nt|larrymori: if double were penalty, it would be a good shot but the double is "I have cards without a clear bid, do something intelligent"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: re: other room bidding 7@H off ace ... check out http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|robinswr: Lynch does not know that the opponents have an 8-card spade fit nor does she know that they have a 9-card heart fit. She should pass 2@s. Passell with the four hearts would bid 3@h|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: worth discussion for all partnerships    a) is 1@S rebid obligatory when opener holds 4   b) if not, what does 1@S say about  @C length and/or unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry overcalled 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Radin meant 2@C as preference for clubs -- Deas thought is was artificial GF|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: art game force?   does Lynn think she rebid 1N???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even then ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no, she thought they were playing some form of XYZ (after 3 suits at the one level)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|larrymori: I am a frequent raiser not rebidding 1NT on small doubletons, it has a ruffing value.  One gets to play the 53 frequently and the worse that can happen is a 43 which does not have ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: to be bad|pg||

nt|ahollan1: historically the leads were used ONLY vs suit -- then they went out of style, now many use only vs NT -- go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they were also known as Roman Leads because of Italian Blue Team|pg||

nt|larrymori: instead of 2nt to allow 2nt with a flat hand min with 3 and the minor rebid with 5 and 3 to try to play that suit instead at the 3 level|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how weak can Bernstein be for 2@D?    |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: you are looking at how weak she could be :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen advocating 1@H overcall rather than DBL |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that argument has been ongoing since the 1930s when informative doubles invented |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect she thot she was strong enough to double and then bid hearts, but the auction wasn't friendly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: back to 5C, the end went fast but i am not sure she didn't misclaim|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|nt|robinswr: played by east you probably get a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here 6@H would have gone down, not at all certain in the other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: as South thinks Westhas clubs as his side suit|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: to be honest, i thought North was going to bid 2N but as non-force :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  doesn't matter here, but wouldn't you overtake @HQ at trick 2?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Finishing with a normal 3NT contract -- which might have interest in the play.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|barnets: def need to play hearts |pg||
nt|kit: Not even clear how to tackle the diamond suit, or even if diamonds should be attacked first.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: getting 3 diamond tricks is still only 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: nice shift -- now it gets interesting.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: looks as if to make he must block heart suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: When Lev gets in with the club and leads a heart through, declarer will have to go up to block the suit.  Not at all obvious.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Depends on whether or not he believes the queen of hearts was an honest card.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: not obvious but Lev did play the @HQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|kit: Here we go!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: drum roll.|pg||
nt|barnets: if the Q is true the @HK is right|pg||
nt|kit: percentage play by a lot is to finesse.  But if queen of hearts is honest ........|pg||
nt|kit: And East did shift to a small heart.  Still ......|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Jacobus has his head in his hands thinking about this|pg||
nt|barnets: both the low heart switch and the Q play suggest the play of K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: This is the last board of this set. We will resume at 4:00 Chicago time, about 1n hour and 15 minutes from now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: yes, and there is some restricted choice in favor of playing the king.|pg||
nt|barnets: well played|pg||
nt|kit: Well done!|pg||
mc|9|nt|bobholl: EW don't know position of T @H so play honestly|pg||
nt|barnets: break now|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone know how long /|pg||
nt|barnets: break ?|pg||
nt|barnets: more than one hour |pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   if @HA at trick 1 -- does East show suit pref  and if so, does SHE divine need for @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: board is reversed|pg||
nt|robinswr: 11 big imps for schwartz to  make it closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry finkel has long heart hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set     30 boards remain after a break|pg||
nt|robinswr: last board for now next set starts at 4:00 central time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 70 minutes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: and please thank the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: finkel is first bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Martha, Steve and Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: this may end the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good 15-18|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Thanks to you all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Radin's untimely false card on 82 is looming very large|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W doesn't have an intelligent bid|pg||
nt|larrymori: pass double 3nt all possible|pg||
nt|larrymori: west was never bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cc469: for minors|pg||
nt|larrymori: he might pass this|pg||
nt|larrymori: and needs a @s lead if so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from auction   hard to believe same cards in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: restroom break|pg||
nt|cc469: I must confess 3NT wouldn't have crossed my mind|pg||
nt|larrymori: if bidding that is the call|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: win 12 instead of lose 2|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, IF you think you should bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: so going into the last 30 boards Lynch will be up 13ish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must build a club trick as his 9th|pg||
nt|daman:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Diamonds will take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any reason to play @D to 10 rather than @DA @D toward Q??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: latter wins against either doubleton in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  does choice of @S4 rather than other room @S7 [2nd from bad suit]  affect your decision|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more interested in knowing whether there is a reason to play West for @CAK rather than East|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators   3N must be Unusual by Passed Hand   with strong NT auction would go (2@H)-2N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should have voice commentary again for the final segment|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cc469: best|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is a good lead, probably worked it out from the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: to make he needs to lead the @CQ|pg||
nt|larrymori: an he knows that dummy is short in @hs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has to protect against @C ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't think he can|pg||
nt|larrymori: he cannot do both|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: the slam now reflected in the score   Moss ahead by 2 again|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|robinswr: i see no logic |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I guess you arebound to get them right even after a club to the jack|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i suggest  seat belt and crash helmet for the final segment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's just for the audience|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice singleton for declarer|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|robinswr: up to 8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: if he led @CQ and took his pitches he would have made it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the reason is if east had @CAK he beats the contract by continuing spades, says Barnet. Good point|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can she handle a @H tap?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she in this case|pg||
pc|d5|nt|larrymori: so long as he gets ruff it is 1 down for 3 imps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: with Bernstein still holding trump Ace  seems defense prevails|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|larrymori: otherwise 7|pg||
nt|cc469: and a tie|pg||
nt|larrymori: could have risen to make it easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C ruff easier in other room where West had made takeout DBL of @S|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what else is there?|pg||
nt|robinswr: when i doubt play winners|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: now @SA and another @H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: kaboom|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: when a club is played East should insert the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Finkel playing for @D to be 33|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|larrymori: he is thinking about 33 in the minors but illogical|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Then you may play her for A9 doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|larrymori: certainly with axx he would have bid 4@c over 4@d with xxx|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|larrymori: new leader|pg||
nt|cc469: maybe we're in a repeat of yesterday's excellent women's match|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was 4 but no diff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting comment from spec -- maybe Schwartz should fly @DA to play back @C|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is what I meant by making it easier|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he's in a position to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as happened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 1 hour|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: final board for this table  [no, i haven't checked CoC for rules of tiebreak]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: again i am not sure it wasn't a false claim, it happened very fast at end on the 5cx|pg||
