nt|ahollan1: a strange twist to weak vs strong NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: worth discussion for all partnerships    a) is 1@S rebid obligatory when opener holds 4   b) if not, what does 1@S say about  @C length and/or unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry overcalled 1@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: art game force?   does Lynn think she rebid 1N???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even then ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no, she thought they were playing some form of XYZ (after 3 suits at the one level)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: but in XYZ  2@C is puppet to 2@D for signoff or invite|pg||

nt|ahollan1: historically the leads were used ONLY vs suit -- then they went out of style, now many use only vs NT -- go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they were also known as Roman Leads because of Italian Blue Team|pg||

nt|pef: right|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: and will she still lead a spade knowing partner has 4|pg||
nt|pef: I mean knowing dummy has 4|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Sprung has a "natural" spade lead, but she knows dummy has 4.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the defense needs to take the first 5 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a diamond will work, if they get back to spades fast enough|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pef: a spade was led by east despite south having bid spades--same rousinneau lead as here|pg||
nt|kit: But on a diamond lead, West will never return a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Campanile asks about J - shows the Q or shortness (Rusinow)|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to cover the second round of spades, since ducking second spade looks like a concesion.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see how Glasson can get it right|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, a heart was now returned by west and 3nt is likely to fetch unless declarer takes a club finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pef: and same thing happens here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|3for3: not an easy hand|pg||
nt|kit: Of course declarer does have to get the clubs right, but he will find West with 5 hearts so won't play West for 4 clubs|pg||

nt|pef: really?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how weak can Bernstein be for 2@D?    |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: you are looking at how weak she could be :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen advocating 1@H overcall rather than DBL |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that argument has been ongoing since the 1930s when informative doubles invented |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect she thot she was strong enough to double and then bid hearts, but the auction wasn't friendly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: why not 2N for 3-kings?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so are we -- and we can see the hands|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: yep  2@H opening is weak with @H & @S  2@S = @S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well we do have a swing potential here|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would not think that judi would have mis-claimed or gone down if she had it make|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good bid from Wheeler|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: either way, the hand will get a write-up|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|robinswr: 6diamonds does mak|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  92  other table not able to duplicate our result of +0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Campanile in 1N north|pg||
nt|robinswr: since hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|robinswr: just need 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will they even sniff at @D contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe now|pg||
nt|robinswr: north did support diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6clubs probably won't make:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has she shown real support  or just  not NT, not rebiddable @C, not @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: fly @HA  @DAK  then ???|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: keep in mind -- BBO running total is UN-official|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hopefully we can get one of the operators to keep room open until official results are in  [nudge/nudge]|pg||
nt|robinswr: if she had 6-5 she would have bid 3hearts over the double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|robinswr: might be held to 4 losing 2 trumps and a spade|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: play here not automatic, is it Steve?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: any chance that Bernstein leads @SJ??|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: sorry i asked|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|robinswr: she'll make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no worries with natural trump trick being short in @C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1:  79  Sprung in 2@S east|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: 92   1N was +120|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: where Deas rebid 3@S  Glasson settled for 2@S|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: thanks all    other table just started bidding 93|pg||
nt|robinswr: to win the match assuming scores are correct, moss has to bid 6@d on board 96|pg||
pg||
qx|c96|st||md|2SA8HAT95DAK985CA5,SKJT73HQJ6D7643C7,S652HK32DQJCKQT84,SQ94H874DT2CJ9632|sv|e|nt|kit: oh -- right -- if they lead it|pg||
nt|pef: there are 3 seven card fits on this hand. slam only makes on 1 of them (assuming a spade lead)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board. Everyone saying it was a great match and everyone was good|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|pef: with only 30 hcp and only 7 card fits unlikely, but we'll see|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|ART, no 4 card Major unless FG|nt|pef: after the light opening, south may just drive to slam with so many controls|pg||
nt|kit: light opener by North -- now it looks like they will bid some slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it just needed more drama   or   cowbell|pg||
nt|pef: 1s denies majors--interesting she did that|pg||
nt|kit: guess she miscounted her hearts :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless game force probably|pg||
nt|barnets: 6N also makes with no spade lead|pg||
nt|pef: I hope glasson and sprung decided what double here means|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: if West doubles, that will be important for spade lead -- if that's what double shows|pg||
nt|pef: ok, so we are almost surely getting a spade lead from east|pg||
nt|pef: but west might lead something else vs. 6nt|pg||
nt|pef: so still lots of drama|pg||
nt|kit: they aren't going to get to 6NT now after the double -- but they might get to the winning 6@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After Migry explained 1@s, Sprung alerted the DBL, but I'm not sure what she says it is.|pg||
mb|p|an|11-13 balanced|mb|p|nt|kit: Pretty hard to stop short of slam after the light opener looking at South's hand|pg||
nt|3for3: i suspect she will try 2@S now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Stansby alerted the pass of 1@s dbld - can't read her note sorry|pg||
mb|2H|an|!d and !h FG|nt|kit: may not be clear what is forcing and what bids mean now after the 1@S call denying a major.|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h shows hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm told it's 11-13 balanced any |pg||
nt|robinswr: unless game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: so 2@h shows 4 hearts and longer diamonds game force|pg||
nt|robinswr: should have played 1@s redoubled|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby may think clubs is the home -- it isn't.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: 520+ overtrick(s)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pef: this might get them to six diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: it has been suggested to me there is a squeeze on a spad lead v 6N when dec ducks|pg||
nt|kit: sure might -- Migry will like QJ of diamonds a lot!|pg||
nt|barnets: west guards hearts and east clubs|pg||
nt|stew: double here is big if North bids 3S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: this may be the winning bid by Migry|pg||
nt|pef: wow, this might win it for MOSS on the final board|pg||
nt|kit: Now Stansby may bid 5NT pick a slam -- and which will Migry pick?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: amazing|pg||
nt|kit: wow -- very well done.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: incredible|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid |pg||
nt|stew: and here we are!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pity those souls who will have to wait to read about this match|pg||
nt|kit: this is not over -- declarer still has to navigate the heart suit -- and can take 2 finesses|pg||
nt|kit: but opening lead is critical|pg||
nt|pef: yes, on a spade lead it probably forces her to play hearts 3-3 or an honor dropping|pg||
nt|barnets: not when east has 5 clubs that does not seem right|pg||
nt|kit: if queen of hearts, all over.  Otherwise, declarer will be aiming first to set up clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pef: because it means she needs to use the club pitch right away|pg||
nt|kit: East has just enough club spots to survive this lead|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will win in hand, play diamonds, and can overtake diamond -- then will play on clubs, making if clubs 4-2|pg||
nt|kit: when clubs not 4-2, it will come down to the heart suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|kit: Declarer may have a count on the hand -- but if not, can go wrong via restricted choice|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|s2|nt|slqslq: @h shtom sa 3-3|pg||
nt|kit: or possible showup squeeze with East having to guard the club|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|barnets: she could ducck a heart |pg||
nt|slqslq: ops sorry was private|pg||
nt|ritong: she will have to decide if west started with 5 or 6 @ss|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|s5|nt|barnets: then play winners making if hearts 3-3 or squeeze on east|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|nt|pef: she knows the distribution now|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: now 2 top clubs, and heart to 10 and jack.  Spade return.  Win ace, cash last trump, and East is in showup squeeze|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|pef: west hardly would have led a club with kqj of spades so east must have at most three hearts|pg||
nt|kit: So it looks like she will have to make|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: it will not be a decision  east is known with 3 @ss now|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of ottlik hand|pg||
nt|ritong: she could not pitch @c or @h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
mc|12|nt|ritong: great show  merci a tous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely amazing finish|pg||
