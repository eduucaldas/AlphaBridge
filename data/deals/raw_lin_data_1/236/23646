pc|sK|pc|d4|pc|s5|nt|kit: This is far from cold.  Declarer has immediate problem at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: It would certainly be reasonable to play small here, and if he does so he is down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  if declarer reads this as shortness and goes up, how does he avoid 3 @D losers and a @S?  I doubt that he will take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, how does he come to 10 tricks?  1 heart, 1 diamond, 2 clubs, and 5 spades (with the club ruff in dummy) are all that is obvious.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Chambers  1N opening would be good 15-18|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|kit: I admit that I probably would have ducked the heart, but Schwarts did better.  Now he has a chance.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: He may take ruffing finesse in hearts now.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: but that hand has no rebid over 1nt, surely 1nt opening right no matter what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems inconsistent to me -- if hand has extras, it is worth 1N if not, then shape says pass the non-forcing 1N|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: This looks bad for him, but he can recover by taking club finesse and ruffing a diamond in dummy -- thus taking 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Winning defense would be low diamond by West, but I don't see how he can realistically find that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a tough defense, but his partner passed twice with K9xxxx of @H's, so he knows he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could have ruffed with 7 of spades, of course, but playing for this exact layout is pretty double-dummy.|pg||
nt|warrens:  there are 16 HCP outstanding and declarer must have most of them|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: maybe they only pass with 5332 min|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|sQ|nt|kit: On a diamond play, declarer can still survive by winning queen, club finesse, discarding diamond, and ruffing high when necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: If defense can be that double-dummy, so can declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Now it seems to me that he has no choice but to hope everything works -- spades 2-2, club hook on.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|kit: only alternative is to play East for ace-doubleton of diamonds -- which is possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's either that or play East for Ax in @D's (since East has shown up with 2 @S's and 6@H's he's much more likely to be short)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll finesse, since it's a better % play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: but he might think that the reason West shifted to ace and a spade rather than a club is that West holds queen of clubs.|pg||

nt|warrens:  wouldn't ducking achieve the same result?  declarer would pitch a @D immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: because of their weak 2 structure, this 2h rebid is 14-16 points i believe|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: right -- doesn't matter when declarer scores his heart trick.|pg||
nt|stew: yes I think so, assuming similar play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@D interesting call   wish i'd thought of it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure of the inferences since 2@H opening is 10-13 with 6+ suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I thought this hand would be another close contract, but the club lead gives declarer 4 club tricks which should make it easy to make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Milner already advanced to Semi-Finals|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: With the jack of diamonds onside, probably would have made anyway -- all defense could get on heart lead is 3 hearts and a diamond.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|warrens:  on a @H lead, he'd have to decided which finesses to take, but since 3 out of 4 work and @H's are 4-3, should always make|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: I like Kit's philosophy about forcing bids - the're forcing unless you pass.  Just requires partnership understanding in the post-mortem sometimes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  85  [where Smith never bid]  Boyd overcalled Precision 1@D with 3@D    Feldman in 5@C south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Granovetter's guess ==  play 4@H rather than 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it is a fit jump is a real stretch|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|swanson: I like to use a 2@S rebid (over the "x-y-z" game frocing 2@D) as a minimum with no desire to bid NT.  Doesn't show five spades.|pg||
nt|kit: I don't understand going slowly with the East hand -- he knows opponents have spade fit and he will likely compete to 4@H anyway, so why not go there immeidately?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Landen in 3N East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @C @C|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: brutal having to lead from North hand after East has decribed his shape|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 4 to play  Schwartz over Moss by 8|pg||
nt|swanson: Is 4@S 'kickback' with this pair? (ace asking).  4NT would be a spade cue bid then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: problem... jill called "diamond"... other jill played thought she said ten of diamonds and now Jill L showed her jack and said I would never call the ten. CB thinks she said ten ...|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Kit is a believer that asking for kings does not show all the keycards - that way he can get to some superior 6NT contracts (as in this case - sort-of).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John, do you know origin of the term 'kickback' ?|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't know the derivation of the name 'kickback'.  It is an extension of 'redwood'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about kickback before redwood - but brain gets fuzzy [again] after that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: to my way of thinking, the big advantage of relay systems comes from blind opening leads, with declarers hand totally unknown|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was it Granovetter's bid that showed some defense?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|swanson: The way it is supposed to work for N-S here is that if North showed the @DK, SOuth would bid 6NT.  WIth the @CK SOuth would have to settle for 6@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from a spec  "Jeff Rubens introduced kickback in his series on the Useful Space Principle, 80-81."|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but who knows what hand North has for that auction??  not me  and i saw his cards!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Director decided that Bd 75 will not be played.  (Out of time)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C strong forcing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: another strong @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this definitely NOT responses they used playing Ekeblad's Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: does anyone remember responses to Ultimate Club??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again NS don't interfere|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S game force, balanced  at least it was last time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big club pair did well to get to game|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 3- suiter with 5-card minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually 16-18|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the problem isn't here   other room is bidding 72|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: True. Other room behind by a bd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Schermer have a courtesy raise?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: at least partial credit for this swing goes to .... system|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8+ BAL,  3@C=(41)44  3@D asks  3@H=1444|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ritong: you found russ in the audience?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it would take me a year to learn this system and an instant to forget it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget what?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i already forgot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the tough part -- envisioning hands that fit 4513 16-18 that still give play for slam  before just giving up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK instead of @HQ makes 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Axxx Kxx x AKQxx |pg||
nt|fabsayc: same example al came up with|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also room for both major Jacks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those wouldn't be great, but give slam a chance|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  EW playing  GUS  Granovetter Unified System   [all info from very reliable source]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think about this policy of removing boards  [when usually no associated penalty]|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: general invite?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a direct quote  "4NT was, i think, DI Keycard; first step = no"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no what|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no = not willing to show anything extra|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only a marginal game anyway, more to luck|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: best lead - but still 9 with @H finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently a slam invite, and 5@C said no interest|pg||
