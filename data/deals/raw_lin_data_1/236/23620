pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: The 3@s will give declarer some clues, I would expect them to go down no more than 1, on a cross ruff it is very close to a make|pg||

nt|minimeck: :) well said Al, it's certainly not a percentage play even with the pre-empt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when partner is passed hand -- preempts become very wide range|pg||
nt|minimeck: But with west being marked AK@s it is not beyond the realm|pg||
nt|minimeck: of possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: also, quinn opened 3@d previous stanza with AKxxxxx and @c K|pg||

nt|ritong: but this ki√ßnd of "history" is important when you have a heavy decision to make|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, when you tabulate the 3@s inference as not precluding the possibility of K@c, you would lean to the finese. |pg||

nt|ritong: it was very possible|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a singleton with a potential trump trick is not everybody's choice|pg||
nt|minimeck: This still has some trouble here, if she rises ace, two rounds of trumps, then leads up to the diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not so impossible -- assume natural trump trick so @D lead not necessary|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally underleading jacks is not appealing either|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: but here, mrs stansby had four awkward choices for her lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other match  4@S was -2 once   their other table bidding the hand now|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here diamond seems perfectly reasonable, club seems too narrow a target for my taste on a hand like this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Jills  [levin-meyer] are playing 3N|pg||

nt|ritong: slam is very difficult to bid imho|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sitting north  Disa raised 2@H to 3@H -- an interesting choice|pg||

nt|ritong: right, so south knows north has @h xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are only a couple of partnerships that still allow opening 1@C with 5@C & 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: which is not really incentive to go further|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question is 3@C -- some pairs require better hand, but even if i had that agreement, would do it because of @Hxxx|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: So much for having plenty of time for the last 4 boards!|pg||
nt|ritong: the double of 4@c suggests K10xxx|pg||
