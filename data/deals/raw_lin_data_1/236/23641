nt|minimeck: But with west being marked AK@s it is not beyond the realm|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: but this ki√ßnd of "history" is important when you have a heavy decision to make|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, when you tabulate the 3@s inference as not precluding the possibility of K@c, you would lean to the finese. |pg||

nt|ritong: leading a singleton with a potential trump trick is not everybody's choice|pg||
nt|minimeck: This still has some trouble here, if she rises ace, two rounds of trumps, then leads up to the diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not so impossible -- assume natural trump trick so @D lead not necessary|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally underleading jacks is not appealing either|pg||
