pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  the problem with this auction is that 3@h sounded like a game try|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you, even if North jumps to 4@h to show a second suit and slam interest|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  West would probably X 3@s too, so may make no difference|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  found a good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: very dangerous...7-4 at favourable :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps South misread the vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South will not like the loking of having only a pair of jacks in North's suits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hallberg opened 2@c on the North cards in the OR, which is what I would have done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is looking at 6 possible losers|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  but East is likely to hold one or both of the @sJ and @dA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that trick is doubly good news for declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: East a bit greedy perhaps |pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: We ahead of time - five mins to half time - we've played 8/14|pg||

nt|sybarra: @D looks good from either side |pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  OR has reached 4@h too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yorkbeach:  both diamonds are wrong but 10 top tricks and chances in 3 suits for more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed West has an immediate problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a spade return sets up a slow spade trick in dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out how freely North would riase to 2@h with only 3 @h by South's next bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when it is a jump to 4@h, they must play that the raise is neraly always 4 trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or possibly three with a singleton (e.g. 1=3=4=5 shape)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see one spade loser and probably two club losers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus work to do to avoid losing a diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  someone has asked why South has a poor 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are two flaws|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing 4-suit transfers, so East is trying to figure out why West did not do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeb: Breakfast just arrived for south :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does not say what 3@c means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: I wonder if 4N to play or RKCB - East thinking :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  session breaks do not necessarily coincide with when players want to eat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: Arms folded.  The breakfast looks tasty!  Hand some over here!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is having plenty time to work out what to lead if East declares|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a passive trump allows declarer to set up a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but S may rather eat breakfast |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so should be flat for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  firstly it is 4333 - no ruffing value and little prospect for developing long cards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it has no tens or nines - the average hand has a ten and a nine|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer ruffs two diamonds in dummy, he risks creating a trump loser if trumps are 4-1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  this is the last making spot but auction will not end here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W know E has spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: 5@s wrong bid says East and mechanical error, but South says he's passed, no direcotr call|pg||

pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  North's trumps are not ideal for playing in a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yorkbeach:  or to score a low trump via a ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  risk of missing a vulnerable game if you pass these hands|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will not score the @hQ but makes all 5 trumps this way|pg||
mc|10|nt|yorkbeach:  now comes down to the trump play|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would also have raised 1@S to 2@S with the south cards, i don't think the south hand is strong enough to bid this way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  losing finesse allows a trump promotion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if 1@s can be 7xxx, the immediate raise has its downsides|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it is close what to do|pg||

nt|vugraphzeb: What's happening with B9 in other room?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have 2 minutes to play this board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  South overcalled and Irealnd sensible stopped in 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ireland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|benjy:  Slam is not bad here, 2-2 trumps and it's cold and if not then you need the hand with 3 trumps to have four hearts|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yorkbeach:  not sure why the play is taking so long there :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  very unlucky for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: West is asking N about NS defence to multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: a big grilling :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: No multi in America says N|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: lost the play - sorry folks -|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  moist would lead a top club from the West hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  going one down |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would take early diamond lead to allow East a ruff and take it two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: East saying A@d and another would have been better|pg||
