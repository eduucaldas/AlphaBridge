mb|2S|mb|3C|an|diamonds|nt|3for3: I just like being IN the last segment of a close match :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|pef: a bit of a stretch defensively for a strong 2c opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|pef: but it may result in an uncontested 3nt|pg||
nt|pef: danny, they don't play precision, do they, 2c was strong, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: strong yes|pg||
nt|3for3: no precision|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C includes all 4@C 4@D and some 4@D 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: they may play 3NT   a heart lead and Q@S switch would be nasty   would have to play low twice  to have a chance to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on 81  2@S did make so only a 1 imp swing|pg||

nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: Chambers 2@C very wide range   (1@H)-3@C would have been 2-suiter  so a bit tougher for Schermer to find DBL|pg||

nt|ady: hi Henri|pg||
nt|robinswr: he must have played hayden to have only five spades|pg||
nt|cc469: guess he got it right:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: Schermer didn't DBL because of system   and Chambers didn't cash because system precluded Schermer DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that for a catch-22|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: grand possible in clubs on the lay|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not 2@H ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they do play transfers after 1@H-DBL  so 2@H raise is weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 5c went down one, i may have missed first pitch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS initial actions sound -- so no opening bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 4@D   hadn't thought about that option   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope i don't think about later |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited to 15 hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: would be clean to reach 6@c|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ritong: not sure how to proceed though|pg||
nt|ady: takes some bidding to get to 6 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: if double were penalty, it would be a good shot but the double is "I have cards without a clear bid, do something intelligent"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs for Lynch playing a form of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both Schwartz pairs  2/1|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs would have shown clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: well that's a shocker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think on first trick she pitched 7 of spades it was down one|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT will make   as diamond king with south   and spades behaving   even can make 13 tricks on very nice spade  lay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Landen in 3N|pg||
pc|d7|nt|larrymori: yes intelligent would be pass it lol|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: if Sutherlin never shifts to @D there is end position for down 1|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if minors flip-flopped  i wonder if Wheeler responds 4@C|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think a heart lead is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if  relayers would find 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: assume east minimum for their range|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfv: judi insisted down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she has wrote on her card down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: passell says she showed the worst|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: IF declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfv: just so everyone knows, they were claiming at the end, but gary did ruff diamond and then he went down 2|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cc469: sorry for caps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: re: other room bidding 7@H off ace ... check out http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|robinswr: Lynch does not know that the opponents have an 8-card spade fit nor does she know that they have a 9-card heart fit. She should pass 2@s. Passell with the four hearts would bid 3@h|pg||
nt|cc469: ... but still bid over 2@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Stansby opened 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: they went over cards everyone agreed|pg||
nt|cc469: INTELLIGENCE WITH A TOUCH OF CLAIRVOYANCE :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Glasson in 5@H undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C4 led in other room  not a great success for defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i might have missed first spade play by judi|pg||
nt|ady: think e/w will not be happy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 3@H should promise either 6th trump or unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|larrymori: Lew had to play @ds to be 42 and could not take the pitch or else he would have a tap suit on him |pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|nt|ritong: they will observe they have 31 with no really discoverable fit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|robinswr: or a singelton spade|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: so, expecting a push is not overoptimistic|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: yeah -- i hoped "unbalanced" covered that|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|robinswr: its the player with shortness in opponents suit that should be agressive. with three spades go conservative|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|robinswr: Larry Cohen's Law of total tricks is a great read for competing |pg||

nt|pef: I mean knowing dummy has 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|kit: Sprung has a "natural" spade lead, but she knows dummy has 4.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the defense needs to take the first 5 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a diamond will work, if they get back to spades fast enough|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pef: a spade was led by east despite south having bid spades--same rousinneau lead as here|pg||
nt|kit: But on a diamond lead, West will never return a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Campanile asks about J - shows the Q or shortness (Rusinow)|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to cover the second round of spades, since ducking second spade looks like a concesion.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: I can't see how Glasson can get it right|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, a heart was now returned by west and 3nt is likely to fetch unless declarer takes a club finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: and same thing happens here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|3for3: not an easy hand|pg||
nt|kit: Of course declarer does have to get the clubs right, but he will find West with 5 hearts so won't play West for 4 clubs|pg||
nt|pef: nope.  I lot easier to take the first 5 tricks if you can see at least three hands|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: really?|pg||
nt|kit: oh wow -- this is a really big play.  But will the defense ever work it out.|pg||

nt|kit: and the diamond was ducked!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: However, the diamond trick doesn't get her up to 9|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H or 5@D?|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: worth discussion for all partnerships    a) is 1@S rebid obligatory when opener holds 4   b) if not, what does 1@S say about  @C length and/or unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry overcalled 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Radin meant 2@C as preference for clubs -- Deas thought is was artificial GF|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: art game force?   does Lynn think she rebid 1N???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even then ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no, she thought they were playing some form of XYZ (after 3 suits at the one level)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|larrymori: I am a frequent raiser not rebidding 1NT on small doubletons, it has a ruffing value.  One gets to play the 53 frequently and the worse that can happen is a 43 which does not have ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: they were also known as Roman Leads because of Italian Blue Team|pg||

nt|robinswr: when there is only one trick up for grabs like the ending of the last hand. it can't hurt to lead the last trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another Drury auction|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H with 4-fit    how retro|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if people play Support DBL over this 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like it would be useful treatment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Schermer didn't have option to open 2@S [10-13, 6+suit]  but  they do play multi 2@D [weak 2M or strong 4441]|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: if one plays supp doubles, I would think it would apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how weak can Bernstein be for 2@D?    |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: you are looking at how weak she could be :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen advocating 1@H overcall rather than DBL |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that argument has been ongoing since the 1930s when informative doubles invented |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect she thot she was strong enough to double and then bid hearts, but the auction wasn't friendly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: back to 5C, the end went fast but i am not sure she didn't misclaim|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  49   in other room overcall was 2@S  Landen did NOT bid over 3@S  final contract 4@H East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't hold your breath for a definitive answer|pg||
nt|robinswr: unlucky that all three spades are offsides|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have to DBL either 1st round or over 4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Bernstein would like her 2@D call back :)|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: for those who've followed the Seniors event -- this match is 96 boards, not 90|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: that is interesting mechanism to have auctions like  1@S-1N//2@S to show good opener not quite right for normal jump rebid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told many top pairs have abandoned 1@S-4@H as splinter   note that neither pair splintered OR  used fit-showing bid on this hand|pg||

nt|stew: as Kit said ... why the 2NT.  Appears to have caused confusion|pg||
nt|3for3: i think 4@C over 2@H would have been KC|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unless someone can convince me -- i think Sutherlin shoud play @CJ or 10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   and then hook 2nd @S|pg||
