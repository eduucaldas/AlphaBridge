mb|3H|nt|minimeck: The 3@s will give declarer some clues, I would expect them to go down no more than 1, on a cross ruff it is very close to a make|pg||

nt|minimeck: But with west being marked AK@s it is not beyond the realm|pg||

nt|ritong: but this ki√ßnd of "history" is important when you have a heavy decision to make|pg||

nt|ritong: leading a singleton with a potential trump trick is not everybody's choice|pg||
nt|minimeck: This still has some trouble here, if she rises ace, two rounds of trumps, then leads up to the diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not so impossible -- assume natural trump trick so @D lead not necessary|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally underleading jacks is not appealing either|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: but here, mrs stansby had four awkward choices for her lead|pg||
