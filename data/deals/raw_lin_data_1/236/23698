nt|kiwibridge: looks so, welcome Jim|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is here http://www.abf.com.au/events/vcc/2012/|pg||
nt|wygbe1: its possible to make 6 nt or 6d, but kind of absurd - must guess to drop the spade king offside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes as a friend just pointed out to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish having a long think|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yep ish is in the tank :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|amarko: think 2@S shows 6  but underwiight opening|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bebechira: this was the first ever set vugraphed by Luke Gardiner|pg||
nt|bebechira: he will be a super star|pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic job Luke :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: To easy hahaha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the sub-moysian 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: without a spade lead should make, since declarer will eventually lay down the spade ace and get good news - on spade lead must guess to duck if east declares - really bad contract ...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weak 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks to Carl as well for big help|pg||
nt|cc469: ty|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am operating in the other room..but i can tell you this was afantastic session from Luke|pg||

pc|c8|nt|wygbe1: well they got lucky|pg||
nt|amarko: looks like -2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: guess Ish never intended @H but was useful to ask in|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wygbe1: can make by playing for black suit squeeze against north, getting lucky when spade q drops|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h was a natural bid thought even in their system|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|amarko: maybe some play to go  |pg||
nt|bebechira: i finished in the closed...great job here guys :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: happy Traian|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 4 more sets tomorrow |pg||
nt|amarko: hi Traian  wish i could be there  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I will when is start time?|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks to Gary, Andrew |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bebechira: we finished in the other room|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: though*|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wygbe1: however, as pointed out by willwats, there is a more legitimate play to make of a club to the 9, which of course fails|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bebechira: and of course to Luke who is a super star|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we also have Rashed and for a short time Frank'|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: exactly,if redouble promises 3+ in all side suits, then south can double 3d, otherwise the redouble serves no purpose|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: many thanks to Al,Martin and Andy for fantasticjob :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common for pairs that play  Texas or South African Texas  to still play the convention after interference -- if transfer bid still made with a jump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the difference   Texas  @D=@H  @H=@S    South African Texas @C=@H  @D=@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: west thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: blame Max Sapire for the name -- he adapted Jacoby's 'Texas"  and Max was from South Africa|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a bit bizarre, what do 4@d,4@H or 4@S mean if 4@C=hearts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: you mean directly over 2@S or after the 4@C bid?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no, 1nt-2@S and then 4@D,etc|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a guess   4@D=@D  and 4@H = i want to play 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 4@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S  definitely worth partnership discussion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of whether you play ANY form of texas|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: here we are for the last board of the day, dont forget to join us tomorrow from 10 local time |pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|kiwibridge: that should slow the auction for EW|pg||
nt|amarko: 4@H needs diamond ruff to defeat it|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is a great event...please next year put it on the "to do" list|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bebechira: many thanks Luke..super job|pg||
nt|amarko: from w that is|pg||
nt|bebechira: Melbourne is a fantastic city |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes it is been there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: last this set with the next to start very shortly|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can W make 3NT?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...so next year we want you here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bebechira: we will be back after lunch|pg||
nt|amarko: think 3nt cannot make on @S lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|amarko: wrong sided  but ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the match comes down to this :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Knowing 2@C is for majors, slight overbid imo, 3@H and pass or 3NT would have some play.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|amarko: looks like -1 also  cant get all tricks in defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|bebechira: starting again in 1h|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W would have been playing the NT so @S lead no problem|pg||
nt|amarko: spade lead from N  WILL DEFEAT 3NT  perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: 3N was a breeze but this seems ok too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bebechira: last board |pg||
nt|bebechira: back in 20 mins|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|amarko: only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1 and thanks all. Enjoyable close match.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wygbe1: 3n is clearly the best contract, with 4h down if the defense could manage a club ruff, but the 33 clubs make this contract easy as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|cc469: 12 tricks now with friendly @Hs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
