nt|ahollan1:  85  [where Smith never bid]  Boyd overcalled Precision 1@D with 3@D    Feldman in 5@C south|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: also.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Kit is a believer that asking for kings does not show all the keycards - that way he can get to some superior 6NT contracts (as in this case - sort-of).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John, do you know origin of the term 'kickback' ?|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't know the derivation of the name 'kickback'.  It is an extension of 'redwood'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about kickback before redwood - but brain gets fuzzy [again] after that|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: The way it is supposed to work for N-S here is that if North showed the @DK, SOuth would bid 6NT.  WIth the @CK SOuth would have to settle for 6@H.|pg||
