mb|p|nt|andersk: 3 NT only game makeing here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lokaty: will Kalita try multi?|pg||
nt|lokaty: yes, he has a great suit, but still in this vulnerability it is an action|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: @d honours are both on side, @s honours both off, so 4@h should be ok for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|udo: will SOuth push to 3 NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: 3@S splinter, maybe|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts or diamonds for e/w   |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: Pass or 2@H now?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|udo: and maybe no @S lead now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lokaty: lucky @D and @H distribution gives them 10 tricks I think|pg||
nt|andersk: I guess 1 @D is limited to 15, so South should probably bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like xfer back to @Hs|pg||
nt|stc: good start for defence, A@D and trump back|pg||
nt|stc: it is more difficult for E to play later the Q@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdd: 2@D = weak 6+ @H or some stronger hand with 5+@H|pg||
nt|viren169: Not the most robust of suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: And he did|pg||

nt|viren169: 4 trump losers and a club|pg||
nt|ady: easy 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: then she would have bid @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: obviously a bidding misunderstanding|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: The Norwegian team need this swing|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: I wonder what explanations were given|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: the other room played a quiet 4@H|pg||
nt|eggy:  Looks like a good save against 7C :)|pg||

pc|cA|nt|andersk: Now Odin Svendsen can set up 5th @C as 9th trick|pg||
nt|stc: something looks strange to me|pg||

nt|stc: This is Wladow pure, answers 4 Aces with 3 and bids 6@c afterwards !|pg||
nt|stc: and of course wins the board :)|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

nt|po-s: 2 x spades then D to ace, crossruff|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a make,,,,discard @S , crossruff,,,|pg||
nt|viren169: Now he will get the @S right to for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: sadly he cant get back to his hand very easily|pg||
nt|ady: seems east overcalled a comic 1NT and double from south  west Robson then2@C   and when that was doubled declined to run to the 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|po-s: but 2D might have been a better choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: and now making?|pg||
nt|hedyg: still a bit shaken up by the 6NTX|pg||
nt|eggy:  Maybe West thought it was a Staymanish rescue and the pass of 2C showed real clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: Last board - next set will start after a short break|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Note that the ladies play 16's; the Open and Seniors play 15!|pg||
nt|jaker: 7 of hearts comes into play|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The seniors are older, 16 would make them exhausted|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|3for3: good 4M here for NS|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@S seems about right here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin asks about shape for minor suit openings - with 3-3 open 1@c, with 4-4 tend to open 1@d|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: Meyers agrees.  Note that it is best (imo) to always raise some number of spades when strong with a takeout double.  Save the cue for when you have strong without 4 card support|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: I like 1@S rather than 1@H. Gives you the chance to bid 2@H next if partner forces you to bid again, without promising 5-4|pg||

nt|3for3: Agree, probably the only time in bridge when you bid 'down the line' with 44|pg||
nt|3for3: Saying that, I am sure someone will tell me another time!|pg||
