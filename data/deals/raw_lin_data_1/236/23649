nt|Vugraphzfd: welcome all to the 5/6  segment of the US Senior team selection trials|pg||
mb|2D|an|Multi|mb|p|nt|chorush: Wold has a marginal takeout of the multi 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: and he elected not to make one|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|kit: Stron club auction.  Natural positive response.  Will they be able to find out what they need?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: all bids x opening 1NT are artificial|pg||
nt|chorush: It would appear that Landen will make this, perhaps with an overtrick|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|pc|s7|nt|kit: he is too weak to bid 1NT, so I guess he has to bid 2@C and pray|pg||
nt|kit: Now North will probably bid 2@S, 2NT by South, and 3NT by North|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Which I believe will be a very interesting contract to play and defend|pg||

nt|chorush: I believe there is a mistake in the scoring|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfd: The player names have been updated|pg||
nt|kit: West will probably lead a spade.  Declarer wins in his hand, and which suit should he attack first?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: This lead is an interesting choice, and might well be successful.  Now East will have a long heart set up eventually if he can get in.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: In order to make this, I believe declarer will have to attack diamonds before spades to knock out East's entry.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfd: it should read sprung by 64 according to players at start|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chorush: The scoreboard gave Lynch credit for 12 imps when it was Schwartz that scored it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: So far declarer is doing the best he can, but West's 9 of spades may prove to be critical in holding declarer to 1 spade winner.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|kit: This looks like best defense , but it is still tricky.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|h9|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: Now if declarer plays a spade up, West can take his top spades and exit.  But what if declarer cashes top clubs and good diamond, and then plays jack of spades?|pg||
nt|kit: He has a count on the hand, so he should find it.|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT did go down in other room, so Schwartz has a chance for a pickup here.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Finkel:  "Nicely done.."; Schwartz: "Not always..once in a while.."|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: how weak are Woolsey's perfect-shape-takeout-doubles?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: two bds (76 & 77) are completed. I'll update the results soon|pg||
nt|chorush: I have been informed that the team names are reversed, so the scoring will be likewise reversed. Hence the true scoe is that Schwartz won 12 on board 16 and the score is Schwartz ...|pg||
nt|chorush: 52 Lynch 15|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Jill L explaining lead conventions to Cindy|pg||

nt|kit: And South might have competed with 4-card support and only a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Boyd - Robinson not combating any interference  waiting to see if West bids over 5@D|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Lall opened 1@D  made it easy for his partner to bid 3@D over a 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer in 3@S west|pg||
nt|kit: It just doesn't pay to let the opponents have it at the 2-level when both sides have a decent fit.  Those 5-imp swings add up.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kit: Even if they have a 4-4 heart fit, 3NT could easily be better looking at South's hand.  But the negative double does give North the option.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Landen opens east hand with 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think rubin-granovetter play that as intermediate 1-suiter in @D|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry @H5 was already good  that's why finesse looked weird|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it was automagic, gained imps al|pg||
nt|chorush: I think that Sam's overcall is looking for trouble|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: judges, we need a ruling -- did i type that prediction before the bid was made?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This is far from cold.  Declarer has immediate problem at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: It would certainly be reasonable to play small here, and if he does so he is down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  if declarer reads this as shortness and goes up, how does he avoid 3 @D losers and a @S?  I doubt that he will take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, how does he come to 10 tricks?  1 heart, 1 diamond, 2 clubs, and 5 spades (with the club ruff in dummy) are all that is obvious.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: for Chambers  1N opening would be good 15-18|pg||
nt|chorush: I hope that 4-2 fits are a specialty of his|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|kit: I admit that I probably would have ducked the heart, but Schwarts did better.  Now he has a chance.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: He may take ruffing finesse in hearts now.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: but that hand has no rebid over 1nt, surely 1nt opening right no matter what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems inconsistent to me -- if hand has extras, it is worth 1N if not, then shape says pass the non-forcing 1N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: This looks bad for him, but he can recover by taking club finesse and ruffing a diamond in dummy -- thus taking 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Winning defense would be low diamond by West, but I don't see how he can realistically find that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a tough defense, but his partner passed twice with K9xxxx of @H's, so he knows he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could have ruffed with 7 of spades, of course, but playing for this exact layout is pretty double-dummy.|pg||
nt|warrens:  there are 16 HCP outstanding and declarer must have most of them|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they only pass with 5332 min|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: On a diamond play, declarer can still survive by winning queen, club finesse, discarding diamond, and ruffing high when necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: If defense can be that double-dummy, so can declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Now it seems to me that he has no choice but to hope everything works -- spades 2-2, club hook on.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|kit: only alternative is to play East for ace-doubleton of diamonds -- which is possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's either that or play East for Ax in @D's (since East has shown up with 2 @S's and 6@H's he's much more likely to be short)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll finesse, since it's a better % play|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: but he might think that the reason West shifted to ace and a spade rather than a club is that West holds queen of clubs.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6N East looks like worst choice  of   6@H or 6NW|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid would promise 6+suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 5NT = strong invite to 7|pg||
nt|ady: only 19 combined hcp   but with hearts splitting 3-3   this may well make|pg||
nt|ady: if defence had started and continued diamonds   then 3 diamonds 2 clubs and 2 black aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Schermer's DBL implies they play ELC  equal level conversion  where correction of @C to @D does NOT show extras|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i got that from SSF -- need my spy for details|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D vs 4@H differentiating some/no defense?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1N any game force      3@D= 55 minors, short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly 2155   had other bid to show 0@H|pg||
nt|chorush: bidding 2 spades was at the lower end of values for the bid and north had at best a raise to 3, so maybe not|pg||
nt|barnets: I would bid 4 over 2 but I always overbid|pg||
mb|d|an|D's Limit+|nt|swanson: I like Kit's philosophy about forcing bids - the're forcing unless you pass.  Just requires partnership understanding in the post-mortem sometimes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  85  [where Smith never bid]  Boyd overcalled Precision 1@D with 3@D    Feldman in 5@C south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Granovetter's guess ==  play 4@H rather than 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it is a fit jump is a real stretch|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is an unusual convention, isn't it?  Passing over the X, now X'ing to show a limit raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chorush: they need some unusal conventions to cope with their 2+ diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: I like to use a 2@S rebid (over the "x-y-z" game frocing 2@D) as a minimum with no desire to bid NT.  Doesn't show five spades.|pg||
nt|kit: I don't understand going slowly with the East hand -- he knows opponents have spade fit and he will likely compete to 4@H anyway, so why not go there immeidately?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Landen in 3N East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @C @C|pg||
nt|chorush: a spade contract can be held to 2|pg||
nt|chorush: probably won't be but it could|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder what 3@H was ?|pg||
mb|d|an|TO|nt|ahollan1: similar to nasty explanations we used to give as college players    that bid shows the values for that sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  here 2N shows exactly 4144|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Now he is the one guessing -- and he guessed wrong.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 5-0 trump split is just proof that the Great Shuffler is NOT a benevolent deity|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  85  5@C went down   so  15 imp match with 5 to score|pg||
nt|warrens:  anyway, 4@D looks like it should make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|swanson: 6@H needs only a 3-2 split (and no ruff on the go), so is a good contract.|pg||
nt|swanson: Unless you're looking at all the cards.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: brutal having to lead from North hand after East has decribed his shape|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 4 to play  Schwartz over Moss by 8|pg||
nt|swanson: Is 4@S 'kickback' with this pair? (ace asking).  4NT would be a spade cue bid then.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: problem... jill called "diamond"... other jill played thought she said ten of diamonds and now Jill L showed her jack and said I would never call the ten. CB thinks she said ten ...|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Kit is a believer that asking for kings does not show all the keycards - that way he can get to some superior 6NT contracts (as in this case - sort-of).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John, do you know origin of the term 'kickback' ?|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't know the derivation of the name 'kickback'.  It is an extension of 'redwood'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about kickback before redwood - but brain gets fuzzy [again] after that|pg||
nt|ady: losing club will go on long diamond    fortunate lay|pg||
nt|larrymori: looks at first that a @c continuation was necessary but declarer can negotiate the @d position that the defense has to give|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: to my way of thinking, the big advantage of relay systems comes from blind opening leads, with declarers hand totally unknown|pg||
