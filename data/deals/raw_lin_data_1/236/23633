mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Appears to be a normalish 4@h here, alot of handling and the foul trump split will not be friendly|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ritong: especially when 3@s sort of denies side values|pg||
mb|3H|nt|minimeck: The 3@s will give declarer some clues, I would expect them to go down no more than 1, on a cross ruff it is very close to a make|pg||
nt|ritong: capturing the @c K, is a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Indeed, if they picked off the king will make even by drawing trump :)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: :) well said Al, it's certainly not a percentage play even with the pre-empt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially when partner is passed hand -- preempts become very wide range|pg||
nt|minimeck: But with west being marked AK@s it is not beyond the realm|pg||
nt|minimeck: of possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: also, quinn opened 3@d previous stanza with AKxxxxx and @c K|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: but this ki√ßnd of "history" is important when you have a heavy decision to make|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, when you tabulate the 3@s inference as not precluding the possibility of K@c, you would lean to the finese. |pg||

nt|ritong: it was very possible|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a singleton with a potential trump trick is not everybody's choice|pg||
nt|minimeck: This still has some trouble here, if she rises ace, two rounds of trumps, then leads up to the diamond?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not so impossible -- assume natural trump trick so @D lead not necessary|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally underleading jacks is not appealing either|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: but here, mrs stansby had four awkward choices for her lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: in other match  4@S was -2 once   their other table bidding the hand now|pg||
nt|minimeck: Here diamond seems perfectly reasonable, club seems too narrow a target for my taste on a hand like this|pg||

nt|ritong: right, so south knows north has @h xxx|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are only a couple of partnerships that still allow opening 1@C with 5@C & 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: which is not really incentive to go further|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: drum roll or opening them from jaws?|pg||
nt|ritong: first, migry tanks, so clearly she not keen on raising|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Well now we can think about 6@h on a club lead :p |pg||
