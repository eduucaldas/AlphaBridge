mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kit: he is too weak to bid 1NT, so I guess he has to bid 2@C and pray|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: Which I believe will be a very interesting contract to play and defend|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: The player names have been updated|pg||
nt|kit: West will probably lead a spade.  Declarer wins in his hand, and which suit should he attack first?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: This lead is an interesting choice, and might well be successful.  Now East will have a long heart set up eventually if he can get in.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

nt|kit: So far declarer is doing the best he can, but West's 9 of spades may prove to be critical in holding declarer to 1 spade winner.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: Now if declarer plays a spade up, West can take his top spades and exit.  But what if declarer cashes top clubs and good diamond, and then plays jack of spades?|pg||
nt|kit: He has a count on the hand, so he should find it.|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT did go down in other room, so Schwartz has a chance for a pickup here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 11 more to Kasle    hoping for another come-from-behind win   [R16 was a squeeker until penultimate board]|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i can see now where 1N wasn't automagic|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-8 HCP or maybe 9+ 4441 with 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might blast 3N with 8 quick tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: likely Drury by North, which will get them to 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|?|nt|fabsayc: it was automagic, gained imps al|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: judges, we need a ruling -- did i type that prediction before the bid was made?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|kit: This is far from cold.  Declarer has immediate problem at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: It would certainly be reasonable to play small here, and if he does so he is down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  if declarer reads this as shortness and goes up, how does he avoid 3 @D losers and a @S?  I doubt that he will take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, how does he come to 10 tricks?  1 heart, 1 diamond, 2 clubs, and 5 spades (with the club ruff in dummy) are all that is obvious.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: for Chambers  1N opening would be good 15-18|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: I admit that I probably would have ducked the heart, but Schwarts did better.  Now he has a chance.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|kit: He may take ruffing finesse in hearts now.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: but that hand has no rebid over 1nt, surely 1nt opening right no matter what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems inconsistent to me -- if hand has extras, it is worth 1N if not, then shape says pass the non-forcing 1N|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: This looks bad for him, but he can recover by taking club finesse and ruffing a diamond in dummy -- thus taking 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Winning defense would be low diamond by West, but I don't see how he can realistically find that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a tough defense, but his partner passed twice with K9xxxx of @H's, so he knows he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could have ruffed with 7 of spades, of course, but playing for this exact layout is pretty double-dummy.|pg||
nt|warrens:  there are 16 HCP outstanding and declarer must have most of them|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: maybe they only pass with 5332 min|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: On a diamond play, declarer can still survive by winning queen, club finesse, discarding diamond, and ruffing high when necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: If defense can be that double-dummy, so can declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Now it seems to me that he has no choice but to hope everything works -- spades 2-2, club hook on.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: only alternative is to play East for ace-doubleton of diamonds -- which is possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's either that or play East for Ax in @D's (since East has shown up with 2 @S's and 6@H's he's much more likely to be short)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll finesse, since it's a better % play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: but he might think that the reason West shifted to ace and a spade rather than a club is that West holds queen of clubs.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Kit is a believer that asking for kings does not show all the keycards - that way he can get to some superior 6NT contracts (as in this case - sort-of).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John, do you know origin of the term 'kickback' ?|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't know the derivation of the name 'kickback'.  It is an extension of 'redwood'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about kickback before redwood - but brain gets fuzzy [again] after that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: to my way of thinking, the big advantage of relay systems comes from blind opening leads, with declarers hand totally unknown|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfd: director rules ten stands|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|swanson: The way it is supposed to work for N-S here is that if North showed the @DK, SOuth would bid 6NT.  WIth the @CK SOuth would have to settle for 6@H.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from a spec  "Jeff Rubens introduced kickback in his series on the Useful Space Principle, 80-81."|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sounds very familiar|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: this is awkward for declarer with spades blocked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D @D ruff trump pitching @SK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  assume @S no worse than 42 from opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then @SK @D ruff trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to score in the set   Lynch over Larsen by 41|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but who knows what hand North has for that auction??  not me  and i saw his cards!!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfd: Director decided that Bd 75 will not be played.  (Out of time)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a direct quote  "4NT was, i think, DI Keycard; first step = no"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no what|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no = not willing to show anything extra|pg||
