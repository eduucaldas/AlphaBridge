nt|ahollan1: other table bidding  60|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary talking about longevity of pairs|pg||
nt|robinswr: multi auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: Lynch has chance to tie the match here|pg||
nt|leroumain: could they find 5@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=weak 2 in major or 20+ 4441|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   need to find their way to game in no-trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACBL written defense   http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he's playing option 2 then he should pass and double 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hayden looking over the notes|pg||
nt|robinswr: playing the strong option means that chambers can't pass 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spoiler alert    90 is worth waiting for|pg||
nt|ritong: shhh|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes but there are much weaker hands to do that too, option 2 there is not much of an option but that though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: others bathroom/water break|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said to overcall 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve   which option do you play?    or do you have your own defense??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass then double surely does not convey strength of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Steve -- when did you start playing with Peter?   my guess 79 or 80|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1980|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: the deadly 2N here??|pg||
nt|robinswr: since hearts are 3-3 4spades makes five ( can one imp make a differance here?)|pg||
nt|cc469: 2 different ways of scoring 150|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't like michaels with 6-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i lost 3 years in a row in district R16 of GNT [79-81]  i knew i was close |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=intermediate  [when vul]|pg||
nt|leroumain: 5@s the par:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: intermediate is approximately a hand that would open 1 and would want to rebid 2.5|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some might include hands that jump rebid their suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: East would havebeen declarerin 6@H next door, so it might have been a correct save by Jacobus, if it was a save. Only a club lead by South beats it, not that obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either Howard Schenken or Mike Lawrence first recommended altering strength of jump overcall based on vulnerability|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|robinswr: in our match kasle had to lead an Ace from AQxx into a 2nt opener to beat a slam since partner had the king and they had 12 toppers|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have to make a big play in diamonds to make 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = pass/correct|pg||
mb|3N|nt|larrymori: although a @s lead would have held it to 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chambers Neg DBL with Hayden's hand  --  that gave better chance for EW to find game|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not to make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lawrence in his book on Overcalls may actually have recommended THREE different meanings|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i suppose impossible to stay low on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: short break|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  77  Glasson also 2@C overcall -- but Migry took control after the 4@C splinter   6@H North|pg||
nt|larrymori: I think I would have been tempted to bid game over that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would guess Vanderbilt thought of it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andrew confirms Schenken got there first|pg||
nt|robinswr: so this is a takeout double as if they opened 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: iron mike charges|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we lost net connection..now relinked|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cc469: needed tov divine small @C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 6 you have to|pg||
nt|robinswr: make 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: schwartz is currently ahead 20|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|robinswr: 20|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we lost all scores from this segment|pg||
nt|robinswr: assuming the scores were correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: let me check with Jan Martel|pg||
nt|ritong: as long as we have comparisons for last two is ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we hear a group   oy        ok, i'll settle for group groan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless   keep in mind BBO scores are always unofficial|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 1 imp to Moss on 90   still no pure pushes|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many of you recognize the name Howard Schenken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except at beginning of set|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: commercial message:   KnR [kaplan rubens hand evaluator] says North hand only worth 11.65  i.e. NOT a game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: tables always opened with official running total|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|robinswr: even then they have to be entered by a person|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: played by east you probably get a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here 6@H would have gone down, not at all certain in the other room|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as South thinks Westhas clubs as his side suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: to be honest, i thought North was going to bid 2N but as non-force :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  doesn't matter here, but wouldn't you overtake @HQ at trick 2?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
mc|10|nt|robinswr: push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a soon to be  hall of fame person?|pg||

nt|barnets: final contract|pg||
nt|barnets: south bid 5@HX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: score before the last board (90) was Schwartz leading by 20|pg||
nt|barnets: if accurate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: right, if it was accurate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: thanks all -- apologizes for the system crash at a most inopportune time|pg||

nt|jbennet: violating the "rule of void" (and will inflict as usual a bad result).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: this was the score at the beginning of the set.  Now Schwartz by 20|pg||
nt|henryb:  Schwartz is up 20 going into this board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: Nasty problem for poor west ,will he really pull it?. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Landen still thinking re lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: auction is over|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think they can swing 2250 or can they ?|pg||
nt|barnets: I have NEVER seen a 20 imps swing on the very  last board of an important match|pg||
nt|barnets: in 40 years of bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: East thinking still|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w maythink they have lost on the last board Lev will have some words to say|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Landen didn't realize it was his lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   if @HA at trick 1 -- does East show suit pref  and if so, does SHE divine need for @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: board is reversed|pg||
nt|robinswr: 11 big imps for schwartz to  make it closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by many considered to be the best of them all thru early 70s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that reference   Jan Martel is being inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame this summer|pg||
nt|ritong: one|pg||
nt|ritong: ite missa est|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus in 4@HX|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry finkel has long heart hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set     30 boards remain after a break|pg||
nt|robinswr: last board for now next set starts at 4:00 central time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 70 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and please thank the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: finkel is first bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Martha, Steve and Al|pg||
mb|1D|nt|larrymori: this may end the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good 15-18|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Thanks to you all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Radin's untimely false card on 82 is looming very large|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cc469: W doesn't have an intelligent bid|pg||
nt|larrymori: pass double 3nt all possible|pg||
nt|larrymori: west was never bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|cc469: for minors|pg||
nt|larrymori: he might pass this|pg||
nt|larrymori: and needs a @s lead if so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from auction   hard to believe same cards in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: restroom break|pg||
nt|cc469: I must confess 3NT wouldn't have crossed my mind|pg||
nt|larrymori: if bidding that is the call|pg||
nt|ady: on a good day 6@D could make e/w    not a good day|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: win 12 instead of lose 2|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, IF you think you should bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: so going into the last 30 boards Lynch will be up 13ish|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must build a club trick as his 9th|pg||
nt|daman:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Diamonds will take care of themselves|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there any reason to play @D to 10 rather than @DA @D toward Q??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: latter wins against either doubleton in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  does choice of @S4 rather than other room @S7 [2nd from bad suit]  affect your decision|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more interested in knowing whether there is a reason to play West for @CAK rather than East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: non-americans want me to clarify   best american     i'll think about that :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: this would be more exciting if the margin was one imp|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators   3N must be Unusual by Passed Hand   with strong NT auction would go (2@H)-2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we should have voice commentary again for the final segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: best|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is a good lead, probably worked it out from the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: to make he needs to lead the @CQ|pg||
nt|larrymori: an he knows that dummy is short in @hs|pg||
nt|robinswr: congrats to schwartz who has qualified twice in a row|pg||
nt|robinswr: margin is schwartz +20|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other room Jacobus is playing 4@hX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: SSF [system summary form] doesn't talk about this   unexpected auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4nt by east?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they are NOT playing Precision    Passell-Lynch and Wold-Jacobus are the only big clubbers|pg||
nt|henryb:  But Lynch need to gain 2250 total points on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room    1@C-P-1@S-2@H//DBL[3@S]-4@H//P-P-DBL|pg||
nt|henryb:  The event crashed at the start of this board.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it sure fits Precision  but  unless they changed the agreement during a break   ....|pg||
nt|robinswr: ew are playing Precions|pg||
nt|robinswr: Precision|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: looks obvious, reg 2@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  Schwartz is up 20 at the start of board 90|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: has to protect against @C ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't think he can|pg||
nt|larrymori: he cannot do both|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'd doubt that chambers would not bid 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: we will be back shortly for an exciting finish of this match..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the slam now reflected in the score   Moss ahead by 2 again|pg||
mb|5H|nt|robinswr: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i see no logic |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I guess you arebound to get them right even after a club to the jack|pg||
nt|robinswr: this makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i suggest  seat belt and crash helmet for the final segment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's just for the audience|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice singleton for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: up to 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: if he led @CQ and took his pitches he would have made it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the reason is if east had @CAK he beats the contract by continuing spades, says Barnet. Good point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must guess @H for the make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|robinswr: its a very hard job that the operator does|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: can she handle a @H tap?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she in this case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|larrymori: so long as he gets ruff it is 1 down for 3 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: with Bernstein still holding trump Ace  seems defense prevails|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if he goes wrong -- that is only 15 imps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|larrymori: otherwise 7|pg||
nt|cc469: and a tie|pg||
nt|larrymori: could have risen to make it easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C ruff easier in other room where West had made takeout DBL of @S|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what else is there?|pg||
nt|robinswr: when i doubt play winners|pg||
nt|robinswr: and we thank them for messing up only 1 or 2 times a session|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @SA and another @H|pg||
nt|henryb:  So the only question is whether Lynch gain 4 or 15 on this board|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: kaboom|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: when a club is played East should insert the 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
nt|ady: thx all      bye|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: restart  soon   schedule says 2 minutes  but i'd expect 10-15 minute break|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Finkel playing for @D to be 33|pg||
pc|h5|nt|larrymori: he is thinking about 33 in the minors but illogical|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   congratulations and good luck to all of the USA Teams that will be going to Lille France in August|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you may play her for A9 doubleton|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|larrymori: certainly with axx he would have bid 4@c over 4@d with xxx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|larrymori: new leader|pg||
nt|cc469: maybe we're in a repeat of yesterday's excellent women's match|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was 4 but no diff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting comment from spec -- maybe Schwartz should fly @DA to play back @C|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is what I meant by making it easier|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he's in a position to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as happened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 1 hour|pg||
nt|henryb:  He will make this|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: final board for this table  [no, i haven't checked CoC for rules of tiebreak]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: again i am not sure it wasn't a false claim, it happened very fast at end on the 5cx|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: all clubs going|pg||
nt|robinswr: Schwartz and Finkel won the last senior trials but with two different pairs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   i assumed EW would cash their 2 winners|pg||
nt|henryb:  So the final margin is 16|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
pg||
