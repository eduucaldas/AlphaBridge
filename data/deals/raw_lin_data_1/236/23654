mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: not 2@H ?|pg||

mb|2S!|an|--> 2nt|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: Sprung has a "natural" spade lead, but she knows dummy has 4.|pg||
nt|kit: However, the defense needs to take the first 5 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a diamond will work, if they get back to spades fast enough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: a spade was led by east despite south having bid spades--same rousinneau lead as here|pg||
nt|kit: But on a diamond lead, West will never return a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Campanile asks about J - shows the Q or shortness (Rusinow)|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to cover the second round of spades, since ducking second spade looks like a concesion.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I can't see how Glasson can get it right|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room, a heart was now returned by west and 3nt is likely to fetch unless declarer takes a club finesse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: and same thing happens here|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|3for3: not an easy hand|pg||
nt|kit: Of course declarer does have to get the clubs right, but he will find West with 5 hearts so won't play West for 4 clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: she'll actually describe more of her hand than Bernstein because of Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a strange twist to weak vs strong NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: worth discussion for all partnerships    a) is 1@S rebid obligatory when opener holds 4   b) if not, what does 1@S say about  @C length and/or unbalanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry overcalled 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Radin meant 2@C as preference for clubs -- Deas thought is was artificial GF|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: art game force?   does Lynn think she rebid 1N???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even then ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no, she thought they were playing some form of XYZ (after 3 suits at the one level)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|larrymori: I am a frequent raiser not rebidding 1NT on small doubletons, it has a ruffing value.  One gets to play the 53 frequently and the worse that can happen is a 43 which does not have ...|pg||
nt|larrymori: to be bad|pg||

nt|ahollan1: historically the leads were used ONLY vs suit -- then they went out of style, now many use only vs NT -- go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they were also known as Roman Leads because of Italian Blue Team|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how weak can Bernstein be for 2@D?    |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: you are looking at how weak she could be :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen advocating 1@H overcall rather than DBL |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that argument has been ongoing since the 1930s when informative doubles invented |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I suspect she thot she was strong enough to double and then bid hearts, but the auction wasn't friendly|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pef: so it will come down to the final board.  SPRUNG will need to bid a slam and make it on that hand as you'll see|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Joe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   if @HA at trick 1 -- does East show suit pref  and if so, does SHE divine need for @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: board is reversed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry finkel has long heart hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and please thank the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: finkel is first bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|larrymori: this may end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Radin's untimely false card on 82 is looming very large|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: W doesn't have an intelligent bid|pg||
nt|larrymori: pass double 3nt all possible|pg||
nt|larrymori: west was never bidding|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cc469: for minors|pg||
nt|larrymori: he might pass this|pg||
nt|larrymori: and needs a @s lead if so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from auction   hard to believe same cards in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: restroom break|pg||
nt|cc469: I must confess 3NT wouldn't have crossed my mind|pg||
nt|larrymori: if bidding that is the call|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: win 12 instead of lose 2|pg||
nt|cc469: yes, IF you think you should bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for the spectators   3N must be Unusual by Passed Hand   with strong NT auction would go (2@H)-2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we should have voice commentary again for the final segment|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cc469: best|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is a good lead, probably worked it out from the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: to make he needs to lead the @CQ|pg||
nt|larrymori: an he knows that dummy is short in @hs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has to protect against @C ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't think he can|pg||
nt|larrymori: he cannot do both|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: the slam now reflected in the score   Moss ahead by 2 again|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i suggest  seat belt and crash helmet for the final segment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's just for the audience|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice singleton for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: if he led @CQ and took his pitches he would have made it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can she handle a @H tap?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|larrymori: so long as he gets ruff it is 1 down for 3 imps|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: with Bernstein still holding trump Ace  seems defense prevails|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|larrymori: otherwise 7|pg||
nt|cc469: and a tie|pg||
nt|larrymori: could have risen to make it easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C ruff easier in other room where West had made takeout DBL of @S|pg||
nt|larrymori: yes 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what else is there?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: now @SA and another @H|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Finkel playing for @D to be 33|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|larrymori: he is thinking about 33 in the minors but illogical|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|larrymori: certainly with axx he would have bid 4@c over 4@d with xxx|pg||
mc|11|nt|larrymori: new leader|pg||
nt|cc469: maybe we're in a repeat of yesterday's excellent women's match|pg||
nt|larrymori: it was 4 but no diff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting comment from spec -- maybe Schwartz should fly @DA to play back @C|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is what I meant by making it easier|pg||
