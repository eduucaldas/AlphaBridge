nt|reisig: This hand looks like a 3NT ...no problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chorush: interesting hand. EW can make 4 spades because the diamond suit is frozen and he can effect an endplay|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|warrens:  since he knows the @S honors are split|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|chorush: Now it will be bruce's turn to work on an endplay|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see hearts split but dec cant may try for 3 hearts 2 spades 3 diamonds and 1 club|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|warrens:  and if S gives him a ruff/sluff in @S's, it's also over|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|barnets: Ira says 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|larrymori: this hand seems like a repeat of not wanting to get to involved when having misfit but 1@c does not have to be long|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: all they had to do was pass 2c|pg||
nt|afulton: Well, north certainly isn't bidding @h's when Schermer has just shown them... |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: needs to make 3 to tie the match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: +110 is a tie|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: he might do it|pg||
nt|reisig: We may be here all night :)|pg||
nt|chorush: 210 i s only 5 isnt it?|pg||
nt|larrymori: y|pg||
nt|barnets: last time I looked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry needs 140 for tie|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe they changed it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was thinking 5 imp lead, cant see for looking|pg||
nt|barnets: south can pitch a club on a heart so   |pg||
nt|chorush: they can hold it to 2 by taking 3 aces and 2 club ruffs but....they will be trying to beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: east can win|pg||
nt|warrens:  only a @C return can do it|pg||
nt|barnets: play heart heart|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: that may not be enough|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|barnets: but it reduces souths trumps down|pg||
nt|barnets: and east can duck @DA|pg||
nt|chorush: It is important to remember that the BBO scor is NOT official|pg||
nt|reisig: 140 getting closer|pg||
nt|barnets: a low trump now and yu tie|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any return 140 should be scored|pg||
nt|po-s: heart to jack and ruff will complicate matters|pg||
nt|barnets: nt so clear|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|barnets: east can duck @DA|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm sure he should have played a diamond to the 10 first|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chorush: he needs to lead diamond now, I think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|larrymori: it would be best to duck|pg||
nt|barnets: yes henry you are right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this line is completely safe|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, while he still had a @S in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck of diamond wont help|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont think so|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

nt|warrens:  what was the result on 86 and why isn't it shown?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: Great job by Rao, our viewgraph operator|pg||
mb|d|nt|reisig: tough hand here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|warrens:  good hand for going low|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|chorush: Ferguson will win the thir heart assuming there is one and lead a club. If West plays high, he will return to his hand and play another club, in serting the 9|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe west should have x 2@H|pg||
nt|barnets: the match is so close|pg||
nt|warrens:  best defense is now to duck a @S, which I imagine is pretty difficult|pg||
