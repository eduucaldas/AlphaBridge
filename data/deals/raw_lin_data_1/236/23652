mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  the problem with this auction is that 3@h sounded like a game try|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you, even if North jumps to 4@h to show a second suit and slam interest|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  West would probably X 3@s too, so may make no difference|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  found a good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: very dangerous...7-4 at favourable :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps South misread the vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South will not like the loking of having only a pair of jacks in North's suits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hallberg opened 2@c on the North cards in the OR, which is what I would have done|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is looking at 6 possible losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but East is likely to hold one or both of the @sJ and @dA|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out how freely North would riase to 2@h with only 3 @h by South's next bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  when it is a jump to 4@h, they must play that the raise is neraly always 4 trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or possibly three with a singleton (e.g. 1=3=4=5 shape)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see one spade loser and probably two club losers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus work to do to avoid losing a diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  someone has asked why South has a poor 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are two flaws|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW are playing 4-suit transfers, so East is trying to figure out why West did not do that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzeb: Breakfast just arrived for south :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does not say what 3@c means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: I wonder if 4N to play or RKCB - East thinking :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  session breaks do not necessarily coincide with when players want to eat|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: Arms folded.  The breakfast looks tasty!  Hand some over here!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is having plenty time to work out what to lead if East declares|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a passive trump allows declarer to set up a diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: but S may rather eat breakfast |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so should be flat for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  firstly it is 4333 - no ruffing value and little prospect for developing long cards|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it has no tens or nines - the average hand has a ten and a nine|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer ruffs two diamonds in dummy, he risks creating a trump loser if trumps are 4-1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  this is the last making spot but auction will not end here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does W know E has spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeb: 5@s wrong bid says East and mechanical error, but South says he's passed, no direcotr call|pg||
