mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: something wrong with the other room bids|pg||

nt|andyv:  hard to understand what happened in the CR...it seems that both sides may be playing some type of forcing pass system|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but N passed originally also and that was not alerted|pg||
nt|psyck: someone fell alseep|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: take out double by east?|pg||

nt|kemperg: on 5 in 3NT now|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very... interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@D opening there|pg||
mb|1D!|an|8-11|nt|sybarra: a bid tricky |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  15-17 NT|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|penseur9: 2NT????|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@c = 8-11 5+@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems pre-destined here|pg||
nt|peacokk: Looks like NS will have an easy auction to 4@H after a strong @C-opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|4!s|nt|santyclz: X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: ok 2@C is go for|pg||
nt|pelu:  this time the black Kings onside|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8-11 opening|pg||
nt|murat e: good evening erik hi roland|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@S = FG 5+@H|pg||
mb|2C!|an|strong relay|nt|andreasw:  3@s is the limit for N-S here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Presumably x is takeout.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  after east opening bid 3nt looks nice -but @s finess off and this 22 points 3nt would fail -of course in is not biddable and west in with 2 @s now so other story|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you don't leave this one in, when will you?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 @s very scary -if partner has opening hand and short @s -youll lose hundreds and ns makes nothing|pg||
nt|santyclz: And don't forget that pd opened in 3rd seat so may have a sub-minimal hand with short @ss.|pg||
mb|p!|an|balanced|nt|santyclz: Oh my.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: with the potential ruffs by W |pg||
nt|runnerup:  yes -on 1 level @s is ok -but 2 -level and strong hand behind partners -poss weak opening so pass is my tips|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bds running flat|pg||
nt|ady: last hand  n/s can make 4@H  on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes hard to bid it though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andreasw:  anyone for 2@s here? .. Show your decent 6 carder or show your 4 card support?|pg||
nt|ady: .|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they also make 3N on non @D lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: S was a little pessimistic for imps last hand I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now can make 7 |pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu:  2Nt sh never be the final contract :)|pg||
nt|murat e: its good you came imps are flying around and i am alone here....|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: S didn't show  primary support of n (unless their x is abnormal), and n never began to show his hand.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andreasw:  im guessing this will be -1:) unless Stokka can guess @s K|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|peacokk: Im not sure why Hernebrink tried 1NT, looks pointless to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: I think east took 3@C as singleton or void|pg||
nt|penseur9: yet 4@S should make|pg||
nt|friggi: sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: play is interesting may well play a spade to the J!?|pg||
nt|mcphee: should run 10@D|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: @S for 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: maybe +2 on @S finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: @D suit hidden, and I wonder what 3 or 4 @D would have been by N |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is similar to the last board where with primary support n x'd an overcall instead of showing support.  A very difficult way to play.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might play neg frees |pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu:  @cxK in S = 7 tricks - in N = 9 tricks - so NEVER 2NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: In spite of all our dire comments, w can get out for -1 on good guessing.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|penseur9: looking like -1|pg||
nt|pelu:  2Nt = a fly-terminal - u go there to find yout next destination :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andreasw:  Topping the @s like a boss.. now topping @d aswell?|pg||
nt|penseur9: what do I know :)|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer can still take the heart finesse but 9 spot dropping from west he will be suspicious|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|penseur9: there we go|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: will probably settle for his top tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|runnerup:  ok every now and then you find partners hand is nice for your cards .but in a long run not so nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: i favor playing on @D before @S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the best defense:(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andreasw:  William tell them to slow down a bid! they are all playing insanely fast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree but the spade play is tempting|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he has a problem with 5-3 on that line|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H that is|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Brogeland got on the board when EMA x'd 5@s at the other table.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|penseur9: running the @D would have been +2|pg||
nt|penseur9: now +1|pg||
nt|mcphee: when the opps discards can help you usually it is a good idea to see what they are|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andreasw:  Wd:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzaf: i have no time answering you, as u said, they play insanly fast.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzae: Neg. double wasn't in the system, but he somehow didn't like his @s.|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty, Magnus|pg||

nt|psyck: defense can still keep dec away from @d's as u suggested|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h5|pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: S admits that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|murat e: this board is a possible win for brogeland|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: big swing on 21 for Brogelend  ... OR in 3nt making for 10 IMPs|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mcphee: is this a wk NT or 14-16 15-17?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think 14-16|pg||
nt|mcphee: good raise from W|pg||
mb|2C|nt|penseur9: :))))|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: any shapey 10 count |pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: I became uncertain but there were really 6 more tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: In his own (Swedish) words: "Hjärnsläpp".|pg||
nt|underdogg:  2@d = @d+M|pg||
mb|2D|nt|murat e: 4 hearts makes and 4 spades went undoubled in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 14-16 is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: :) me included|pg||
nt|roswolf: support with support - usually is winning bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S was a bit wild|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 3 down this time|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mcphee: unilateral 4@S for sure|pg||
nt|murat e: surprisingly no dbl here as well|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andreasw:  After partners pass i like 1@s more.. here it worked good though.. 2@s should be -1 with right defence while with the lead 1!N is a make|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: N has shown 14-16 6c@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: If s has the j (as happened), ruffing with the 8 gains a trick.  If n has the j it doesn't matter with which you ruff,  the j is going to score.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|runnerup:  west choice was pass -helped east life but many would double -inspite of 4 @s |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: but ti worked|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: The defenders need to get a trump promotion to set up a 2nd undertrick.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ady: 4 hearts does make   so 3 down ok|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dQ|nt|peacokk: yes, I think Andersson should have bid 5@C on the way to make sure he get's a @C-lead|pg||

nt|andyv:  I would think the N hand is almost a classic for leading your shortest major |pg||
nt|psyck: chalk it down to a win for the forcing pass system|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mcphee: S has the trash, wants to raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm what is south thinking about|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: a dead grand slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S displays the STOP card. :)|pg||
nt|peacokk: Easier for NS in other room after a natural 1@D-opening, lets see if NS here can find 7@D as well|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, next (and last session in ?? min)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: i will ask W after this board :)|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Trump lead might have sunk this.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps north should have bid more than 2 @s with 4 good @s .but south raised 4 @s out of bidding bix -now ...ok this makes after @s lead|pg||
nt|friggi: dontbe offenfiveþ... Frace.. be polite|pg||
nt|murat e: hard to play this one quick claim is better|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|runnerup:  looks makeable after any lead but you surely dont want to be on 5-level -have to play tongue in the middle of your mouth as they say|pg||

nt|adonis18:  The @d suit seems to be lost in many games|pg||
nt|adonis18:  how could s pass 3 ut?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: I didn't quite follow, but according to N he had shown his @d but his partner didn't know that.|pg||
nt|adonis18:  well bid at the other table:)|pg||
