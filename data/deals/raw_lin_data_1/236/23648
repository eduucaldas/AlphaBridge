nt|pef: while we are waiting.  for those of you not planning to live another 110 years or so|pg||

nt|pef: go to http://venustransit.nasa.gov/webcasts/nasaedge/  for the Mauna Kea Observatory|pg||
nt|scotty: Sprung has a tough call on the first board - chooses 4@C - there would be votes for Pass and 3N|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: EW in danger of getting blown out of the auction here|pg||
nt|pef: or to http://new.livestream.com/GriffithObservatoryTV/VenusTransit for Griffith Park.  It's occuring right now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|3for3: ah, the impossbile 2@S to the rescue|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Migry "This was easy"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|3for3: ace of spades lead, then club shift|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|pef: hi, kit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|scotty: If partner were short in hearts, she would have very little defense against 4H - and doubling 4C might cause West to run on a weak hand with long hearts|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|3for3: entries a problem in 3nt; diamonds sit quite nicely, hearts less so|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|barbyh: 3 entries should be enough|pg||
nt|3for3: glasson didnt want to grab the nt with anti positional club holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: would you stayman and chance a poor split in 4@H here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: I would not|pg||
nt|kit: Close -- pretty much a guess IMO|pg||
nt|pef: nor I|pg||
nt|scotty: Not when my doubleton is strong|pg||
nt|pef: yeah if it had been two little clubs and qjxx of hearts|pg||
nt|scotty: And we have extra values|pg||
nt|kit: those factors (club honors, extras, weak hearts) all argue in favor of 3NT.  Might depend on how likely partner is to be off-shape for the sequence.|pg||
nt|scotty: As so often occurs, the 'normal' lead is not the most successful|pg||
pc|sT|nt|3for3: same auction and lead in OR|pg||
nt|3for3: migry might shift to heart|pg||
nt|3for3: to mess with declarers communication|pg||
nt|3for3: but she knows hearts are 33 for declarer, even though whatever honors are offside|pg||
nt|3for3: or perhaps a spade to try to hurt dummy|pg||
nt|3for3: anything but a @D :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: nothing matters with di's breaking|pg||
nt|barbyh: looks like 10 tricks are available|pg||
nt|scotty: But it is clearly correct - the simplest way to beat 3N is to find partner with the @sQ (or !a)|pg||
nt|kit: and it doesn't really cost anything on this hand anyway, as nothing defeats the contract|pg||

nt|pef: same auction and result on the first board of the set in the open room|pg||
nt|pef: Stansby's nice play of leading a diamond here gained an imp for MOSS|pg||
nt|scotty: South has a hand that is becoming a normal 3D opening, first seat at favorable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: she has already opened it|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|pef: 4 hearts by west?|pg||
nt|pef: yes|pg||

nt|pef: would you guys take any action with Migry's hand?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|3for3: looks like south needs to arrange an endplay against west....|pg||
nt|scotty: North will bid, even knowing her partner might be very weak|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: that assumes a spade lead|pg||
nt|scotty: East's action less clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: pretty hard for North to know 5@D is a phantom|pg||
nt|kit: And even a phantom works sometimes|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not crazy about 5 hearts at that. vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry asks about 4@H and is told no agreement|pg||
pc|dK|nt|3for3: with no overcall, west might lead a diamond straight off|pg||
nt|scotty: FOUR hearts would be more difficult for North to defend...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barbyh: missed the d grand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|3for3: well, no diamond lead coming now!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|scotty: In 5@h, she will cash winners|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||

nt|pef: and down 1|pg||
nt|scotty: In 4@h, she might have led @dJ at trick two, trying for an entry for a club through|pg||
nt|pef: So a six imp gain likely for MOSS who will be back in the lead by 2 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: First diamond presumably upside down count, thus the fast continuation|pg||

mb|1C|nt|scotty: Would you overcvall 1D as North?/|pg||
mb|1D|nt|3for3: migry upgrades to 14-16|pg||
nt|pef: continuing the trend of shrinking "strong" 1nt openings to what used to be considered weak nts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: 2c for majors|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think it will matter on this hand... Stansby doesnt have a bid over any type of notrump|pg||
nt|3for3: right, but they are still stronger than the min balanced hands|pg||
nt|3for3: yes|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but not a big deal|pg||
nt|pef: same as kit|pg||
nt|scotty: I like kit's answer|pg||
nt|3for3: not without the curse, though, scotty|pg||
mb|d!|mb|1N|nt|3for3: it was a real weak in other room|pg||
nt|pef: opening 1d would have worked a lot better for n/s on this hand, although e/w might get too high|pg||
nt|pef: migry thinking about bidding, sprung thinking about raising.  |pg||
nt|3for3: migry not thinking id guess|pg||
nt|kit: double might be 4 spades + diamond tolerance?|pg||
nt|pef: double presumably shows spades and at least something in diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: south's double might show exactly 4-card @s - with 5-card she'd bid 1@s|pg||
nt|3for3: 1nt likely=2@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes, I believe explained as such, though couldn't quite see|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: oh, I bet she was--she's a very aggressive bidder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: migry not thinking (sorry)|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if the queen of @D was working she'd have an easy bid|pg||
nt|lml: She is thinking she wishes she opened 1@D|pg||
nt|3for3: but well judged to pass|pg||
nt|pef: new joAnna's turn to consider bidding 2nt for minors|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pef: or a more flexible double|pg||
nt|kit: With 3 diamonds seems like Standby will bid 2@D|pg||
nt|pef: should east now bid 2h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i prefer this sequence, pass then double to be more flexible|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: not clear -- she knows it is is a 5-2 fit (no support redouble), so with 7 trumps vs. likely 8, both vul, odds seem better to defend|pg||
nt|scotty: Defense has 5 easy tricks, but the sixth is not so clear|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Most effective will be trump lead|pg||
nt|kit: and she found it!  Not obvious at all.|pg||
nt|scotty: Presumably, West was not COMPELLED to bid 1N - that also argues for defending|pg||
nt|pef: nice lead, gives up the possible trump trick, but likely holds declarer to 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|3for3: this got them to 3 :(|pg||
nt|pef: double by Sprung showing extra values|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to take the club ruff or not get it, and after that doesn't look like an eighth trick will exist.|pg||
nt|pef: she has to take the double club finesee now to  have  chance, but if west splits even that's not enough|pg||
nt|scotty: If she has AK and a ruff in hearts, it may be with a trump trick - and, in any case, if partner ruffs with a 3-carfd holding that might not be beneficial|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: and it looks like 3h will likely fail|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|kit: there is this thing about getting to the dummy Peter|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|3for3: In OR south had much less reason to try to push to the 3 level, they were playing her best suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pef: ah yes, minor point--was watching the venus transit since I probably won't be around 120 years from now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|d6|nt|3for3: so finding the better 44 fit backfired in an odd way|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: plus they were playing weak nts as you said|pg||
nt|lml: this will be disappointing to Glasson who might have expected 1 spade honor to be onside|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|scotty: After a high heart lead, I'm not sure if the contract would have been defeated |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|kit: I think it can be, but as you say not all clear.  Trump lead was very effective.|pg||

nt|scotty: north has a borderline 2@d bid - easier in the old days when partner always delivered 3-card support or extras|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 2d call by migry|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@C shows 'extras' via good bad 2nt|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|scotty: Looks to me like she's taking a very aggresive auction with her values |pg||
nt|scotty: But I would play 3@h as 100% forcing|pg||
nt|pef: so is JoAnn Sprung.  I think I would have let them play 3H|pg||

nt|scotty: Double then new suit facing free bid is forcing in Standard|pg||
mb|4D|nt|3for3: this one should be faster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: normal contract, although this opening lead will gain some imps for moss|pg||

nt|scotty: Migry thought it more practical to pass|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: Stansby apparently thought it forcing|pg||
nt|scotty: Yes, but I don't think ELC can apply here - S did not have to bid|pg||

pc|c2|nt|3for3: not that great; stiff k, only 3 card support, no spots in her suits|pg||
nt|3for3: ELC=Equal level conversion|pg||

nt|3for3: When you double and bid a new suit on SAME level, no extras shown|pg||
nt|scotty: High club? Low Club? no club?|pg||
nt|kit: I think East will shift to ace of diamonds.  If all partner has is Kxx of diamonds, that will be necessary to defeat the contract.|pg||
nt|3for3: same first 6 calls in CR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: She is thinking about this before playing her @CA, obviously knowing what is coming|pg||

nt|pef: in the Vanderbilt semis, two out of four players opened 1nt with a stiff queen, for example|pg||

nt|pef: 6n on this hand entirely on the club finesse because of all the good spots, but pretty unlikely to get anywhere but 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|3for3: with 30 hcp and no long suits, no reason to think they will even try|pg||
nt|pef: I suppose a tiny danger in getting to 6c after the 1c opening which happens to fail miserably|pg||
nt|scotty: Bridge is very tough - you have only 30HCP, you have wasted intermediates in the majors, yet slam is 50%...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: somehow 1@D seems like an underbid|pg||

nt|pef: do you pass with them quite likely cold, or bid 5c on your 4333 hand with two queens in the opponents suits?|pg||

nt|pef: well I did say a potential swing to Sprung.  It looks like e/w made a couple defensive errors after the lead in the open room|pg||
nt|pef: they had two chances to play trumps (including once when declare led a trump)|pg||

nt|3for3: well done to avoid 4@S here in OR as well|pg||
nt|pef: 3c was clearly a bergen type raise.  is it really clear to bid 4s on the north hand even at imps?|pg||
nt|scotty: east,s duck was sensible in the suit, but probably not in the HAND - if declarer needed more than 2 club tricks, she would not have played this way|pg||
nt|scotty: probably|pg||
nt|pef: a decent chance here for SPRUNG to get it back.  getting to six spades doesn't seem impossible|pg||
nt|3for3: not easy for sure|pg||
nt|pef: well plus she know that if declarer had an entry to dummy she would have more than 9 tricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|scotty: Pretty amazing hand to have when partner opens 4@s |pg||
nt|kit: well, West will have to really gamble to get to slam now|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: knowing partner has 4 trumps makes a 5431 stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: but...|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|pef: true, but it is still an 11 count with a big part of your hand a stiff ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and they do open all 11s.  yesterday I say Migry out a 5-3-3-2 10 count, so everything gets adjusted|pg||
nt|3for3: i strongly believe 2nt isright call for north here|pg||
nt|pef: for all west knows they have a 13 card spade fit|pg||
nt|kit: But it wouldn't be that unreasonable a shot -- even if 2 diamond losers, might miss on lead|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: But now, will North sit the double?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: they get to a lot of 22 point games with two relatively balanced hands|pg||
nt|3for3: migry agrees|pg||
nt|scotty: So what would you bid with S hand over 4@s Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: Nice decision.  West will certainly go to 5@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: will joanna stayman?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kit: I would bid 4NT (assuming I bid anything)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry thinking|pg||
nt|scotty: kit defines double of 4@s as penalty, unlike most experts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: JoAnna had a close decision whether to Stayman or just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: i think 4@S down stiff heart lead|pg||
nt|3for3: almost as good as slam|pg||
nt|kit: the bidding isn't over yet|pg||
nt|scotty: And is 4N 2-suited, 3-suited, or both?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: slow pass from Stansby, now Glasson thinking|pg||
nt|kit: I play it 2 or 3-suited, one of which is always hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: So with both minors you have to bid one, bid at 6-level, or pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: new leader, again|pg||
nt|pef: so a 200 point opening lead decision|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: and the tide turns again|pg||
nt|pef: 1250 a nice score|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|pef: yes, looks like 4 unavoidable losers.  Sprung may spring into the lead (sorry)|pg||

nt|pef: yeah, me too|pg||
nt|3for3: these have been some interesting boards...|pg||
nt|pef: six boards to go--time for plenty more lead changes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Players discussed score until Stansby looked it up on 5@S bidding card|pg||
nt|kit: and another 16 after that|pg||
nt|3for3: plus 16 more next set|pg||
nt|pef: yes, I meant in this set|pg||
nt|pef: it will be interesting to see who ends up in what on this board|pg||
nt|pef: probably 3c by east and double by south to start|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|3for3: we have 8 of en|pg||
nt|3for3: em|pg||
nt|lml: if you have eight you should open at the four level and Stansby agrees|pg||
nt|pef: migry is surely going to bid--probably thinking whether a slam try is worth it|pg||
nt|scotty: 4@h possible, but 3@h more likely, I think|pg||
nt|pef: wrong again on who was declarer|pg||
nt|3for3: east may jam them to 4|pg||
nt|pef: dealer I mean|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|pef: 4 hearts by JoAnna?|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@C = no jam|pg||
nt|pef: probably just 3|pg||
nt|3for3: 3 seems normal|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|scotty: 4@h would be way too much - your spade values have been lessened|pg||
nt|3for3: kq@S arent great|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: too likely to have 2 fast club losers|pg||
nt|pef: 6 imps to Moss|pg||
nt|lml: so the "chicken" three diamond bid cost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: 3@h is plenty - perhaps even too much versus a free 2H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: not that likely, given you have 5 clubs assuming partner has 8 diamonds.  but even if you don't have two fast club losers, there is still a 12th trick to be found|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D caters to getting to 3nt, not sure chicken is correct.  Picture migry with Ax or Axx of @D, and one fewer ace|pg||
nt|3for3: or 2 slow losers, peter :)|pg||
nt|3for3: 4441 is not the best shape either|pg||
pc|c5|nt|3for3: only 3 losers, but some work to do|pg||
nt|scotty: To make this declarer needs to ruff 2 spades, and guess @d - has to play almost double dummy, I think|pg||
nt|scotty: If W shifts to a @d when winning @sA, I think it can't be made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry left with cigarettes.  Someone should go tell her she has time for whole pack I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: This will be a slow one|pg||
nt|pef: while she's thinking--I mentioned this before, but right now the only time you can see Venus crossing the Sun is occuring (the only time unless you plan to live another 110+ ...|pg||
nt|pef: years).  There is also a solar flare at the same time.  Go to http://venustransit.nasa.gov/webcasts/nasaedge/ if you want to see it while you are watching this match|pg||
nt|kit: very slow -- Stansby can probably make, but she will have to do some good guessing.|pg||
nt|scotty: declarer might play to reverse dummy, planning to ruff one club low (not knowing 7-1 break), one with the @hQ, and pitching one on @SQ..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry comes back and leaves again|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Since they play weak notrumps, maybe 2@S is consistent|pg||

nt|3for3: and the spex for making us neccessary|pg||
nt|pef: JoAnna plays transfer lebensohl with me, not sure what she plays with migry|pg||
nt|scotty: West split her clubs in the Open Room, which made declarer's task easier (after she won the ace, and played S to K)|pg||
mb|3H|an|spades|nt|pef: and to Roland Wald for arranging the commentators and of course to Jan Martel for incredible work at all the various team trials|pg||

nt|pef: one more set of 16 boards to decide this match|pg||
nt|pef: it will be starting in about 15 minutes I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry wrote very loudly on pad and Sprung tried to quiet her|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pef: they got it played from the right side|pg||
nt|scotty: Here, West overcvalled, and stiff ace may seem very likely to declarer|pg||
nt|scotty: Good time to punish Rusinow leads by playing low from dummy?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Migry asked me earlier not to type so much, saying it distracted her, so I've been saying less|pg||
nt|scotty: Assuming that it IS Rusinow, and bnot a falsecard|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be a very deep play...|pg||
nt|pef: oops, and of course our quiet as a mouse operator :)|pg||
nt|kit: Finessing might cost if clubs 5-1, but if clubs 5-1 declarer is in trouble anyway so likely to take the finesse.|pg||
nt|3for3: it is Rusinow, yes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|3for3: they might have a good bad 3nt |pg||
nt|lml: 3NT was "friviolous"|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: sprung asked for cards to be left up.  thinking about hand|pg||
nt|3for3: Rusinow leads are second from touching honors|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|pef: JoAnna likes "non-serious" 3NT slam try|pg||

nt|pef: useful here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|3for3: good/bad or serious non serious or whatever you like to call it!|pg||

nt|scotty: When players ask to leave the cards up, it often means they have a problem on what to play to the next trick|pg||

mc|10|nt|3for3: a coup coming now|pg||
