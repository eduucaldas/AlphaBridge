pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: The player names have been updated|pg||
nt|kit: West will probably lead a spade.  Declarer wins in his hand, and which suit should he attack first?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: This lead is an interesting choice, and might well be successful.  Now East will have a long heart set up eventually if he can get in.|pg||

nt|kit: So far declarer is doing the best he can, but West's 9 of spades may prove to be critical in holding declarer to 1 spade winner.|pg||

nt|kit: Now if declarer plays a spade up, West can take his top spades and exit.  But what if declarer cashes top clubs and good diamond, and then plays jack of spades?|pg||
nt|kit: He has a count on the hand, so he should find it.|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT did go down in other room, so Schwartz has a chance for a pickup here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 11 more to Kasle    hoping for another come-from-behind win   [R16 was a squeeker until penultimate board]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-8 HCP or maybe 9+ 4441 with 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might blast 3N with 8 quick tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: likely Drury by North, which will get them to 4@S.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: judges, we need a ruling -- did i type that prediction before the bid was made?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: This is far from cold.  Declarer has immediate problem at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: It would certainly be reasonable to play small here, and if he does so he is down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  if declarer reads this as shortness and goes up, how does he avoid 3 @D losers and a @S?  I doubt that he will take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, how does he come to 10 tricks?  1 heart, 1 diamond, 2 clubs, and 5 spades (with the club ruff in dummy) are all that is obvious.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for Chambers  1N opening would be good 15-18|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I admit that I probably would have ducked the heart, but Schwarts did better.  Now he has a chance.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|kit: He may take ruffing finesse in hearts now.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: but that hand has no rebid over 1nt, surely 1nt opening right no matter what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems inconsistent to me -- if hand has extras, it is worth 1N if not, then shape says pass the non-forcing 1N|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: This looks bad for him, but he can recover by taking club finesse and ruffing a diamond in dummy -- thus taking 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Winning defense would be low diamond by West, but I don't see how he can realistically find that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a tough defense, but his partner passed twice with K9xxxx of @H's, so he knows he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could have ruffed with 7 of spades, of course, but playing for this exact layout is pretty double-dummy.|pg||
nt|warrens:  there are 16 HCP outstanding and declarer must have most of them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: maybe they only pass with 5332 min|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: On a diamond play, declarer can still survive by winning queen, club finesse, discarding diamond, and ruffing high when necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: If defense can be that double-dummy, so can declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Now it seems to me that he has no choice but to hope everything works -- spades 2-2, club hook on.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: only alternative is to play East for ace-doubleton of diamonds -- which is possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's either that or play East for Ax in @D's (since East has shown up with 2 @S's and 6@H's he's much more likely to be short)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll finesse, since it's a better % play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: but he might think that the reason West shifted to ace and a spade rather than a club is that West holds queen of clubs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|chip: EW play a strong club, 2D is a 3 suiter 10-15 with short D's. 2N asks and 3H is presumably this pattern exactly. |pg||

nt|chip: 3N is best with 9 top tricks, though 5C pretty also, and makes easily here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chip: I assume Wold is deciding between 3N and 5C. To see the merit of 5C imagine KQxx Kxx x KQxxx. |pg||
