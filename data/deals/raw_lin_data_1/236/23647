mb|p|mb|2C|an|5-7 less than 3 spades|nt|kit: he is too weak to bid 1NT, so I guess he has to bid 2@C and pray|pg||

mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfd: The player names have been updated|pg||
nt|kit: West will probably lead a spade.  Declarer wins in his hand, and which suit should he attack first?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: This lead is an interesting choice, and might well be successful.  Now East will have a long heart set up eventually if he can get in.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|kit: In order to make this, I believe declarer will have to attack diamonds before spades to knock out East's entry.|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h4|nt|kit: So far declarer is doing the best he can, but West's 9 of spades may prove to be critical in holding declarer to 1 spade winner.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|kit: Now if declarer plays a spade up, West can take his top spades and exit.  But what if declarer cashes top clubs and good diamond, and then plays jack of spades?|pg||
nt|kit: He has a count on the hand, so he should find it.|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT did go down in other room, so Schwartz has a chance for a pickup here.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Boyd - Robinson not combating any interference  waiting to see if West bids over 5@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Lall opened 1@D  made it easy for his partner to bid 3@D over a 1@S overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it was automagic, gained imps al|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: judges, we need a ruling -- did i type that prediction before the bid was made?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|kit: This is far from cold.  Declarer has immediate problem at trick 1.|pg||
nt|kit: It would certainly be reasonable to play small here, and if he does so he is down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  if declarer reads this as shortness and goes up, how does he avoid 3 @D losers and a @S?  I doubt that he will take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up ace, how does he come to 10 tricks?  1 heart, 1 diamond, 2 clubs, and 5 spades (with the club ruff in dummy) are all that is obvious.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: for Chambers  1N opening would be good 15-18|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: I admit that I probably would have ducked the heart, but Schwarts did better.  Now he has a chance.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|kit: He may take ruffing finesse in hearts now.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that hand has no rebid over 1nt, surely 1nt opening right no matter what|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems inconsistent to me -- if hand has extras, it is worth 1N if not, then shape says pass the non-forcing 1N|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: This looks bad for him, but he can recover by taking club finesse and ruffing a diamond in dummy -- thus taking 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Winning defense would be low diamond by West, but I don't see how he can realistically find that.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a tough defense, but his partner passed twice with K9xxxx of @H's, so he knows he doesn't have much|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could have ruffed with 7 of spades, of course, but playing for this exact layout is pretty double-dummy.|pg||
nt|warrens:  there are 16 HCP outstanding and declarer must have most of them|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: maybe they only pass with 5332 min|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|kit: On a diamond play, declarer can still survive by winning queen, club finesse, discarding diamond, and ruffing high when necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: If defense can be that double-dummy, so can declarer.|pg||
nt|kit: Now it seems to me that he has no choice but to hope everything works -- spades 2-2, club hook on.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: only alternative is to play East for ace-doubleton of diamonds -- which is possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's either that or play East for Ax in @D's (since East has shown up with 2 @S's and 6@H's he's much more likely to be short)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll finesse, since it's a better % play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: but he might think that the reason West shifted to ace and a spade rather than a club is that West holds queen of clubs.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|swanson: I like Kit's philosophy about forcing bids - the're forcing unless you pass.  Just requires partnership understanding in the post-mortem sometimes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  85  [where Smith never bid]  Boyd overcalled Precision 1@D with 3@D    Feldman in 5@C south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Granovetter's guess ==  play 4@H rather than 3N|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Kit is a believer that asking for kings does not show all the keycards - that way he can get to some superior 6NT contracts (as in this case - sort-of).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John, do you know origin of the term 'kickback' ?|pg||
nt|swanson: I don't know the derivation of the name 'kickback'.  It is an extension of 'redwood'.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember reading about kickback before redwood - but brain gets fuzzy [again] after that|pg||
nt|ady: losing club will go on long diamond    fortunate lay|pg||
nt|larrymori: looks at first that a @c continuation was necessary but declarer can negotiate the @d position that the defense has to give|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: to my way of thinking, the big advantage of relay systems comes from blind opening leads, with declarers hand totally unknown|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the problem isn't here   other room is bidding 72|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: True. Other room behind by a bd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Schermer have a courtesy raise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at least partial credit for this swing goes to .... system|pg||
mb|p|nt|stew: 3Clubs got the job done|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Rubin  2@H/NT  just forcing noises|pg||
nt|ady: suggestions of 6@D by west   somewhat unlikely to be played from that side   and fortunate on a squeeze without a spade lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8+ BAL,  3@C=(41)44  3@D asks  3@H=1444|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=4315|pg||
nt|stew: perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: you found russ in the audience?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it would take me a year to learn this system and an instant to forget it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forget what?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i already forgot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the tough part -- envisioning hands that fit 4513 16-18 that still give play for slam  before just giving up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK instead of @HQ makes 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Axxx Kxx x AKQxx |pg||
nt|fabsayc: same example al came up with|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also room for both major Jacks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those wouldn't be great, but give slam a chance|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: nope  EW playing  GUS  Granovetter Unified System   [all info from very reliable source]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think about this policy of removing boards  [when usually no associated penalty]|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: general invite?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a direct quote  "4NT was, i think, DI Keycard; first step = no"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no what|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: no = not willing to show anything extra|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only a marginal game anyway, more to luck|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: best lead - but still 9 with @H finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently a slam invite, and 5@C said no interest|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: so 4N an Optional RKC   either reject or show KC  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems weird with 4 of their short suit available |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|swanson: Back in the old days some of the Italian pairs used a 'D-I' 4NT = declarative - interrogatory.|pg||
