nt|blewah: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|han: hi Arya|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|blewah: after finding double fit in minors they are on the way to slam, i think|pg||
nt|han: slam is almost 50% on this hand, but the finesse is off|pg||
nt|han: however, missing 2 keycards I'd expect them not to bid it|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hello all|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, we'll see how they check keycards now|pg||
nt|blewah: hi Tim|pg||
nt|han: not clear though which suit they play keycards for|pg||
mb|5C|nt|han: if clubs, they can't find that they are missing 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: Wortel can't cuebid|pg||
nt|han: Hoi Tim|pg||
nt|han: Difficult decision for West here|pg||
nt|blewah: kib points out that it is strange that N didn't compete with both majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hmm now west is close|pg||
nt|han: he's certainly missing the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|han: and maybe something in diamonds|pg||
nt|han: I think that east should do something different with AKQ of diamonds plus the club queen|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but east never showed any minimum|pg||
nt|blewah: i wonder what 3@h is|pg||
nt|han: a kibitzer suggests that 5C is last train|pg||
nt|han: that's not clear to me though|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: I think 5C is a possible contract|pg||
nt|han: she doesn't know that west has 5 diamonds, he could have only 3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|han: then I'd rather play in  the 5-4 club fit rather than the 5-3 diamond fit|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  nice decision by Pepsi|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  3@C is forced|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  you should write an article about the hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: I used dealmaster pro, kibitzers are asking|pg||

nt|han: I would prefer 1H with the east hand instead of 3D|pg||
nt|han: but I've noticed that wortel doesn't often respond at the 1-level on bad hands|pg||
nt|han: what do you like with this hand?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|han: maybe it depends on whether you can get out in 3D when partner rebids 2NT|pg||

mc|8|nt|timverbeek:  Im very used to bid my 4cards|pg||
nt|blewah: 3@d in their agreement must be so weak that the 18-19 opener cannot rebid 3nt i think|pg||
nt|han: I'm hearing from a kibitzer who did a more thorough double dummy investigation for Wortel's lead against 3NT|pg||
nt|han: on board 23|pg||
nt|han: where she led the winning diamond|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I dont think they have such hard agreements|pg||
nt|han: he also found that the spade queen is best|pg||
nt|han: 39 wins for the spade queen, 25 for the diamond jack|pg||
nt|han: that's quite a margin, and although double dummy simulations should always be regarded with a grain of salt, I'd say that the spade queen is a serious option at least|pg||
nt|han: that's the hand where the other table led the heart 10, which gets less love from the double dummy simulations, and also from the actual layout|pg||
nt|blewah: that's intuitive too, don't you think?|pg||
nt|han: I don't know, hard to say|pg||

pc|s6|nt|timverbeek:  see that if north wouldnt open 3@H, cause of the 4@S, they wouldnt score a nice 200 on this board|pg||
nt|han: another question is whether south should double 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|han: maybe it depends on how solid your 3H openings are|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|han: another hand with 7 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: new leader again|pg||
nt|han: but better spades and worse hearts|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  always hard to interpret how good your hand is|pg||
nt|blewah: you guys speak too loudly :)|pg||
nt|han: partner does not have a particularly good hand, with only 2 hearts and lots of values in the minors|pg||
nt|han: still 4H seems to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|han: of course the spade king and the heart ace are well placed|pg||
nt|han: other table now playing hand 26|pg||
nt|han: where Wortel opened 2D|pg||
nt|han: they opened 1D, which should (hopefully for Milner) lead to 4H making|pg||
nt|han: Wortel has losing options here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|han: such as letting the spade run to her 9 (doesn't work) and then take the club finesse (doesn't work)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|han: but now she doesn't really have an entry for the club finesse so she'll make it I think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  well still  to guess now|pg||
nt|han: yes|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  if hearts are 2-2 or 3-1|pg||
nt|han: should she play for hearts 2-2 or the club finesse?|pg||
nt|han: if the hearts are 3-1, they might return a spade|pg||
nt|han: in that case she can still finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  well done Meike|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|blewah: directly, I mean|pg||
