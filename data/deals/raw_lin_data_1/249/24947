nt|kit: North can visualize a possible game, but on balance passing seems to me to be percentage.|pg||
nt|cumino: 2@C for protecting 4@H of partner or pass?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: looks like a normal 1NT (unless north all of a sudden employs stayman and then retreats to 3 cl)|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he has no way of even trying to duplicate results because fantoni system so different|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: He shouldn't try to duplicate -- just play best bridge, regardless of match score|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think 2 d followed by 2 sp was a balanced invite with 4 hearts.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I believe this is a balance game try and promises 4 @H's.  Can anyone confirm|pg||
nt|warrens:  balanced*|pg||
nt|kit: So this gets them dangerously high, but it looks like there will be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  That's been confirmed|pg||
nt|cumino: They could beat |pg||
nt|ehsana: Danger zone but manageable|pg||
nt|kit: I think it takes an impossible heart lead to create problems -- knocking entry off dummy prematurely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond queen lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: Even on diamond lead, I think declarer would be okay|pg||
nt|warrens:  right, K and a @H ducked would be perfect :)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

nt|cumino: Or he counted too much on the opponents. Helgemo had the same lead and unblcked quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is worse than complex|pg||

nt|fluff:  played @D to Ace|pg||

nt|queequeg: Fulvio Fantoni official website, containing also his personal impressions about these Championships: www.fulviofantoni.com|pg||
nt|warrens:  this slam could easily swing the match.  Monaco has bid the right contract but is likely to lose 12 imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: on the normal spade lead the best odds seems to be to cash heart ace enter d with club ruff and then run a d. (if it loses then there are enough entries to ruff out the 5 th heart. ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: (The only flaw in that plan is that it doesn,t work). |pg||
nt|ehsana: bidding 6D was easy|pg||
nt|kit: how is that better than immediate diamond finesse?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbennet: it isn,t. |pg||
nt|bt: monaco been on the right side of 2 50/50 slams so they deserve not to make this one|pg||
nt|warrens:  even if they go down, 16 imps is not that many with 10 boards left|pg||
nt|ehsana: poor sweden dont desrve 6D make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible to play ace of diamonds first, since entries would be better to set up the hearts|pg||
nt|bt: i didnt evaluate the odds on this one, just said they made 2 other 50/50s|pg||
nt|cumino: Or he plays @H 43 + K@D stif or the finesse|pg||
nt|jbennet: spade lead removes a vital entry prematurely. if declare palys d ace and no king shows up, then hearts can no longer be set up.|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, after losing diamond finesse and spade back, I think an entry short to set up hearts|pg||
nt|cumino: KDx is poor|pg||
nt|kit: the play to set up hearts would be heart to ace and low diamond -- playing ace first (with no king dropping) would still leave him an entry short.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so basically the slam all depends on playing the trump suit for no losers. |pg||
nt|warrens:  with S known to be 45 or longer, @H's being 43 isn't all that likely.  certainly less than usual.|pg||
nt|cumino: To me 1 down|pg||
nt|bt: what about 30 diamonds?|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, it would appear that diamond finesse percentage play, but we shall see.|pg||
nt|ehsana: AT times TOP players defy logic :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm told 2@S promised at least 6@C's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what about inferences about diamond king from the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see any inference about diamond king -- he would make that bid regardless of his diamond holding with right stuff in black suits.|pg||
nt|ehsana: I alrdy said 2S bid should induce finesse|pg||
nt|cumino: Well I really think that an explanation is 45 but all think is 46 (IMHO)|pg||

nt|warrens:  North can afford to split his @H each time, since declarer only has 3 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Only real hope is club finesse or something unexpected in hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's given up already on the @C finesse, since he needs two ruffs in dummy.  so now he needs Kx with North|pg||
nt|ehsana: Club Finesse..will makeit minus 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  not possible|pg||

nt|fabsayc: either king is good lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|cumino: May be K was not so wrong (not because it worked)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: That gets declarer up to 8 tricks, and when there is 8 ......|pg||
nt|kit: However, there are problems -- the ace of spades may get isolated.|pg||
nt|kit: But defense will have difficulty getting out of their own way.|pg||
nt|kit: He has to set up diamonds now before ace of hearts entry knocked out|pg||
nt|cumino: Knowin Fulvio I could prepare a coffee easily, then drink, smoke a sigaretet. I shoruldn't lose many tricks :)|pg||
nt|ehsana: logistics poor...but 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|jbennet: if declarer loses d to south then south sets up spade trick, and there will be  time for defence to set up 5 tricks (1+1+1+2)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|sK|nt|moshel: great deff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: So correct, he did need to duck the diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbennet: spade back now and north have 2 entries left (1 to push a heart through). |pg||
nt|kit: defense has 5 winners -- 2 clubs, 1 in every other suit|pg||
nt|ehsana: I always go with the right person and Kit is right :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|tokay1975: he comes with his family|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S contract in other room quite reasonable, but ran into an unlucky lie of the cards|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bt: 4@S is eminently makeable, but maybe thats double dummy|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: South was pretty much running from 2@H, but now he will be interested|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|bt: the @S8 is huge here|pg||
nt|kit: Double pretty clear -- partner opened 1NT, opponents have only 8 spades, he has both red suits under some control.|pg||
nt|bt: west maybe short in spades|pg||
nt|cumino: May be a bit coming from the previous, this double |pg||
nt|fabsayc: has to have 2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: West did open 1NT|pg||
nt|bt: yea 1nt in their style|pg||
nt|bt: anyway declarer can get 5@S 1@H 3@D and a club ruff with the 8|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer pretty much knows the entire distribution after this opening lead|pg||
nt|kit: But I don't think that will help him.|pg||
nt|bt: well going up ace he should make|pg||
nt|bt: ducking makes it interesting|pg||
nt|kit: East also knows the distribution|pg||
nt|ehsana: Dmnd duck must|pg||
nt|kit: why does going up ace let it make (although surely he won't go up ace)|pg||
nt|bt: declarer needs @SJ doubleton doesnt he?|pg||
nt|kit: I still don't see where 10 tricks come from|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|bt: declarer can give up a club, ruff a club with the @S8, pull 2 trumps ending in dummy, then 4 red tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 spades,3 diamonds and a heart|pg||
nt|kit: Well, now can make by drawing 2 rounds of trumps and playing king of clubs|pg||
nt|ehsana: cards favourale fro that line of play|pg||
nt|jbennet: isnt west huge favourite to have 22 in spades diamonds from declarers point of view?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, he is|pg||
nt|kit: East knew that for sure -- I think he should have ducked diamond|pg||
nt|bt: yea 2425 and then Jx of spades, like someone said|pg||
nt|bt: 2524 i guess also, then no @SJ necessary|pg||
nt|bt: so win in dummy and play a club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|jillan:  overtake the @D and lead @C? But then need to ruff the @C with the @S8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jillan:  seems likely at the table|pg||
nt|bt: it is easy for us seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|bt: never forget that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there another layout that works, i cant see one|pg||
nt|mikael_w: It is not enough to ruff with the @s 8|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there are still some things you must do right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mikael_w: he must reach the tricks to|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 10 easy tricks but it is far from obvious. what if west had returned a small club?? declarers would be very concerned about spade jack.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jillan:  was not easy for West, but this should be helpful for declarer|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: if small club return, can just discard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: disagree, this gives him losing line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only 8 tricks certain on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 9|pg||
nt|ehsana: think eclarer has worked out well teh distribution|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table west lead @D T and east ducked|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if he ruffs a @s now and take the @s A he will make it as everybody can see. but what IF W has 3 @s:s|pg||
nt|phil: then how can he make anyway? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: exactly now has losing lines|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so there is still options how to play as I see it|pg||
nt|kit: point is that East wouldn't have much of a double with only a doubleton spade -- if declarer draws that inference.|pg||
nt|jillan:  now a @S to the ace and run @D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club split he can make|pg||
nt|cumino: Now I don't see what he is thinking. Or makes or 1 down, playing spades|pg||
nt|kit: declarer knows clubs aren't splitting|pg||
nt|psyck: We have a record number of kibitzers at a table here|pg||
nt|psyck: earlier was short of 7000|pg||
nt|cumino: spade ace normal|pg||
nt|petka:  spade to ace is superior in case east has Jx spades left. He can cash his red tricks and at worst -1|pg||
nt|jbennet: if now souths concludes 22 spade-daimaond with west then: Cash high spade, ruff club high and cash 3 red tricks for 590|pg||
nt|petka:  ruffing first loses to spade jack in E hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|kit: he may be on losing line now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petka:  *whew*|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bt: now it is automatic :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  still not home|pg||
nt|kit: Although even if he plays a diamond here he is okay|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Well, W can still have J5 of @s right ?|pg||
nt|jillan:  i do not count the chickens until they are all in|pg||
nt|kit: So really can't go wrong unless he plays ace of hearts, heart ruff, club ruff|pg||
nt|bt: but then there is no make is there|pg||
nt|kit: oh right -- East gets to pitch diamonds -- so must play ace of spades|pg||
nt|petka:  maybe Peter knows it all and is just trying for overtricks?|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should get it right though -- any other line looks like a concession.|pg||
nt|petka:  :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But the @h can be 5-3 and 3 @s from start with W|pg||
nt|andersk: Many specs ask regarding time...those of you that has been here all the time....is both pair slow or is it case for a director desision?|pg||
nt|jillan:  only one word : Fantoni|pg||
nt|fabsayc: both pairs slower than slow|pg||
nt|phil: the other table played very quickly|pg||
nt|kit: hard to believe -- they are finished in other room, and have half the boards left here.  Must have been easier hands there.|pg||
nt|jbennet: east is favourite to hold 3 spades, since it would a huge gamble to x 4 sp with only doubleton spade and only an ace. |pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: in the other room also start 15minutes later...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, anyway I think he will end up playing the right way now and play @s to A|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: GF, so 10+ in their system|pg||

nt|mikael_w: hole @c-suit ?|pg||
nt|andersk: I totally agree with you, Kit..|pg||
nt|phil: you'd have to need a good reason that it would disrupt communications, although you should have some idea a trump lead will work because of an expected layout too|pg||
nt|kit: of course if North doubles 5@C, then will get club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|bt: hungary defeatted sweden in seniors with 17, getting 16 here after defeating 6@D and making it in the other room|pg||

nt|cicus: N had the opportunity to butt in a 2@C overcall|pg||

nt|bt: the way to get back in the match|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe 4@d should be @h fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: this could be a big number for E-W if they start doubling|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@s = @h + @c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: thanks to all congratts. I have now got 1523 of them, so my fingers will bleed if I shod thank each and everyone of you, so THANKS all|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: yes, always @cs|pg||
nt|jillan:  I agree with that :) can't even follow what you all are saying|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: S can bid 2NT Lebensohl now|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised Fantoni didn't double 2@S, although maybe that means spade support.|pg||
nt|phil: I think he's planning on a making a penalty double in something after the strong 1@s opening|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this your average swedish micaels|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now its 2736 congratts, but OK THEN let them come !!! :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@s opening is 14+ with 5+@s or 11-13 with 5+@s - 4@h|pg||
nt|kit: Same 2@S call in other room and East did double, but West never gave his partner a chance.|pg||
nt|phil: I'm happy for Sweden, but commentators should make an attempt to 'curb their enthusiasm'....:)|pg||
nt|bt: east has a hefty penalty double opposite that, nice lie for declarer though|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3D|nt|uni_dennis: 2NT = Lebensohl |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mikael_w: I am glad I had my computer on service today :) Otherwise my computer would not make this I think. I must have some kind of record in messages in 5 min I think. But today we are ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: @h+@c i meant. 2N was leb to signoff|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: Russia won in 2004|pg||
nt|bt: i have to leave, fingers crossed for a swedish victory today, bye all|pg||
nt|mikael_w: THIS was the board I was afraid of before when I diddnt wanted to selebrate to early. easy to have a BIG payouy on N/S on this board|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the Women's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Payout|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: women's final will be Russia-England|pg||
nt|phil: I don't think 3@h x'd was going for a lot|pg||
nt|kit: true -- club spots helpful|pg||
nt|phil: a forcing defense might get it 2, West's @h9 is pesky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even if the score was 220-220 now would EW not get some time penalties?|pg||
nt|phil: been told Balicki made 8 tricks in hearts in the other match|pg||
nt|kit: also, which suit will they play?|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cumino: Cullin had bo reason to bid 3@H vulnerable normally. After 7@H 1 down just cashed......|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|phil: I think many would just overcall 2@h|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: I disagree strongly with 2@h|pg||
nt|phil: but its a good idea to show partner 10 cards instead of 5/6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope i am objective but i quess Fantoni himself did use some 50% of all thinking time|pg||
nt|psyck: especially when they can show specific two suiters unlike michaels|pg||
nt|kit: Whatever the right bid on North hand is, I don't think state of match is at all relevant.  You still have to play bridge.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|uni_dennis: if 2@s shows @h+@c i always bid it with this hand, bad luck partner has no fit at all, but i showed both if we have some fit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|nt|mikael_w: I dont think its a matter of right or wrong what to bid on N hand, its more a matter of style to play|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and that could mean the right decision if bidding goes high quickly|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|phil: you cannot turn a deaf ear to the colors either|pg||
nt|kit: That is true -- vulnerable games still pay that big bonus.|pg||
nt|cumino: If 2NT is weak, there is no reason to bid 3@H on 3@D, no one. |pg||
nt|mikael_w: in this vuln me and my partner normaly has better cards to bid an overbid. But I have seen partners that has alot worse cards and bid overbids and always lands on their feets ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: anyway soo...|pg||
