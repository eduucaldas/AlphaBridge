nt|ahollan1: Buras-Narkiewicz play Strefa  [NOT Polish Club]|pg||
nt|petergill: Typical good BBO service|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: transfer responses don't really need points  --  but apparently there IS a limit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: balancing NT would be 10-15|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Most experts respond on those South cards nowadays, to try to make it harder for the opponents to reach 3NT/game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  leads 3rd/low    carding  udca|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|petergill: respond light - especially when NS are not vul|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of board that Swedish supprters will welcome|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Club  lead might trouble 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Balicki-Zmudzinski play Polish Club  so 2@C = Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK led at other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously  least damging lead is the singleton|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|petergill: 7 tricks - entries and timing make setting up @d and/or @h tricky|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as usual I miscount tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Tempting to play on @h and go down|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead is best|pg||
nt|petergill: @D now - will most likely make|pg||
nt|petergill: @H now = almost certain to fail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better resist heart temptation|pg||
nt|petergill: @S!0 lead is not quite as good as @C lead - on @s lead, with no easy entries to dummy, declarer would probably win @S10 and lead low @HJ, endplaying N|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: @S lead initially looks better at Trick 1 but just delays North's problems |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so very likely Cullin unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with more HCP  Bertheau probably responds|pg||
nt|jillan:  hi all :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: playing South for heart q or king rather than diamond jack |pg||
nt|petergill: @D10 play at Trick 2 might even get covered by J from Jx or Jxx - or perhaps not in a World Championship Grand Final?|pg||
nt|petergill: But @HQ8xx(x) in South means it's not as simple as Victor says |pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Jill, Victor|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: combination of !AH and @SJ seems to translate to making now|pg||

nt|Vugraphzay: and I have to work with a very tiny laptop with Italian keyboard ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: still waiting for Wests discardù|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: discard|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA play then @D switch then @h exit to dummy - locks declarer in dummy to beat 3NT - but @SA is useless play if North has @DA, hence the spade duck was better, looking at 26 cards|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: I still have no idea if this will make or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Buras choices not easy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzay: actually @C2 is discarded on this trick but VG operator must have missed previous discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: and at some point just entered something ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this hand is tough to defend looking at 52 cards, but impossibly tougher to defend looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|jillan:  Thanks Mark |pg||
pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another problem with East's defense -- Buras doesn't know @C distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: the defence doesn't know if declarer will cash @CA or not, and doesn't know if their aim is to lock declarer in dummy or in the North hand|pg||

nt|serhat: small one!:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes modify their structure when leading partner's suit|pg||
nt|petergill: N thought that 4@S directly over 1@C was inappropriate, likely to lose more than it gains, becasue he seemed to have good defence and not such robust spade texture |pg||
nt|jillan:  YOU LEAD WITH THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT HAND|pg||
nt|jillan:  sorry fo the screaming :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   smile = doubleton  frown = singleton   [reverse facial expressions]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but those don't work with screens|pg||
nt|petergill: also, he was a bit strong for direct 4@S at this vulnerability, which might give NS problems at the five level, e.g. not doubling if EW save |pg||

nt|serhat: 300 sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzay: TD at the table, declarer thinking about options|pg||
nt|petergill: West thought that with 7 @H's, E would bid 4@H directly over 3@S, hence W played N for 3 @h's and thus was stopping @h ruff in dummy, compared to @HK play which is what he would do ...|pg||
nt|petergill: if he could see all 52 cards, as we can|pg||

nt|petergill: With @C9 as a penalty card, W could not take @DA on first round of @D, or else a club lead would be insisted upon by N|pg||
nt|serhat: again famous singleton theory disaster: if you do not lead it you do not have one!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Canada leads Milner by 31|pg||
nt|cumino: East complicated the bid. After pass on 1@C 1@S he could bid 3@H. Since he didn't open 3@H or 2@D he would have showed his hand. |pg||
nt|jillan:  there was a penalty card?|pg||
