nt|han: which seemed a very tricky contract|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|han: especially since it was played from the east and south led a club|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|han: It' certainly possible that Canada will start with a big swing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: On this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: North checked if partner had 3-card spade support by bidding 2D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|han: although 2D was not alerted, I assume that it did not show diamonds|pg||
nt|han: with this club split, 3NT will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|han: the hearts can be brought in for 3 tricks though|pg||
nt|han: once the heart 10 drops|pg||
nt|han: it is best to finesse on the third round|pg||
nt|han: this would win against 10x and 9x|pg||
nt|han: but lose against 109x|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|han: on this hand everything behaves nicely though|pg||
nt|shevek: friendly layout here to make 12 tricks in 4@s|pg||

nt|han: you have no choice but to play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|han: pitching a club|pg||
nt|han: when the hearts survive|pg||
nt|han: you play a spade towards the king|pg||
pc|d4|nt|han: declarer could let the diamond run to his queen|pg||
nt|han: but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|han: it may be safer to win the ace|pg||
nt|han: and play trumps|pg||
nt|han: the opponents can then take the diamond trick|pg||
nt|han: but you are in control to pitch a club on the hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: safe to play the 7|pg||
nt|han: imagine that you play a low diamond and west has the king|pg||
nt|han: now they can switch to clubs|pg||
nt|han: now if hearts split 5-1|pg||
nt|han: you could lose a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|han: so it seems a little safer to win the ace of diamonds|pg||

nt|han: Here it worked out fine|pg||
nt|han: 2S went down 2 but NS could make something in clubs|pg||
nt|han: so it is likely a push or a small win|pg||
mb|2H|nt|han: maybe 130 in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|han: East has 7 hearts so usually you would open 3H with that|pg||
nt|han: but here east is red against white|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|han: so they decided to bid one lower|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: Jacek would have preferred to jump to 3S over 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|han: he has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|han: but after 3C he has no choice|pg||
nt|han: he is certainly too strong for a simple 3S bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|han: unfortunately for him, his partner only brings one big useful card, the queen of spades|pg||
nt|shevek: good board for NS|pg||
nt|han: of course the jack of diamonds is also welcome|pg||
pc|h4|nt|han: but the opponents can take 4 tricks of the top and it seems impossible for them not to take those tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|han: and probably a diamond ruff or 2|pg||
nt|han: so -100 or -150 is quite likely|pg||

nt|han: whether to give his partner a heart ruff|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|han: the spade 9 is important here|pg||
nt|han: south will cash the spade king and then the ace|pg||
nt|han: when west shows out|pg||
nt|han: south knows to finesse through east|pg||
nt|han: then she can pitch a club on the hearts and make 170|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|han: however, if the defense started with a diamond and 3 rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|han: south would have to ruff the third club in dummy|pg||
nt|han: then, there are only 2 spades left in dummy|pg||
nt|han: so you cannot play the spades as here|pg||

pc|d9|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: why not?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|han: you'd have to guess whether that's a singleton, a doubleton, or even a falsecard from J10x!|pg||
nt|han: if you had no other information, you would play the spades from the top|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2@D followed by 2@S is the way to show both|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|han: after the redouble, when 3D came back to south|pg||

nt|han: I am not sure that it is right to do so|pg||
nt|han: with an 11-count and west having doubled twice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if they are sitting like yesterday, nick is west, judith east|pg||

pc|h4|nt|han: South has a GF hand for spades|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|han: she could jump to 4S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|han: but if partner is strong, you might have slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not matter as andy said|pg||
nt|han: and then it is useful to that you have 3-card support and not 4-card support |pg||
nt|han: some pairs do not play support doubles after showing 5 spades, others do|pg||
nt|han: I like still playing support doubles here, the fourth trump is still really big|pg||
nt|shevek: in bd 6 EW reached 6@c|pg||
nt|han: for example, if the opponents bid 3H|pg||
nt|han: it is nice for partner to know that you have a 9-card fit, or an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|han: it is even more important when the opponents jump to 4H|pg||
nt|han: now north will often be thinking about bidding 4S over 4H|pg||
nt|han: and it is very useful to know how many spades partner has|pg||
nt|han: but admittedly, it is different from when partner has shown 4+, because then the main issue is whether you have a fit or not|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|han: at the other table|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: which finesses should north take|pg||
nt|han: EW are playing 6C on hand 6|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|han: which won't make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|han: but they were in 5H|pg||
nt|han: which would have made|pg||
nt|han: so it will be more IMPs to Canada, instead of IMPs to Milner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this defense looks wrong to me|pg||
nt|han: North is now at the stage where he can't go wrong|pg||
nt|han: because the diamond king is now singleton onside|pg||
nt|han: but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|han: and he is in a difficult situation|pg||
nt|han: he doesn't want to pull trump and then play diamonds|pg||
nt|han: because when it loses, the opponents may take a heart or two|pg||
nt|han: but if he doesn't pull all the trumps and finesses in diamonds|pg||
nt|han: the opponents may take a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|han: so either way he is in danger if the diamond finesse is off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Q109 leads 10|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|han: and he is deciding which line is more risky|pg||
nt|han: I think he will finesse diamonds now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the point is nick knows there is no losing diamond play|pg||
nt|han: even when it is off|pg||
nt|han: he'll make if east has a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|han: which seems likely|pg||
nt|han: if east had a doubleton trump, I meant to write|pg||

nt|han: I think that north should have taken the heart ace at trick 2|pg||

nt|han: but I'm not nearly as good as this North, so perhaps I'm missing something|pg||
nt|han: yes Hedy, I mean the first heart trick|pg||
nt|han: trick 2 counting from the start of the hand :)|pg||
nt|han: ducking the heart gave away the contract against perfect defense|pg||
nt|han: it doesn't seem impossible for west to find this defense even|pg||
nt|han: even after taking the spade ace at trick 1|pg||
nt|han: the defense could beat the contract by switching to a diamond at trick 2|pg||
nt|han: declarer has to duck (otherwise 3 diamond tricks) and then the defense can play hearts|pg||
nt|han: that's a defense usually found in books tough|pg||
nt|han: though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: your right in theory han, and there was a clue that east had only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|han: well, I would think that east can signal there too|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|han: east played the heart 9|pg||
mb|2C|nt|han: would they play the heartt 9 with four of them?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|han: so there is some potential for Milner on that hand, I must admit that I'm happy to see that|pg||
nt|han: 3H is weak|pg||

nt|han: even if you don't play weak jumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10/9 =0/2|pg||
mb|4C|nt|han: so, I misread the auction|pg||
nt|han: Wortel has a huge hand|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|han: but what should she do|pg||
nt|han: bid diamonds, support hearts, or double 4C?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|han: Hedy, I would definitely expect 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|han: with only 4, there is little reason to introduce them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: North has diamond support, but he can also see that the heart suit is pretty much useless in a diamond contract|pg||
nt|han: so he repeats the hearts|pg||

nt|han: I hear that Sweden is up 128 IMPs in the open final|pg||
nt|han: so there is a good chance that Poland will surrender|pg||
nt|han: and this will be the only match this afternoon|pg||
nt|han: one kibitzer is asking me about the long pause of declarer on the previous hand|pg||
nt|han: when he played the diamond king|pg||
nt|han: it seems like a dirty trick|pg||
nt|han: but it could easily be a pause by the vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|han: you would have to be at the table to know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is hard for us to know the real tempo|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|han: a diamond lead would doom the contract immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i disagree with this lead strongly|pg||
nt|han: now declarer has enough tricks|pg||
nt|han: yes, with south showing hearts and north showing spades|pg||
nt|han: there is a lot to be said for a diamond lead|pg||
nt|han: north could have bid 3C puppet stayman I believe|pg||
nt|han: then the 4-card heart suit by south would be hidden|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: diamond queen if not conventional to start unblocking|pg||
nt|han: 1NT - 3C - 3D = no five card major, may or may not have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|han: then 3H by north = I have 4 spades|pg||
nt|han: and south bids 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|han: easy had several opportunities to bid diamons|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|han: diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|han: this hand is over|pg||
nt|han: and a potential swing in favor of Milner|pg||
nt|han: if east opens a weak 2D opening|pg||
nt|han: NS might end in 3NT from the north side|pg||
nt|shevek: these days many would open 3@d with easts hand (nv)|pg||
nt|han: declarer has 4 clubs, 2 hearts, 2 (actually 3) spades and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|han: that's 9 (10)|pg||
nt|han: so all declarer has to think about is how to play the clubs|pg||
nt|han: she can guard against clubs 4-1 on both sides|pg||
nt|han: so who should she play to have club length?|pg||
nt|han: I think east|pg||
nt|han: since west led from what seems to be a bunch of small spades, a suit bid by north|pg||
nt|han: bid meaning shown here :)|pg||
nt|han: so west is less likely to have a 4-card club suit|pg||
nt|han: another possibility is to cash the spades and the hearts first|pg||
nt|han: when she sees the hearts split 5-1|pg||
nt|han: she will play club ace and king|pg||
nt|han: so that she can finesse through east|pg||
nt|han: a last option|pg||
nt|han: is to play east for the spade jack|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|han: would west really lead the spade 6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|han: when he or she had the jack?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 is from nothing in spades|pg||

pc|dT|pg||

nt|han: you could start with 2D|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|han: you have to start with double|pg||

mb|p|nt|han: Thanks for all the great voice comments Hedy and Andy!|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|han: this last hand is still interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|han: 3NT is far from cold with both finesses offside|pg||
nt|han: on a heart lead you have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|han: but on a spade lead, you have some work to do|pg||
nt|han: but I would expect a heart lead|pg||
nt|han: Wortel was probably forced to bid 3S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|han: Maybe 3NT would show clubs, or something else|pg||
nt|han: this hand also shows the danger of such a convention, besides the possibility of forgetting it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|han: if (on a different layout) west was able to double 3S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|han: that could be costly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|han: yes, perhaps a direct 3NT shows 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|han: If you play old fashioned puppet stayman|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dT|nt|han: then you can't handle that hand by starting with 3C|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h3|nt|han: there are many "fixes" for this problem, there is enough room after 3C|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|han: but for a first time partnership, they probably went with the easiest solution|pg||
nt|han: which is that 2NT - 3NT shows 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too many fixes, since i dont want to spend an hour discussing it, rather play ordinary stayman|pg||
nt|han: one fix, which I learned from Meike Wortel but probably comes from Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|han: is for 2NT - 3C - 3H to show 4+ hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|nt|han: after which you can ask for heart length by bidding 3S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|han: then after 2NT - 3C - 3D, you can ask for spade length by bidding 3H|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|c8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|han: then 3S shows 3, 3NT shows 2, and 4C shows 4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|han: that way you don't need this 2NT - 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|han: is to play that 2NT - 3C - 3H denies a 4-card major|pg||
