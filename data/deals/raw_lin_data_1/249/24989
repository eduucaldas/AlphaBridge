nt|pauleger: they play 4card suit openings, I should know their system very well |pg||
nt|pauleger: opening always the highest 4c suit except with 4@h/4@s --> 1@h|pg||
nt|pauleger: and their NT is 11-14|pg||
nt|svenja17: and their carding is standard, whilst most Germans play UDCA...|pg||
nt|pauleger: 7@sX parcontract? |pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played by north is makable|pg||
nt|desert: Nunn was second in the Transnationals last year.....so we can expect something from this pair....|pg||
nt|pauleger: we see boards 1-4 again, because we are broadcasting 2 rounds from another table|pg||
nt|pauleger: That is because the other table would have 2 bye rounds|pg||
nt|svenja17: we have had this deal last round...|pg||
nt|pauleger: due to an exit of one pair yesterday|pg||
nt|desert: looks like EW have to find the save in 6@S against 6 @H.....|pg||
nt|pauleger: :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT by N|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|desert: Boldt Weyand obviously did|pg||
nt|svenja17: N 6NT if clubs get mentioned, E-W 7@s if 6NT is found|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S!|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|desert: Then NS must find the 6N contract from the N seat......|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|svenja17: hmmm|pg||
nt|desert: And even then 7 @S is only down 4......so there are a lot of difficult decisions for both sides.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: 2@S= 3contrals no stop in @Ss|pg||
nt|desert: ups.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: controls|pg||
nt|svenja17: get out, Tony!|pg||
nt|pauleger: the 1@c opening didn´t really help|pg||
mb|5S|nt|svenja17: things really speed up:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|svenja17: 4@d ,,, a splinter bid to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|svenja17: showing 4crd-supp in @h and at most a singleton in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|svenja17: Blue-@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: But it is nice to have the best broadcasting time for our Australian kibs, 9pm :)|pg||

nt|desert: this is nearly the best possible result for EW (apart from 7 @H 1 down ;-)) |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

mb|2H|nt|svenja17: std 1NT-opener here, for their methods...|pg||
nt|pauleger: For those who are asking: Standard agreement would be 4 in a minor is splinter, but there are partnerships, who don´t play any splinters, if the opponents have bid|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|pauleger: A normal method would be either to pass 1NT or to bid 2@c with his 5c@h|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|svenja17: now you know some partnerships who rebid their M on 5 cards after a 1NT-response, Paul:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|svenja17: who is it, Paul?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|d6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|pauleger: :) Due to the alert on 1@h N/S play canapé|pg||
nt|pauleger: which means 2@c would have been 4@hs and longer @c|pg||
nt|desert: Well how do you avoid playing a 5-1 fit if north is 31(54) for example.......i think you cant...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pauleger: I can´t give you names, but I´ve heard of this method|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|pauleger: It makes sense in a way, that if one opponent bids, you need to find double fits more than shortnesses to have the opportunity to clarify your hand for a higher contestet auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pauleger: You can still splinter in the suit bid by the opponents, and that´s the most important shortness |pg||
nt|desert: lets see if EW can reach 5 Cl...not so easy |pg||
nt|desert: but now i think everything is fine|pg||
nt|pauleger: W shows some kind of 10 tricks :)|pg||
nt|desert: Excellent bid by Wilkinson|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|svenja17: the only fit in this hand is @c - e-w|pg||

nt|svenja17: you don't smoke Anna, do you?|pg||

nt|desert: when for example meckwell do it it cant be so bad.....;-)|pg||

nt|pauleger: 1NT - 3@c as puppet stayman is a common method for responding|pg||

nt|svenja17: do yoou like puppet, Paul?|pg||

nt|pauleger: your hand|pg||
nt|svenja17: Waltraud and Loek play Acol, 12-14. Or did they convert to 5card-M?|pg||
