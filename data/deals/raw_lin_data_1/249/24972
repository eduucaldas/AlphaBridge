nt|dburn: this shape entirely possible if the latter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf:  hmm i would want to open 1@d regardless on the east hand|pg||
nt|dburn: if you played a strong no trump, you might open a strong no trump|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|dburn: 1@d hearts, not sure why she is starting this way|pg||
nt|dburn: double = strong no trump with no spade stop or some other good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  hmm west wont be tempted to float this will she!?|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table North opened the bidding, and the auction was brief thereafter|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: here, West has got herself in something of a mess, but if she'd bid (or shown) spades first, she'd have got in a worse one|pg||
nt|roswolf:  en garde|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 1@s doesn't seem to have too many chances, so what Stockdale did may have worked very well|pg||

pc|dK|nt|roswolf:  since east is on lead - i think this will lead to another + score|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: might even go three down, if the defence is accurate - West can pitch clubs on diamonds, and the defence can more or less cross-ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: this is a real chance for Russia|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|dburn: who can make a lot of diamonds, while the English North-South never bid at all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: that's an improvement - Sweden led by 120 at one stage|pg||
nt|dburn: Gulevich might double this, but surely Khnonicheva won't sit for it|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|dburn: no, she bid on herself|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|roswolf:  n/s now have fielders choice|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if they choose to bid six diamonds they might not make it|pg||
nt|dburn: since East has good odds in leading the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf:  i think they would|pg||
mb|d|mb|5S|nt|roswolf:  well this limits the loss|pg||
