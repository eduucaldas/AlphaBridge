nt|barnets: if he brings this home|pg||
nt|granguru:  must play the @H7|pg||
nt|granguru:  as leader has not @HKQ10|pg||

nt|barnets: without tablet you need web version to hear voice|pg||
nt|kit: and the defense will have to play something|pg||
nt|barnets: bridgebaseonline.com|pg||
nt|kit: Might have been better for East to duck the 7 of hearts|pg||
nt|psyck: You can open multiple windows without login in the browser by going to http://www.bridgebase.com/, clicking on "Play Bridge Now"  and selecting the "Look around our site" button.|pg||

nt|jillan:  but still would probably have gone down on a @D lead and a spade retunr|pg||
