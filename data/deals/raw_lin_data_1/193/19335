nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes many would bid 3N, gives less away and NT a likely contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
pc|h5|nt|Gerben42:  Zimmermann will be surprised dummy has everything|pg||

nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||

nt|panja: the mistake of not playing high card in third seat...is not uncommon amongst novices...|pg||
nt|panja: that is why Third Hand Highest is an important rule...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a wydaje siê, ¿e zrzutka krakowska powinna byæ ceniona w kraju nad Wis³¹|pg||
nt|raghavan: score  has not changed|pg||
nt|runnerup: and it came so vulnerable game won -but can you avoid that lead --hard to say|pg||
nt|blum1956: a lively set ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer lucky trumps were 2-2 so he has an entry but even if East has 3 he would ruff the @c and be endplayed . Declarer would have to guess the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: after declarer draws only 2rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer is perhaps delighted, that this contract was still made|pg||
nt|eleni: so 1 more IMP for our Czech girls|pg||
nt|mancio89:  both poland and french declarer were not as good as she was|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: while there is an almost impossible defence to 3 clubs, in practice its a likely make|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S erxontai, mporei kai na vgoun|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|roussol: edo iparhei mans travihti|pg||
nt|andy_h: she* Gerben!|pg||

nt|panja: the @HT lead.....could be from KT9, QT9, T9 etc...absolutely no reason to duck...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 key cards missing, so no slam.|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S max her|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Press "Refresh" button|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  right|pg||
nt|panja: and now...if N passes, will E bid further?|pg||
nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||
nt|eleni: another misfit though|pg||
nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||
nt|panja: so bidding 2@D now..is the best option|pg||
nt|runnerup: a possible slam -down ofcause but ..|pg||
nt|runnerup: i would say only @h lead let it make|pg||
nt|rensph: 4@H for NS here|pg||

nt|eleni: I am not sure how Peter bids that 2@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes you're right but a @d lead looked most strange|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam in @c |pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes, 6@D on this placement can be made but tough to bid.|pg||
nt|mancio89:  and now it happens that sweden is just 7 Vps ahead|pg||
nt|frankbo: dbl antar jeg|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: hello everyone :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: and oddly Fisher only invites |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - two different hands, you see...|pg||
nt|poohbear: seems inconsistent|pg||

nt|eleni: His parents play that 2@c for both majors in such cases:) not sure about Peter though|pg||
nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||
nt|eleni: let us jope Megherita will keep the bidding low|pg||
nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||
nt|riccho:  N will be wondering now, where are the values for 3@s...|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky trump split for 1 off|pg||

nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||

nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: perhaps a club is ducked trick 2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||

nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||

nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||

nt|eleni: with a correct guess in @h there are 6 there|pg||
nt|chrisky: this is a nt contract|pg||
nt|chrisky: or pass|pg||
nt|roussol: or @d|pg||
nt|roussol: only contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: eg. KQ@h, still giving 1 trick away - change it to A@h and no losers, AND it's hcp less|pg||
nt|runnerup: kokish rele--means --balanced or @h natural ..|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer gives a trick back to the defense|pg||
nt|ady: around 4 tricks more than might have been made|pg||
nt|poohbear: slam now. |pg||
nt|poohbear: 7@h on guess for @d queen|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 makes with normal breaks|pg||
nt|eleni: We reminf you again the results site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=892&qroundno=9|pg||
nt|eleni: Plus the general site for our Young Bridge players. An excellent organization by EBF and the Bulgarian Federation!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max a partial for NS.|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 5 more boards and Italy needs 2 swings at least|pg||
nt|loe48: ja det er en spennende kamp..taales ikke mye slinger her foer en er ute og kjoerer|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: good morning Mama-Helena:) Same thing goes for you:) Giannakis might make correct guesses now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: On Bd 10 Netherlands picked up 13 IMPs - West bid 5@D after 3@H by N; in this room West Passed|pg||
nt|rensph: yes, perhaps N should've ducked but partner didn't go for a club ruff so singleton could seem unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|smirny: well with xxx in @S and stiff @D i think i would bid 4S too; IF  2@C have already been GF|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think the other table is going off in 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think sudden jump to 4@S denies control in @H and @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  just @S and @C, partner|pg||
nt|chrisky: ns make 2@D and ew 2@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: lets see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bagman: also with strip squeeze|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@h must take the @s after 2rounds @d and @s by W|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@h shows 4 card support and a weak hand|pg||
nt|poohbear: If Fisher bids 4@c and hears a 4@d Q bid he cn just bid slam|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see how he handles it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|riccho:  good bidding would have been: 1@s - 2@d - 3@c - 3@h (natural) - 4@d (trump suit) - 4@h (cue) - 4@s  (cue) - 4NT (RKCB) - 5@d (1kc = @sA) - 7@d |pg||
nt|frankbo: 5 ned i 3 rut|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: The Dutch boys in the Open reached the good 5@D contract on bd 10|pg||
nt|neobas: Looks like a solid 6@C here|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@C  if seeing all the cards   meantime 5@C best|pg||
mb|2S|nt|raghavan: well played for 6H|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt the most save one but 4 @s comes|pg||

mb|p|nt|neobas: Though the fit will have to be found at the four-level|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting.|pg||
nt|runnerup: guessing well here+ wellplaced cards lets 4 @h to be made |pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 heart is par contract|pg||

mb|3C|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
nt|vasmar: nice stop|pg||
nt|vasmar: on 22 HCP|pg||
nt|andreasw:  missed game med @d q i plads:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
nt|yusufb: celik 2nt demesi lazýmdý|pg||
nt|loe48: i aapent?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont see why Schwartz didnt Q bid|pg||
nt|yusufb: naturel degil|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: do u agree with the lead here Carl ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||
nt|roussol: 1@h is made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H for NS is making, but outbid in both rooms.|pg||
nt|eleni: now a @h lead to the weakness of the dummy would be great|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like another solid 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a @H|pg||
nt|bagman: in 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so par looks like 4 @s x-2|pg||
nt|galois85: Actually I don't understand the first pass of di franco, maybe scared by a 2@d of his partner?|pg||
nt|raghavan: clubs are in good position for 4 H |pg||

nt|galois85: would somebody bid dbl in E? (I do)|pg||

nt|chick: neither of you would open the North hand?|pg||

nt|bagman: E needs to keep the hearts and give up the clubs|pg||
nt|roussol: 2@d cannot be found so 2@s -1 doesn't seem a disaster|pg||
nt|runnerup: after @s lead rest is easy--without that lead you have to quess later and that is more difficult -start card is normally uder Q -not from ace|pg||

pc|d3|nt|riccho:  better to play @h on to shorten the dummy|pg||
nt|eleni: well, balance, with some values:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: on a @H lead he had to locate the @Dj|pg||
nt|rensph: I can understand pass but would open it myself|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: maybe a shade worse with north in the bidding?|pg||
nt|eleni: too many losers|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: I wud lead @H - dont like the @S lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or maybe he cud endplay East even on a @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit behaves as well|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W are in 1NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: yes he has done it |pg||
pc|s4|nt|famus: i think this was a forcing chk back--or nmf--dunno--if forcing then 3@ds shows 5 cards|pg||
nt|athene: south could have ducked that second spade too, so he has an entry to his fourth spade (declarer can't have four in hand as he didn't raise 1@S)|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||

nt|friggi: Sverige slaar tilbage:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: duplication in the spade suit here|pg||
nt|chick: 3N in the S can make on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a heart lead may scupper 3n|pg||
nt|chick: well, maybe not if he switches to a heart at the second chance|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
nt|loe48: den skal vel meldes ut eller?|pg||
nt|rensph: I like 2NT, rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||

mb|1N!|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yep, plenty of Zar points|pg||
nt|chick: 21 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@c|pg||
nt|andy_h: I've always wondered what 1NT-(2x)-4NT means. But of course if it's the minors it would be a bit premature on this strong of a hand so Zimmermann is trying to apply some science to ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: his 0-1-6-6 hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt, 4@S maybe|pg||
nt|runnerup: contract in wrong hand so can go down if @s switch come soon ..|pg||

nt|chick: 1@S makes, so long as partner doesn't get carried away and bid 2 :)|pg||
nt|rensph: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the spade sac is NS's best chance of a plus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with this is if you are going to bid 3N its better done quickly|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D, even 4, will be plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@S by N now may ask for @S hold?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes hasn showing extra values|pg||
nt|alati: gia sas|pg||
nt|eleni: Welcome Alec:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interesting choice; I would be more inclined to bid 2N unless that has some conventional meaning|pg||
nt|loe48: also here we may get a swingboard as it is fight to get the final call|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -2 down in practice now|pg||

nt|smirny: rumpelsohl?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  okay to play say some kibs - boring |pg||

nt|raghavan: now dropping DK alone matters - spade loser will go in Clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|loe48: and it is was a good call as we see the lay of cards are kind with this lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||

pc|s2|nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||

pc|s5|nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
