mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: this is the 4th match of the 8-team RR.  4 teams will be qualified to the finals.  These two teams are currently  4 and  5 in the ranking|pg||
nt|casenjo:  welcome to segment 4 out of 7; a 16 board set|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: precision type 2 @C |pg||
nt|casenjo:  starting with an 11-15 Precision 2@C auction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: most of the top Chinese woman players play Precision.  Both pairs here do.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  asked for a 4-card major, found their fit and bid their game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: WF Wang was the anchor player in winning the 2009 Venice Cup.  Her partner then, Liu, is now her teammates rather than partner.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|casenjo:  leading East's singleton would have beaten this contract|pg||
nt|casenjo:  let's see if west find a clubshift...........|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|gracelin: if the lead is 3/5th, West can see declarer also has a doubleton and there is no spade ruff avalable.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I like to lead singletons with control of the trump suit; but it has gotten the better of me when I know it is declarer's loong suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone.  West does know that partner has at most 1@C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West asks herself where are the 4 tricks for defenders, she may find the club shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW in closed room beat 3H with the singleton lead, so no prize here even if West fnds the C shift|pg||
nt|frankaus: just 10 imps on the line|pg||
nt|gracelin: It is important to fnish in the top 4 to go into the final.  Prizes are (appro) US$23K for winner, 15K for 2nd, 12K for 3rd and 9K for 4th. |pg||

nt|gracelin: as my friend Subhash pointed out, declarer needs 3 entry for the club hook and discard, she may not have that many entries for it.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|casenjo:  west needed 1083 and AQ97 in dummy|pg||
nt|gracelin: she needs 108x Vs. AQ97 to get the job done.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, 3 of @s is gone.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, a kibbitzer pointed out the error that she needed to save the small spade in dummy at trick 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more error is possible - N may well duck @c 10|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the longer she thinks, the more time she gives North to figure out her problem, this is were Zia and Meckstroth excel, they don't give you the time to figure out the declarer's problem|pg||
nt|gracelin: even if declarer has kept S3 in dumy, it cannot be used as a reentry to hand.  It is needed to ruff HK.|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but neither Zia nor Meckstroth would have used dummy's @S3|pg||
nt|casenjo:  then there is always the Rip Van Winkle coup|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, light on the N now?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  if you think too long, the opponents might go to sleep|pg||
nt|casenjo:  40 winks.....|pg||
nt|casenjo:  :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|gracelin: yes, C10 and duck by north is the only way to make this|pg||
