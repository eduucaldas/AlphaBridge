nt|othered1: In the right  hands, their standards for initial actions (look at non-space-consuminng direct overcalls opposite an unpassed  hand, too)  aren't bad, just way out of style.|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15   6+@C [1-suit]  OR   4@C & 5+@S |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D is Relay but does NOT promise any points|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly couldn't start playing the E/W system overnight. Must take years to discover all the wrinkles and possible problems.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 6NT by East is a decent contract in fact|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would be terrified of getting my long suit shut out, if I ever played a canape system.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it is fun when canape shuts out OPPONENT's suit|pg||
mb|4C|an|keycards|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C  i hope verhees knows it is forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only a club lead does not give away an immediate 12th trick, if East plays 6NT. On a club lead, declarer can take the diamond finesse or spend half an hour running the clubs. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: here comes Easley|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry i haven't studied system in a while     3@C was 6+@C that did NOT want to PASS   2N would have shown 6+@C with @S stop|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: i have a trusted side kick that lied to me|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: seems that 4@C asked for cue of 1st/2nd round controls|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: is this 3@h too big?|pg||
nt|joest: guess so|pg||
nt|swanson: A 3@C preempt with the South hand can cause serious problems for the opponents but creates havoc with consturctive bidding over your own preempts.  A partnership style.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit you would bid 3@h in your sleep, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW play fairly standard 5-card majors, strong notrump, short club - i am hunting for NS's convention card|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: Yes, I would|pg||
nt|joest: transfer then key cards?|pg||
nt|joest: then a mournful signoff in 5@s|pg||
nt|kit: seems normal -- basically what happened in other room, after 2@H opening and 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|sybarra: can Berk get back in iwth H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: with @H?|pg||
nt|joest: not over 4@h he can't|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, after 3@H opening might have been more interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: just need to rightside the slam|pg||
nt|ady: still only 11 sure tricks    |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Anyone know contract, declarer and number of tricks on board 2, so that I can give Bruce the code|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|kit: I'm surprised -- I thought they made 4-level transfer and then RKC|pg||
nt|kit: Pass over the double shows doubleton spade I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: inly a club lead from south does not immediately give the 12th|pg||
nt|athene: i think Versace can happily bid 3@C there to show his long club suit without implying loads of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: because with any strong hand he would start with a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: they are playing 5@s in the open|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs suggest almost certain to make|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though declarer is sure to succeed, even on a club lead, in 6nt, because both red suit finesses work|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: but there are ways to go down|pg||
nt|athene: you might play for a strip-and-throw-in on south, playing him for @HQ or @DK |pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|ady: best contract 6@C from east side   can ruff out the diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think Lauria intended that 4nt as blackwood|pg||
nt|roswolf: there could be an animated post-mortem on this one|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|athene: maybe he should simply have bid 6NT - not really possible for Versace to have no ace|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|swanson: I don't like a double here with the West cards.  You don't want to demand a heart lead, buying the contract is unlikely, and it gives help to the opponents in the auction and the ...|pg||
nt|swanson: play.|pg||
nt|ady: did not expect this swing|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: I agree John, but one hates to never bid with that hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: world class players having a bidding misunderstanding in a very simple sequence - there is hope for us mere mortals still|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|kit: The 4@D call is a splinter, and when Robinson showed no interest Boyd gave up on slam -- reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: After all, could have been off 3 aces on a bad day.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|athene: maybe he was still interested in a grand slam|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: of course, every pair must have its own rules about when 4NT is (or is not) blackwood, so it's hard to know who is to blame|pg||

nt|athene: versace might have felt that lauria had other ways to set clubs before bidding 4nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: a gift for schwartz|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 4@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: the feared Flannery|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2@H is Flannery|pg||
nt|timb: Reese intimated it was almost useless|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland bans us from commenting for using that word :) |pg||

nt|roswolf: an upgrade?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|timb: which one - Reese or useless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: flannery!|pg||
nt|ady: no problem to make 3NT for n/s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: This may steal the pot|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|timb: theorists would argue it's has too a low frequency to use for a 2-level bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php, or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Watch multiple tables (without logging in) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: I've played it often and I think it's primary benefit is on hands where it is not used|pg||
nt|joest: you can respond 1NT a lot more often over 1@h and not have to worry about responding 1@s on Jxxx or something like that|pg||
nt|athene: the EW convention card does say they play modified turbo rather than blackwood when clubs are trump|pg||
nt|athene: certainly 4nt blackwood is not so much use in clubs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Looks like both 2@S and 3@D are makes here, so possible pickup for Robinson|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead declarer will run round to ace|pg||
nt|athene: so turbo uses 4NT to say "i have an even number of keycards"|pg||
nt|ady: then obviously play on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what 4nt said - "i have slam interest in clubs and an even number of keycards" and versace was not at libterty to pass it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timb: like many conventions ;)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: minimum 9 tricks    likely more with west getting squeezed holding all the important cards|pg||
nt|athene: a guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: cashing the ace first would have resolved that|pg||
nt|ady: I would have tht ace first|pg||

nt|athene: declarer might not want to deal with a second heart from east, which is good news in diamonds|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|d6|nt|athene: as he will play the ace to guard against that|pg||

nt|kit: hmm -- something may have gone wrong -- East hand surely not worth 4@S if 3@S preemptive, and West hand surely not worth limit raise|pg||
nt|joest: ok 4@s is a lot pushy |pg||
nt|kit: Still, on a better day 4@S might have made|pg||
nt|athene: worth a mention here that south bids 2@D as a cue rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: here the matter should rest|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is more clearly a cue raise of hearts because south can't want to show diamonds naturally, after west bid them|pg||
nt|athene: given south passed over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but he might well have great clubs (e.g. 7 solid) and want to bid clubs naturally|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not clear 2@C should be a cue|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ady: surely west wont sit for 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: south got a bit over-excited here, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: THAT IMO IS A GROSS OVERBID|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D says "i have a good hand with hearts", 2@H says "good for you, let's play 2@H"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if he really wants, he can go 3@H saying "i have a REALLY good heart raise" but that's about all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: next door meckwell have powered themselves to 4@h north-south and east-west are mulling over a save|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|swanson: Yes, but North will fear ducking any red suit card from dummy for fear of giving up the contract.|pg||
nt|athene: south has no top heart honour and not the @H10 or @H9, so he should take that as a warning - his partner might just be bidding on a very good suit but nothing else|pg||
nt|athene: if south had better hearts it would be a lot more reasonable to be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: since if partner hasn't got a great suit he should have a decent hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|ady: kib suggest down 1|pg||
nt|ady: maybe after no cover of J@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: seriously why south bid as he did is perplexing - surely you know the propensity of pards overcalls at this level|pg||

nt|joest: we have had a bunch of lead changes.  This match has been close throughout and remains so with 10 boards left|pg||

nt|wygbe1: should n bid 2c, planning to pass any response?|pg||

nt|swanson: IT is very considerate of the players to be giving us such a close match.  Many of the realy round matches were surprising runaways.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: interesting that north chooses double rather than 2@H|pg||

nt|ady: nice lay for n/s   but still seems only 11 tricks in hearts   unless diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe they play negative free bids? (immediate 2@H would be non-forcing)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|swanson: early|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an auction where it is almost never a winning action to balance.  Don't even look at your hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Cohler hates to sell to 2@D with a stiff diamond, but has no convenient way into the auction|pg||
nt|joest: and that's for the best!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 2NT in other room, will fare a lot worse.|pg||

nt|joest: of course if they roll 600 he'll forgive him|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to double on hands like that it means partner can never ever pass them|pg||

nt|wygbe1: west having trouble envisioning red v white overcall that wont produce game|pg||

nt|athene: he still has a better hand for play in spades than he might have|pg||

nt|bessi2: I fell 3@s is about the value bid.. I think pass is too cautious|pg||
nt|athene: i think cayne should just have bid 2@S over 2@D, personally|pg||
nt|athene: if partner passes with 18 and 5 decent trumps and it makes +1....he has a right feel a bit miffed|pg||
nt|athene: of course Seamon never feels miffed :) but he has a right to there|pg||

mb|p|nt|wygbe1: i would think dbl by w would show both majors - maybe he bid 2h for the lead, expecting to be outbid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i remember in bridge magazine bidding panels, when Tony Forrester thought it was obvious to double, he would just put "i lead a trump" as his proposed bid :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: North's eyes sort of rolled from side to side at dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|bessi2: I don't like to say it.. but I feel south got what he deserved with that 3@s bid|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|swanson: Could one double with 4-2-2-5, planning to pull 2@H to 3@C?|pg||
nt|swanson: to 2@S I mean|pg||
nt|joest: i suppose.  When I do that it goes 3@d on my left and partner bids 3@h :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Then you have to bid 3@S.  Just have a few values for the double.|pg||
nt|swanson: It is never far wrong just to bid one's suit, however.|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: when I 'expand' on a convention, bad things usually happen|pg||

nt|bessi2: looked pretty normal.. although it was clear that something was amiss,  looked like at leas 50hcp in the deck.. but he should rather trust his pd instead of  his aggressive opps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|athene: often the best partnerships have one very solid bidder and one more creative|pg||
nt|roswolf: creative =crazy!?|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzfg: players have left for a short break|pg||
nt|athene: of course if EW were getting to game anyway, NS were losing a lot of imps|pg||
nt|bessi2: that was not for sure if south passes|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: i did|pg||
nt|roswolf: the Great Man not sane - oh my:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry private|pg||
nt|roswolf: the pace of play is slow are there time penalties in this competition?|pg||
nt|bessi2: but what a 4@h bid by Versace with a passed pd... I think he was mostly hoping north would bid 4@s, with an outside chance that 4@h was making.. very rarely will 4@h be doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: the open room is on bd 14|pg||
nt|athene: west has a reasonable hand with a good fit, but much better if partner has four trumps|pg||

pc|sA|nt|swanson: This hand is a demostration of how difficult it is to 'settle' for minor suit games when 3NT is a possibility.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: it's easier at imps b/c you don't get punished for being in five of a minor instead of 3NT if they bothmake|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bessi2: the bidding progressed in the same manner in the open room until that 4@c bid where proojinen bid 4@h, probably because their 1@h opening is often only 4 cards I beliee|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: hmm north cant believe south has 4 card support and passed over 2@S|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: well east could see the 5-2 fit might be ok if his pd has two spades and a doubleton heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: if they play std count south has to have four? wouldn't raise on two would he|pg||

nt|brolucius: Unless you play 9-10.|pg||

nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|joest: Meckwell have arrived in 6@h on these cards at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: very competitive in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is not such a bad contract for NS, is it?|pg||
nt|athene: especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is decent... 2 finesses, not to mention the very live possibility of a @d lead from the K|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, diamond lead from the king is quite possible|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: good 6@H contract here, reached in other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Danger is getting too high -- they will certainly be in the slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: seems they should reach it after this start|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a good hand for 'serious 3NT"|pg||
nt|roswolf: well depending on the style of vul weak 2's i think 4@S is automatic here|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would just bid 4@s directly with the north hand.. |pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Of course, 7@H can make -- and maybe it would out of desparation|pg||
nt|joest: playing that Boyd must cue bid a diamond control no matter how bad his hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n bids blackwood, will find out no diam king|pg||
nt|kit: 4@D is not a diamond control -- it is a last train sort of bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|swanson: An improbable spade lead would make 6@H difficult for declarer.|pg||
nt|athene: this won't work out well|pg||
nt|athene: now the @SK gets exposed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: when versace can't overruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: lol.. versace will drop his pd's K of @s|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S is RKC|pg||
nt|joest: ic|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: not showing the void|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer might just throw his diamond loser on the third club|pg||
nt|athene: and play for both kings onside|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: if clubs continued declarer might well divine the trump position|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|athene: but the failure to play the third club is itself suspicious|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well done|pg||
nt|joest: a trump start seems best|pg||
nt|wygbe1: diam lead will probly speed up the play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: best lead -- now declarer has problems|pg||
nt|kit: far from clear how this hand should be played|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to make it now to keep the lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer counts 5 hearts, 1 spade, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds - needs another two tricks.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: of course, west can also NOT overruff the third club with @SKxx, as a nice grosvenor|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bessi2: now he can play the club throw the diamond and be sure |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: now obvious:)|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer hooks hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: he might decide that west would have bid with all he has AND the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: like a 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe ruff a club and lead a low diamond?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, it's all a bit irrelevant in 3|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Sunday Times recently rated being a BBO VG operator as the 7th most difficult job in the world.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  a couple of possibilities|pg||
nt|swanson: What did BBo commentator rank?|pg||
nt|daman: this is now the last board of this session   first of all we would like to thank our wonderful operator   Aysa    bravo    secondly we thank the ACBL for permitting us to bring ...|pg||
nt|daman: this event to you    we also thank Jan Martel for organizing this Vugraph|pg||
nt|brolucius: They only gave the top 500.|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't 2@D mostly a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is weak NT, not 4333  OR   @D & @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: thanks you to Roland Wald for coordinating the vugraph |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H asks  & 2N = weak NT, not 4333|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to David, Ed, Roland and Al for their keen insights into the handds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: BBO commentator the easiest job of them all. We are great players when we can see all 52 cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Many thanks, Asya! Also, our thanks to BBO for allowing us to watch this great tournament free of charge. Excellent!|pg||

nt|daman: next session begins in 32 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a relay system saves you the trouble of using Stayman.|pg||

nt|daman: I had a friend tell me yesterday that the BBO vugraph was such wonderful entertainment she would gladly pay to watch|pg||
nt|othered1: Here east managed to become declarer.  When the responder  to the relays is declarer, the opposition often has a defense-enhancing amount of information.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Traitor!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i take mastercard & visa -- no checks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NS+1|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not while they still allow 1NT contracts. Who would pay to watch those?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: click on MOVIE and overwrite along board 11|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: okay fixed it :)|pg||
nt|daman: in Canada   we do not have checks    we have cheques|pg||
nt|brolucius: They could charge $5 to watch any session where no commentator made a really stupid comment. That would be acceptable.|pg||

nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest: and that looks to be it|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: a great hand to end a great match on|pg||
nt|athene: sorry as a spec points out, even with the @SK west would not have a 2nt overcall but he might have a double|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 10 mins from now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: when the @H8 falls first round declarer has a guess which way to play for 4-1 trumps - he can pick either up|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: even rolling this would not be good enough so congratulations to the Spector team|pg||
nt|joest: and thanks to all the players for a great match|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|joest: thanks operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: good result for Schwartz in the open room.. 4@h seems like a very fragile contract|pg||
nt|athene: that is why the 8 is an obligatory falsecard from 108xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not sure what the difference is between this and a simple 4@H from east over 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2@C asks if versace has a good hand, 2@D says "no" so lauria settles for game|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: lauria has played with versace for 20 years and versace has never had extras, but lauria is hopeful there will be a first time|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: kranyak will surely play a spade now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: commentator's curse|pg||
nt|athene: another obligatory falsecard to give a guess:- south drops the 8 from @HA108x there when declarer leads to the king|pg||
nt|bessi2: hmm... don't see why he wanted to open up either minor|pg||
nt|bessi2: why he would want to that is|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bessi2: A spec suggests that Kranyak may have interpreted his pd's 3 of @s as suit preferance|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bessi2: preference|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: versace fiddling around trying to find out which way trumps can be 4-1|pg||
nt|bessi2: declarer is on track and will make this|pg||
nt|athene: okie, he got it right|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|nt|swanson: Yes, congratulations to the Spector team and condolences to the Washington team.  They played outstanding bridge for five days and were unlucky at the very end.|pg||
nt|bessi2: but why then not a higher club the 9 for instance, as many kibs suggest, I cannot say|pg||
nt|athene: this is tough |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the normal play when you have Axxx trumps in defence is to hold up the ace at least once, usually twice|pg||
nt|bessi2: good duck by Schwartz|pg||
nt|bessi2: another heart play now is no good it seems|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must start diamonds now|pg||
nt|athene: now if versace plays another trump, Schwartz can play @HA, spade and versace can't get to dummy to draw the last trump|pg||
nt|bessi2: I think... I get headaches trying to analyse these sort of hands|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond is a better shot for declarer but it still does not work; north just goes @DK, @HA, spade and again you can't get to dummy to draw the @H10|pg||
nt|bessi2: GIB says -1.. there we have it|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
nt|athene: versace thinking about ways to endplay north to lead away from the @DK if he gets a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all down one from here|pg||
nt|bessi2: if ace and another @d then Schartz can win cash ace of @h and play a spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ferlema: apurate porque estan haciendo los de lo seniors|pg||
nt|athene: let's see how it made in the other room|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wygbe1: thx and gn all|pg||
nt|swanson: Thanks BBO.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|athene: interesting play from west in the other room, just not touching trumps for a long time|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: that worked out really well when he was able to cash many tricks without suffering a ruff|pg||
nt|bessi2: wait.. if now a spade.. then ruff home.. cash k of clubs and ace and another D right ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: just another trump ofc|pg||
nt|athene: ah, you can endplay north?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the trump now works|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One trick short on a trump return|pg||
nt|athene: north just sits there with @DK and a cashing spade, basically|pg||
nt|athene: of course south has to keep his clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: Schwartz will work this out I believe|pg||
nt|reisig: 100%|pg||
nt|bessi2: for a decent 22 imp lead|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that north misdefended in the other room - he could have thrown his third diamond on the third round of clubs|pg||
nt|bessi2: but surely the next segment should have started by now :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They never penalise them anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this has been extremely slow|pg||
nt|athene: time penalties in bridge do seem ridiculously arbitrary and unclear|pg||
nt|athene: compared with chess :)|pg||
nt|athene: in chess, it's sort of clearcut :) of course technically much easier to implement|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2hrs 45 mins for 15.75 bds is excessive and they tool short breaks as well|pg||
nt|bessi2: especially difficult in knockout matches|pg||
nt|athene: as far as i can make out, the policy on slow play in bridge seems to be "don't do it or we will be cross, and we might penalize you, except we probably won't, unless we do, which ...|pg||
nt|athene: we probably won't"|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite easy pairs must be split for future segments|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in teams of 6, you could have a rule that the slow pairs have to sit out|pg||
nt|roswolf: playong in an unfamiliar pship for 16 bds would hurt:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed.. the schedule is more like guidelines in the knocout competitions at the nationals, which I like by the way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I strongly disagree|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Time is part of the game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|reisig: well ..almost 100%  :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with Roland here - disrupts the shedule for everyone else if a pair is too slow|pg||
nt|bessi2: :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: well that has let the contract through according to GIB|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: he needed to rise with the queen|pg||
nt|bessi2: disrupts nothing at this point.. since, if I am not mistaken, the same boards aren't being played in all matches|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some play better if they can think forever, and they should not be allowed to|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Else they must change the rules|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chorush: spade 5 still beats|pg||
nt|bessi2: and curtains for declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bessi2: at long last.. thx all|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: Making?|pg||
nt|roswolf: chess clocks would keep the times but deciding on effective sanctions is difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't be serious, Bruce|pg||
nt|reisig: My kind of claim :) :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
