nt|yuval10: Q@s might be useful sometimes as well, and then you have the AK@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: and if 4@s is making, such as when E has AQ @h after you, then 5@d deems to go down a lot|pg||

nt|rensph: 5 tricks available for NS here, but have to be careful not to let the spade trick disappear|pg||
nt|yuval10: it might looks normal for N to try K@s now, since S is likely to have @s holding and not the A@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he's affraid that W has the same hand with A@c and without Q@s, then a @s can go away over the @d|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: wyk³¹daj¹c dziadka powiedzia³em: Wojtem - mam nadziejê, ¿e nie by³ to niewygodny Splinter....|pg||
nt|galois85: for making the hand was club to ace and club and endplay. 10 to italy|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe 4@S over 41H will get a @S lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible.|pg||
nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: this board should be shown to those who claims not to open weak 2 with Hxx in the other major :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3@S was clear misclick|pg||
nt|leao:  hi there :)|pg||

nt|panosk: 3NT not good here with spade lead, beter end up in 5@D|pg||
nt|leao:  Shah knows his pard is very short in @c|pg||
nt|leao:  and he has prime values in the no-clubs suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 down|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes Henk noted this for me... a BB winner|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: sorry I have yo comment in th open one lol bye|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  will EW find 4 Sp now?|pg||
nt|riccho:  was it only 2@s? |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello  all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the contract was 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: co nienajlepiej siê dzieje w polskiej dru¿ynie jeli zmienia siê pary|pg||
nt|frankaus: expecting  - 3rg try :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3rd :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S may be passed and would be a good board for NL.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
nt|leao:  stiff ace claimed its toll|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar with the North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ryskiel who will be commenting in Polish|pg||
nt|peachy: bye all, I was called to another room, Enjoy!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: I agree and learnt at very late stage:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: the count in the @C immediately known after trick one|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C is fairly cheap 4card support and a preempt strange :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gronkvist:  2@c puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|frankaus: i was always reliant on a typyyyssste|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rdble show this same number of cards in majors|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@c of course show majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: 0708 in Washington DC |pg||
nt|riccho:  hi shirley :) |pg||
nt|leao:  i like 5@h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N showed minimum and S hand is not that strong for the raise.|pg||

nt|antoniz: 2kier-czwarty kolor|pg||

nt|sybarra: has a lot to do with little transportation |pg||
nt|riccho:  If the defense is not able to punish W for his bidding, will W go even further with his preempt bidding? |pg||
nt|le joker: nice auctions|pg||
nt|frankbo: u thk so|pg||
nt|frankbo: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i like 1NT by E more|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: opening or rebid over 1@s|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ekspecki wist w 8@d|pg||
nt|bcmandal: clubs 3-3 5d makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: Hello :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must admit too hard to avoid 3NT here, i'm i wudnt have|pg||
nt|frankbo: guess it shows 18-19|pg||
nt|le joker: they play 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: then opening :)|pg||
nt|frankbo: now we are talking|pg||
nt|frankbo: def 1N opening|pg||
nt|le joker: only 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i am so used with precisin that i cant imagine @H opening with 19 pts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: precision'|pg||
nt|bebechira: indeed.. fav vulnerability as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was surprised E didnt take the save |pg||
nt|bobholl: was afraid of 6 may be|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: ah thats trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not that easy to be reach..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Dr Raghavan|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot off waisted values in @c ontrack -in diamonds ,but here you need thos e honors |pg||
nt|raghavan: GM marukku - again we meet|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
nt|sybarra: true Bob |pg||
pc|dT|nt|bcmandal: 2s+1d|pg||
nt|bebechira: this must have been the reason|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 1@c be the opening then? |pg||
pc|d3|nt|bcmandal: 3s+1d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: nt|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hey|pg||
nt|sybarra: but does get the hand across in one bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi welcome |pg||

nt|leao:  is 3@d a stopper ask?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: stand corrected.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this sits nicely for 4 @H |pg||

nt|bobholl: and let's be fair it surely is in the 50% RANGE|pg||
pc|sK|nt|leao:  argh|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
nt|panosk: E must try to ruff a couple of @D losers in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9@H a value card.|pg||
nt|daman: this will not be good|pg||
nt|leao:  no, it doesnt rate to be, at all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  so they start with a 20+ IMP deficit to recover|pg||
nt|leao:  have a nice one|pg||
nt|leao:  sandwich, i mean|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play clubs or Hearts knowing Spade Q is a possible entry|pg||
nt|leao:  at least it wasnt doubled|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||
nt|veistikke:  3@H = 6@h 4+ Minor? |pg||
nt|veistikke:  inn their system?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: shud also be carefull of clubs as he/she knows that S is 5-4 at aleast hence no more than 3-4 cards in rest suits|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would any bid 2@S after 2@C=MM from S. I would.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome.|pg||
nt|runnerup: what they gave you you gave it back -decl..didnt make his @s 2. @s trick |pg||
nt|riccho:  50 imps... |pg||
nt|bobholl: no imps :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  luckily for NS, only an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they had a little conversation about it :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak|pg||
nt|leao:  they must know they are well ahead|pg||
nt|bebechira: the battle for 6th place in the juniors is unbelivable...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: the fridly D layout would prob get dec home on any lead  on last|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 2nd pass from EW with 12 points ..|pg||
nt|leao:  fewer advances, and all that|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: bêd¹ gra³y w piki|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max a partial. 3@C or 3@H.|pg||
nt|mich-b: so what ..thats not a KO match ? Dont they want to catch the leaders and try to win the event?|pg||
nt|daman: easy 4@H game here    I will get some lemonade|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 countries battle for the last spot in WC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the israel /belg. sounds like the match we saw yesterday here.  about 10 imps per bd changed hands|pg||
mb|4H|nt|possessed: an aggressive one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: really|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  She is very aggressiv but this ...:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, I humbly submit that I was proved wrong:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i open  - has 27 zars |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like another 4@s hand|pg||
nt|athene: similar thing, 1@C is weak balanced or a big hand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3nt senza storia|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: will end up at 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is close, but 3nt is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult for n/s to get the club suit in now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if W passes it may go X |pg||
nt|rnmalik: may see 2@H being played.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not that clear..|pg||
nt|sybarra: now trying catch up |pg||
nt|riccho:  at least both hungarian teams cannot complain about each other. Both pairs had taken their part to this|pg||
nt|sybarra: never good |pg||
nt|riccho:  12-14 NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: ye|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  hmm South a little passive in my opinion|pg||
nt|chrisky: x or 2nt prommising the minors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: they bid Norths suit,  this isnt easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1NT maybe ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: does 2 nt promise minors? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: over @C+@D nat by opps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 nt is option is if coming in |pg||
nt|rnmalik: x here would bring in @S:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south realise that north not so serious -he did|pg||
nt|riccho:  as I said before, difficult to defend this blast into 3NT bidding sequences|pg||
nt|leao:  lets hope they bid this one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzjs: he chose to pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: live scores in the juniors http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||

nt|riccho:  should be made now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Seems as someting can be of here,|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  passing twice is very passive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and west should at least explore that possibility|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s makeable but need deep finess in @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky the ace of clubs in S |pg||
nt|riccho:  @d5 is a very strange lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4th best |pg||

pc|s6|nt|gronkvist:  E has relly good cards for prepassed hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  would you open 3@D with the southand Johan?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes the second time i thought should wouldbid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: P³aszczykowski?|pg||
nt|antoniz: teraz impas trefl ze wzgledów bezpieczeñstwa|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3@S is easier..|pg||
nt|runnerup: hmm--this makes anyway|pg||
pc|s7|nt|possessed: they can survive with 200 now, not too bad against 100|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2 down again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and why not?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @s K and a weak suit|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,very unusual pass over blkw by your p...i think they'll talk a lot after this match|pg||

pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: ie. bid 3nt over 3@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: he was hesitating between 5 and 10@D |pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|veistikke:  3 h losers with J out|pg||
nt|veistikke:  only way to get it -1 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  this one may be less successful|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In first position its more temptating|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS is only 16 and 15 y and Irma Petersen plays her first champoionship|pg||
nt|antoniz: logiczny pas|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  as in down off the top|pg||

nt|jkotor: na drugim stole trochê dziwnie ta licytacja siê potoczy³a|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice result for israel in other room|pg||
nt|bebechira: they defeated 3h... so no chance for a significant swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in OR  west underled the ace of @C |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: EW need to shift in @C quickly to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: can only be profitable for israel|pg||
pc|dK|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to lose 2H unless play 9|pg||
nt|leao:  that lead must have pinpointed the @s Q|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pinticus: ok now score is ok|pg||
nt|jkotor: N potrzebuje w zasadzie atutów, ale poszed³ "automatyczny" splinter|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  Top on a board is 50; the top 4 scores are within 10 matchpoints; 5th is 100 matchpoints behind|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still team. Do E hope for a slam? Bid 4 and fin.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|gronkvist:  If E has bid 4@h in red and partner has 2 aces and tr Q then slam should be laydown|pg||
nt|pinticus: W open 1@d|pg||
nt|daman: and get off the schneid|pg||

pc|h4|nt|z_lasu: W open 1@d at 3rd seat|pg||

mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||

nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

nt|bebechira: can SHE make?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
nt|pinticus: 4@s OR EW|pg||

nt|le joker: @c lead go down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||
nt|sybarra: ideal bid would be 4 @D as cue and spade raise, (on the way to game) |pg||
nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||
nt|leao:  interesting to see if Ginossar will duck the @c lead... mite make life hard for declarer|pg||

nt|riccho:  the reason for doubling is misterious to me|pg||
nt|daman: not really|pg||
nt|daman: make 5 then|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||
nt|riccho:  dont understand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||
nt|sybarra: record would have fallen Richard|pg||

pc|s3|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is a useful convention here: XX here from E would show doubt about the contract |pg||
nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||
nt|daman: win the @C and play the @S 10|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  2 down again |pg||

nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||

pc|h7|nt|yuval10: South, of the other hand, can already be considered "Veteran". Ida Gronkvist is playing for Sweden in the European Championship for the 3rd time|pg||
nt|sybarra: safe lead but may have pickled pards trump trick|pg||
nt|chrisky: i can see 7 tricks |pg||

pc|h2|nt|psyck: donno, looks too suspesious|pg||

nt|eugenio123: were they swopping? lol    at the end 10 tricks|pg||
nt|saverio: 4@s for NS here|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly it is just one of those magic hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h must show  values and a super @d-fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he bid 1 nt, (2 suited presumably)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: that why I would be nervous |pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" may play 4 sp |pg||
nt|bebechira: south has a hand to double some  high contract for sure|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lotte will bid 5c and the double will come.... but not enough to match 910|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they make +1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question is did W promise 5 @S? |pg||
nt|bobholl: just losing 1@S and 1C not that difficult|pg||
mb|d|nt|eugenio123: 2@s show 5@h gf|pg||

nt|frankbo: 7NT|pg||
nt|le joker: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|loe48: this hand again is almost to good for a weak 2 opener, rather 1s-2s hand|pg||
nt|saverio: since they bid usually 1 or 2 tricks more it shouldnt be difficult for them to get there :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to click pass....but i should :(|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: E could help them :)|pg||

nt|daman: this seems like a routine contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C X can go down by @C lead and duck the @S 2 times|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||

nt|yuval10: not so easy now...|pg||

nt|riccho:  sounded like him|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: they needed to double hook the @H to make    |pg||

nt|riccho:  say it that way: A partnership should resolve the problem to avoid a @s-contract in Bd 10 anyhow. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i disagree with E's pass|pg||

nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||
nt|loe48: and the hand is not worth more imo|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: your countrymates need some support :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 10 the other way!!|pg||
nt|riccho:  sry IÂ´m head shaking|pg||

nt|sybarra: got to keep 'em |pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland loosing to France and Israel leading here (not that they will win) ..things are interesting at the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
nt|loe48: open 1h helped opponents to win 4s|pg||

nt|runnerup: 4 @h seems ok -just careful play needed |pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: this hand may help if the French go too high|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, bd 11 is missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would need valium for coaching here |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: @H|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: S juz to mogl wygrac przebijajac 2 kara ze stolu co postawiloby W w przymusie|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I suggest 2@h by south|pg||
mb|1S|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
nt|veistikke:  got a feeling of 3!nt inn S|pg||
mb|d|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
nt|bobholl: what to bid as S i almost have pity with S :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot... incredible|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would worry  p would raise hts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead in the OR |pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland is not getting too much cricket.. bad weather in London|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  "can|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy to Silna Grupa Pod Wezwaniem?|pg||
nt|mareczek: witajcie :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: and bidding 1@D has already shown weak hand.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good switch.|pg||
nt|leao:  Peter, our operator tells us that 3@s is a moderate hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: the important test England-India will be affected by the english weather|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hi:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ryskiel_: odpowiednio: SZ 6-55 i Fra 11-44|pg||
nt|panosk: biddind shud go like this i think 2@C- 2@S- whatever- pass- 3@H- pass- 3nt- pass- pass or 4@D and then up to the players|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eugenio123: when your opp bids in this way it is sure he's got good stoppers in majors|pg||
nt|riccho:  A10xx in @c ...|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||

pc|h3|nt|yuval10: declarer most likely will find the Q@d , after seeing AK @s A@c in South|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity for declarer that @S4 is so low|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe N should have won ht and returned a @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they are discussing something in dutch :(|pg||
nt|panosk: that makes 4@H even more wrong choice|pg||
nt|leao:  first major swing for england, well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is a lot of brain power being used!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol Shirley.... whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think you say phew|pg||
nt|bebechira: we do indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: coffee biard now|pg||
nt|bebechira: board*|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Instead of 2D should bid 2H to show 3cd supposrt and not game seeking hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: Poland is now up in a comfertable lead, and not undeserved by play|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, but I can't see what declarer was playing for|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: neither do i |pg||
nt|cicus: when he did not let it ride|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: i na oko 500 na 4@s w obronie jesli takowa znajda.|pg||
nt|mareczek: mo¿na siê pokusiæ o 5@h po 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x a single suiter.|pg||
nt|sybarra: speaking of dutch,  I wonder what the difference is in the ending of their names,  beek vs beeke |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: have no ideq|pg||
nt|panosk: a bit of arguing -not a lot though- keeps pard awake:) no harm there |pg||
nt|riccho:  Do u think there is junior someqhere who would pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|riccho:  there it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: have seen 20+passes with 12 count the last week|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1-2 position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|loe48: a lucky 6c made in start may have stunned the opponents|pg||
nt|cicus: she|pg||
nt|cicus: a bold 2NT now by W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s from N should be interesting...will E find the A@h lead and continuation?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an aggresive choice with that hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hmm with the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|mareczek: mozna te¿ zrobiæ próbê szlemikow¹, karta W jest tego warta|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: ano, znajac agresje mlodych pierwsze co pomysli W jak zobaczy 1NT czy by tu szlemika nie zagrac :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: trf to @C.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mareczek: i po stwierdzeniu braku zatrzymania pik zagraæ 5@h|pg||
nt|chrisky: an e...:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if this is drury they play a strange version :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: like a forcing stayman |pg||
nt|bebechira: I wonder if the yougsters parents watching this...they can let us know please|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  east makes it difficult to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d = void @d, 6-9 points and 2 keycards or 15+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: adn 2 nt is usually honor 3 or better  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the relay suit saying "I like clubs" |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to reach 3NT |pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt shud be spade fit and forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: omg, a pushed bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry wasnt what I meant |pg||
mb|2S|nt|timverbeek:  my guess is all pass now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pewnie jeszcze padnie 5 trefli - 5 karo i wreszcie 5 kier|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  west to the rescue|pg||
nt|yuval10: S IMO has a lot more than enough to carry on. He can see slam's making against A@s QJ@h Q@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes even less than that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @H lead, may be 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S by E now|pg||
nt|riccho:  really|pg||
nt|sybarra: can that be possible here? |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|cicus: hmm, it does not sound like a strong NT now, does it?|pg||
nt|cicus: might even show minors?|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@c - 5@h |pg||
nt|mareczek: brak cue bidu pik|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: choæ ju¿ 5 karo jest bez sensu|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@d powinno obiecywac zatrzymanie w pominietym przez partnera kolorze|pg||
nt|riccho:  same weird lead as at the other table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying for the club ruff is my guess |pg||
nt|riccho:  compare the 3@s here with what W had done in bd 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand a far better (imo)|pg||
nt|riccho:  is this really the difference between red and white?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||
nt|vbman: when l was a junior ,,, l noted that it was the slams that made us lose matches or win them|pg||
nt|redds: trudny pierwszy wist|pg||
nt|antoniz: po ka¿dym -1 lub -2|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like going for slam|pg||
nt|panosk: i dont like 2nt as a choice 4@C i think is more descriptive|pg||
nt|panosk: W shudnt|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi panos|pg||
nt|panosk: hi |pg||
nt|le joker: they are not going to call the game|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|eugenio123: it seems somethinh like -1|pg||
nt|redds: zobaczymy na co zdecyduje sie popularny Idol|pg||
nt|sybarra: from a spec,  a beek is a small river;  westerbeek means river in the west|pg||
nt|raghavan: North has done well to land in S contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south pushes a bit to be sure of at least reaching the right game|pg||
nt|athene: if he had just invited he would never be able to show the shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough lesson for N here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lucky:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: another non-making 50% game|pg||
nt|vbman: good lead indeed|pg||
nt|gregpog: :)|pg||
nt|panosk: since E is a passed hand no much chance for misunderstanding but if he wasnt shows a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
nt|le joker: J@h give the contract|pg||
nt|le joker: @d looks better|pg||
mb|3H|nt|timverbeek:  extremely normal 1@S by north|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I would do the same|pg||
nt|mareczek: widac ¿e siê zrozumieli jednak|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: no coz...|pg||
nt|mareczek: :)|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: pas!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: still thinking :)|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: oby nie myslal w stylu 'mam 17, przeciez wiecej nie moge miec!' :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but it's better we wait for the ping pong lol|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe with some qualms but E bid the obvious game|pg||
nt|cicus: and I can't see how this could go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: what I meant was a "good heart raise"  as oppose to 2 @C asking |pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_:  zgad³em...w koñcu 30-letnie ocieranie siê o m³ód bryd¿ow¹ jakie lady zostawia|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: rafa ominiea|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: nice swithc|pg||
nt|cicus: at least now that N decided to go passive|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|bobholl: ah ha netherlands coming back :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: on a spade lead S takes the first @C and shoots back a spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: N should try the 7@h |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie piêknê s¹ powroty od dentysty...witam:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: might want to get children (trumps)  off the street fast |pg||
nt|bebechira: and A big suprpise Lotte's mother is with us... welcome |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: and she does|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns very high here but even without opponents opening may be they dont have metodes to stay low |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Hands like these to not to overbid win matches. 3@S was weak and should have been passed after call over call.|pg||
nt|vbman: difficult to stay away from game after 1sp overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A dia lead could be a good start for EW|pg||
nt|eugenio123: right defence for poland|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D last chance to make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|timverbeek:  if you pass every time with these kinds of hands|pg||
nt|cicus: and N still has @CA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: at least this is how it goes in books|pg||
nt|yuval10: but E didn't have any other choices ...so -1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good play,  and made.|pg||
nt|panosk: of course double dummy 5spades make |pg||
nt|panosk: play 10@D from dummy|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome,  this must be nail biting time for here |pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Lotte's mother.... Lotte Leufkens as well :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: s hopes @S are not 22 :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|timverbeek:  you will loose so many part scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: still have some play here...if E finesse @c prematurely then the def. might score a trump promotion through @s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|dzeronimo: +2 impy z tego wszystkiego|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lottel: ok, so hello everybody|pg||
pc|hA|nt|possessed: we will have 3 swings, 1 for sweden 2 for poland|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay:  why not @H ruff?|pg||
nt|eugenio123: now donati can double finesse @d|pg||
nt|raghavan: i think 3S better than playing 2NT|pg||
nt|leao:  Reiter will have to switch to @h now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: cash heart king before low club|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panosk: same :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eugenio123: ping pong has just started lol |pg||

nt|leao:  oops|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bebechira: must be hard for you to watch this|pg||
nt|lottel: i am using Lottes account, i am Oda Lottes mother|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psyck: yes, he did well to get to the right strain, getting to the right level too was too much to ask for|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  well played by east|pg||
nt|yuval10: but E did wisely here|pg||
nt|bobholl: using your daugthers account :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|timverbeek:  I would start with D and then bid 2@H with east|pg||
nt|leao:  2 @d tricks will see declarer home now|pg||
nt|veistikke:  -1 still giving points to N/S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: or return club king, this was too easy for declarer|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1 off|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes vul|pg||
nt|runnerup: east feels press -has to keep all hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the spots are in N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: I would have no Nails left at all to watch this |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay:  she can squeeze South in rounded|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: 2NT will go many down 3 or 4 down|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: west didn't suspect a singleton king for the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|panosk: thats lack of table experience|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eugenio123: small diramonds now|pg||
nt|leao:  well said :)|pg||
nt|lottel: yes it is, let's hope for no more disasters|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||

pc|s4|pc|dT|nt|ryskiel_: mieszn - nie ma palcówki|pg||
nt|panosk: no player wud ever play 9@D under honor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: declarer's failure to play spades immediately should mean north has spade jack (near certain inference)|pg||
nt|szalay:  she could|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|yuval10: they were still hoping for more from a match vs Austria, a team that its average scores so far was lose 4:25|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: 63 VP's in 14 matches, and 16 VP's now against Sweden|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|yuval10: many members of our Juniors team remember how Austria played the spoiler in Riccione 2005, defeating Israel in the next to last round and handing the gold medal in the schools ...|pg||

nt|henryb:  The road to bad boards is paved with greed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  east is lucky north had a bid |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are playing negative free bids....which means South is slotted to have a very poor hand|pg||

mb|3H|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: brawo, na drugim stole doszli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||

nt|sybarra: this hand will not be easy |pg||
nt|bebechira: and more imps for Lotte now?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||

nt|sybarra: should we call it "not fun" |pg||
nt|mich-b: I would prefer a "trap pass" with East , playing for penalties...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: last 2 boards|pg||

nt|leao:  off one with defence cashin out|pg||
pc|cT|nt|raghavan: looks like making 4 |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|leao:  4@s, however, wud be many off :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i will try @H... one honour with N WILL HELP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: it is suggested that this should be taken in dummy and a @H led - but what if N ducks smoothly?|pg||
nt|szalay:  call hr magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  her|pg||
nt|szalay:  and give her Hermione role in next chapter|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the @HK is not easy to duck although what will W hold to justify jumping to 3@H?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw better to play Q: not so easy to duck|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: AS OP LEAD IE|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eugenio123: just a question of overtricks|pg||

pc|d3|nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
nt|rnmalik: needed passive defence, small @S.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||

nt|bebechira: :( yes ...confident that all finesses are working|pg||

nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||

nt|rnmalik: only a NT contract can be made. A@S and ruff would set any other contract.|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  perhaps not - I was assuming E would lead the @dA|pg||
nt|psyck: @d punches will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  He will go down anyway on the @s lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's overcall is marginal, and it forced him to an uncomfotable bid in the 2nd round|pg||

nt|raghavan: marrkku - can it be made by cross ruffing|pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h is a bit too much. If you play a WK NT style. Partner should expect a 15 HCP Hand BAL type with 2@h already. No need to raise the bidding more than that|pg||
