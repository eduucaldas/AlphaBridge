nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi all -- will get the names in shorttly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Larry and Jack|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get feisty over an opening strong club/nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could generate a bit of action|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   north may start 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: Helllo everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Wlcome everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good luck Ross|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Roland and Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to watch one of the matches in Spingold Round 32|pg||
nt|peachy: This is segment 3 of 4|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: west might take action|pg||
nt|bessi2: south may psych with 3n|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome back to the last session of the round of 32 of the Spingold.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|joest: North has a typical problem, which I usually solve by just raising to 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: yes partner might have only 3 but other calls distort.  Plus raising comes in handy if partner can compete to the three level with four or five clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=BAL, 8-10|pg||
nt|othered1: guess they play 15-17|pg||
nt|peachy: Your commentators, at least for the start are Krishna Chakravartula and Raija Davis, vugraph operator Bruce Gowdy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: hello all and welcome back to toronto |pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 14+ balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: some would try negative double and hope to survive.  I used to do that but gave it up|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Kit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = baron with modified responses|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows 4@S and denies 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: they play stong NT and big club|pg||
nt|roswolf: system card says strong presumably 15-17|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: the icemen are straightforward bidders|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: hey kit|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play that a double (or 1@S) covers 4 or 5 spades, you can use the remaining action as take-out for the minors, but that is not standard.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ira and Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: still.. 3@s was making so not a bad result in itself|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3@S   and 4 without the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible [without login] via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west protects|pg||
nt|daman: obviously 1@C would tend to show 18+ or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|chick: would W bid 3@S after 3@C P P?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible [without logon]  via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it is becoming a more popular treatment|pg||
nt|chorush: Welcome back everyone to the thir quarter of the finlals of the Grand National Teasms|pg||
nt|joest: hi ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: somehow I don't think this was the auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D is RKC in @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably|pg||
nt|ady: more likely double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: session scores are posted at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-32|pg||
nt|peachy: Pardon, operator name is Joe Stokes, sorry Joe!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Hi Kit, Hi Larry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|larrymori: hi Ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Al|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 w/queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: Since South had not promised four clubs with his opening bid, he feels entitled to compete one level higher.|pg||
nt|kit: tricky hand to play due to the diamond blockage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible via   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|joest: jack of diamonds is a nice card.  Permits this to make a slam even with losers in both majors|pg||
nt|chorush: About the quickest 11 imps I've seen in a while|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it was a super slam|pg||
nt|joest: what kind of hand would you bid 3@s on as a passed hand that would not Drury?  |pg||
nt|joest: I have my own theories but so what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi All.  We started late and I'm just catching up.|pg||
nt|othered1: When south shows @S with 2@C bid isn't double very pushy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: women's semi-final for Wagar   eventually show up at  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2011/02/wagar/|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: I don't see bidding 3@H with 4-3-3-3, 4 clubs, 3 hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can expect his partner to be very short in clubs and hopes that his 9 points will be enough 3@H, despite holding only 3-card support.|pg||
nt|bessi2: @h guess in 3@s though but if they take their @d ruff.. then declarer will have to decide whether N started with 2128 or 2227|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kit: both 3@C and 3@H need to make to show a real profit, and that just isn't likely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: It appears that with favorable trump lie, Rodwell will discard 2 spades on his long diamonds to make 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT = 2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: very but west has never been shy of bidding|pg||
nt|henryb:  With the diamonds behaving nicely, it looks like this may make|pg||
nt|daman: given that the double should show @Ss    do we have any 2@S bidders?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: He cannot expect his side to hold 9 hearts between them, or West would have doubtless bid 3@H himself, following the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
nt|daman: saves a level|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  why should the X show @s when S showed majors?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: halftime scorest  at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-32|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Boyd is taking control as South after  1@D-1@S//4@H  [bal, slam try with 4@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he couldn't diagnose the perfect minor fits either  so 6@S in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Palmer's first decision of the set and she is taking her time.|pg||
nt|loe48: not a bad grandslam if you know what kings south have|pg||
nt|othered1: Not with south showing 4 or 5@S.|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is actually deceiving watching all hands since the percentage play is to double finesse the @h and go down in 3@s|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess the heart position in 3 spades as well|pg||
nt|santyclz: Clerkin-Clerkin system summary:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=803&pid=605|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: and with a stiff club West might have bid 3@H anyway with offensive orientation|pg||
nt|kit: and not surprisingly, it is likely that both contracts will go down 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fans of the Law of Total Tricks will smile tolerantly and say 'What did they expect?'|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd pretty much has to hope South has ace-doubleton of hearts to even have a chance|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention that the ace of spades is on side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a new concept for Beth Palmer|pg||
nt|daman: oh sorry     that's true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1:  1 seed  Diamond trails by 45   8 Zimmermann is behind by 39   and  our match  2 Nickell needs to catchup|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: South is "marked" with ace of hearts, since North is assumed to have ace of spades|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2011&b=Summer&c=daily_bulletins  The ACBL Summer Nationals results, and other info, from Toronto|pg||
pc|d3|nt|larrymori: he can pitch 2 @cs too|pg||
nt|chorush: but he may have to guess well to do it right|pg||
nt|larrymori: he needs to play on @ds now|pg||
nt|chorush: He has to worry that if he draws the next rump, when he leads a diamond they will win, blocking the suit and destroy the entry to his hand in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- he doesn't know opponents can't lead a second club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did NOT have option to open weak 2@D   EW play Flannery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Clerkins play a form of Precision  i'm going to guess that the NT ranges are   1st/2nd & not-vul 3rd = 14-16   3rd vul & 4th = 15-17|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: I thot 2@C showed 1 Major|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have considered bidding 2nt with his max|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: or suppose opponents just duck 2 rounds of diamonds.  then he only has 5 trumps, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 3@D was normal i think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|sybarra2: this is closest match I am told |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: However, it will be very difficult for Boyd to find this defense|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: he is playing along dummy reversal lines -- perhaps planning on ruffing another club, hoping diamonds 3-3, and then end-playing opponents -- very sensible |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 3@C did indeed go one off at the other table, as can see (top left), so this third heart by East was not a wise investment. Fortunately, the stakes are low.|pg||
nt|larrymori: thats why it seemed that he needed to attack @ds after 2 rounds of trumps while he had 2 entries|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he gets @d right he will make|pg||
nt|henryb:  but he did not|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: that risked a club or diamond getting ruffed|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: not the best return|pg||
nt|henryb:  but the defense solved it for him|pg||
nt|peachy: If you wish to see multiple table, or secpond table (without log-in) http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|kit: He will now try to cash 2 diamonds, but unfortunately it won't work|pg||

nt|odysseus69: welcome to Wagar final- both finalists survived a narrow sqeak- 1imp and 3imps in semis|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The players are at the table, discussing systems, we'll be starting in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: von Arnim Auken are regarded by many as the best women's pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades a likely spot - declarer may play North for QJ of spades and go 1 down|pg||
nt|odysseus69: solid multi|pg||

nt|odysseus69: but in long match its a mistake to torture yourself about overtrick|pg||

nt|brolucius: Add 4 more IMPs to the Total Tricks scales.|pg||
nt|joest: teh 14-16 NT range prevented north from getting his spade suit in|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: i guess that is 15 after all|pg||
nt|joest: but just barely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It always takes a hand or two for the VGOP to warm up.|pg||
nt|kit: I think his play was the sensible one|pg||
nt|larrymori: sure but you have to take a position|pg||
nt|henryb:  So 2 imps for Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are 3 within 11/12, but yes this is the closest|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: our operator is known more as a Player and Commentator than as operator -- he's learning that the toughest part of the job is following the play of the hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Finally, running scores will be on http://www.bridgewinners.com/, both from Wagar Final and from Spingold which is now at Round 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: big swing on opening lead at other table|pg||
nt|psyck: this is a more exciting hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: key was 2 of clubs lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: let's try a different 1@C auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 5+@S GF or 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Meck then bid 1N or show @C??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd guess 1N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but 2@C is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Palmer probably bids at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: East is considering....|pg||
nt|ady: not much here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 14-16|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: After the Stayman auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3NT, you should favor a major-suit lead. Do not worry that responder holds a major; worry instead that the opener does not and will be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well-stocked in the minor suits.|pg||
nt|roswolf: pushy nv game here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: the jack of hearts looks fairly normal|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson-Boyd play puppet -- this will hurt them, since West will show 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd guess that jeff will bid 1NT and r=eric would bid 2@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass requests clarification|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s -1 seems possible|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi Bruce,  assume this is now really you :) |pg||
nt|santyclz: This has been a very close match with the lead traded back and forth many times.|pg||
nt|peachy: Anything else a kib might wantm ask me of CK|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on a @c guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Zach, no score entered on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please do it manually|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Give me contract, declarer and number of tricks and I will give you the code|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think S bid 2N; I think S passed and W bid 2N|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@d by E , 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK  3DE=|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Click on MOVIE and insert 3DE= along board 1|pg||
nt|daman: Zach missed the bidding    4@S is the final contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south did bid something is declarer more or less likely to get the clubs right!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: have to stop at the one level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rosters for all teams at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/rosters/2011/02/SPINGOLD/|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: now double of 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: which will warn them, so they can survive in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a chance to double.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, invite or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson considering.  Becker doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will likely shoot out 4@H, and at the unfavorable vul. Rodwell will have to sell out|pg||
nt|larrymori: cons raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod did have Intermediate 2@S available|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cole now considering after Meck's pass.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bold 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: It would not be that one. I'd say 5-7, 4 trumps, with no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did good job with interference of 1@C auction in earlier set too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wagar [Women's KO] halftime scores for Semi-Final   http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2011/02/wagar/|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 4 hearts is beatable but mostly double dummy, so 4S down 1 may in fact be a paying save|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|loe48: what would a 2s bid mean by mech|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and roddy clarifies|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his own spades|pg||
nt|loe48: isnt 2s a ok bid here then, to fast show support|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but its very rare that opener does anyting but pass requesting clarification|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: assuming North doubles, the key will be whether Robinson-Boyd have the understandings to determine they have no spade stopper|pg||
nt|joest: there are other variations of Puppet that avoid this risk but this is the 'original' version.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit, did you invent this or am I imagining things?|pg||
nt|kit: didn't invent it, but I did publicize it|pg||
nt|joest: so now the trick is to get to 5@c and keep the loss to a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson's pass denies a spade stopper -- or at least, it should|pg||
nt|joest: Your name is attached to it in my mind :)|pg||
nt|psyck: W was planning a 3@h limit raise rebid, but will have to decide now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: now at this point what all is forcing?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chorush: To beat 4H, a diamond must be led without touching spades. Then the spade Q is an entry to beat the contract 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Waiting for Berk to finish the hand and I will enter the result.|pg||
nt|roswolf: entries may force east to get them right|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  likely to prosper if they play   cards lay well for them|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is there reason of @H rather than spades?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: this redouble is just a repeat --|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was no doubt thinking of bidding 3@C on the previous round, but he can bid it now.|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like they will survive and get to 5@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: north dorsn't have spades necessarliy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could have 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|loe48: i got it ty..of cos then pass correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck writing something about the double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that covers the administrative stuff|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not many losers -- but are there 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't see them single dummy   maybe peeking at EW cards will help|pg||
nt|psyck: some may choose to open 1@s as E with a hand not strong enough to reverse|pg||
nt|peachy: The Dbl makes the decision to bid game rather easy, declarer's values are behind the doubler and thus better placed|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, South is marked in the auction with virtually nothing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bessi2: indeed.. 2@h is making for sure probably +1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: yes, that is pretty double-dummy, so in practice Rodwell did well to take the vul vs. not save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cole raised to 2@S naturally after Becker 2@C [vs Robinson DBL]|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see 10 but won't rule out that Jerry does.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: X is non-forcing invite to bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably clarifies @H & @S|pg||
nt|psyck: the 6th @h with pd & ruffing potential in hand also helped in the decision|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were lucky that Pettis did not have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: Nicely done -- unlucky to still lose 3 imps on it|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is unlikely so good save|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ok|pg||
nt|peachy: EW System Summary http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=743&pid=210|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: I don't mind opening 1NT on East's shape, but it was a bit of a stretch with Q-J doubleton and such a relatively poor 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks like three more to Spector|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're also playing 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx and hi Raija, welcome |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bessi2: I don't see any way for the defense to mangle this up|pg||
pc|h3|nt|loe48: dia 7 is screaming for h switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck goes for a walk and one of the entourage turns dummy.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H never mentioned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubled  --   sorry I missed Peter Boyd's final bid  :(|pg||
nt|chorush: So this looks like 3 imps to Robinson for the double|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|peachy: Al knows Meckwell system so he will likely explain :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: so with same hand but Rodwell holding @DK they might have found slam after the EW barrage??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Clerkins won the 2010 GNT [Grand National Teams] but earlier in the week they lost in the Semi-Final to eventual winner Spector|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excuse me for using 1st names for the Clerkins, they are brothers, Jerry and Dennis.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd-Robinson were unlucky here that the auction let North double 2@S.  More normally Puppet has the advantage of concealing declarer's distribution.|pg||
nt|kit: 1NT might not be ideal, but that alternatives are really awful|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|peachy: Shirley :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: only 2 scores not posted for Q3   so we don't know if  1 seed Diamond has overcome its halftime deficit of 45|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously that's the first pickup for Robinson that is NOT double-digit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: ACBL never provides live scores  and usually bridgewinners is better at posting session scores than ACBL|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to open 1@C and rebid 1NT, shaving off a point.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Here we go. Now we are live.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hi All.|pg||
nt|joest: thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: hi|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bjr henri|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mildred says "I guess the commentators are talking about what I should open"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: this hand will test how low the Meckwellopeing bid requirement go|pg||
nt|roswolf: another trappy hand for e/w|pg||
mb|2D|an|D and major|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting play of top @D from dummy   -   i wish i could think of that type of psychological play  before it is made at the table|pg||
nt|joest: over a 3@h opener Pettis might take action, I guess with double if you feel like you got out of bed on the right side|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler might just pass seeing if a   is available at these colors|pg||
nt|psyck: u can tell her she was right|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: baby psyche|pg||
nt|ady: another that looks like a part score    though possible for e/w to get overboard|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d presumably @d and a major|pg||
nt|peachy: Tell her, there was no discussion, her choice I trust better than mine or CK's any day :)  However, I agreed with it, not that it is worth a lot|pg||
mb|2H|an|pass or correct|nt|joest: Gary is also a BIG fan of the 'blue card' or at least he was in his younger days|pg||
nt|joest: this is cold|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: looks like 2 lots of transfers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL probably 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but removing to 5@c isn't that cheap|pg||
nt|santyclz: Strange bidding at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D = @Hs|pg||
nt|roswolf: brushed aside but.......|pg||
nt|bessi2: Molberg decided to take the bull by the horns.. not unreasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra2: support X, XX likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  So I would be cradle robbing :)|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H = @Ss|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice and safe|pg||
nt|ady: should be down 1|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1@s by north wasn't a psych.. I am pretty sure they play transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: well no alert shown and it is in the "normal"pysching position|pg||
nt|rodal f: As well as 2@C is a good lift somewhere|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bigtrain: beth isn't timid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond results posted now -- trailing by 31 with 16 to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampton :  "bless you"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Easy hand: Win, draw trump and claim 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chorush: 500|pg||
nt|leo lasota: -500 is still much friendlier than 4h redbled making.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that lead worked out well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Boyd opened South hand 3@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d1 now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: if n/s play precision which is popular in tceland the 1nt will be 13-15|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chorush: Meckwell can take first 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- are you a 1@S or 1N bidder over 1@H?|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to Henry Bether (USA)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
nt|kit: 6 top tricks, but hard to see where  7 will come from|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save after all :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McGarry never did get to show his extras|pg||
nt|peachy: *Bethe, sorry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
nt|kit: I always bypass 4-card spade suit -- can get it back if partner is strong, and makes bidding much easier when partner knows I'm unbalanced for the 1@S rebid.|pg||
nt|roswolf: the operator confirms 1@S was alerted as a transfer|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||
nt|kit: normal style here -- count over attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: North does not know that South hasn't the @HQ.|pg||
nt|kit: obviously North can never find the play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: always bypass when balanced, that is.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: declarer needs a lot of luck which is not there    needs to play soth of Ace doubleton spade  and play for K10 hearts onsside|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: you can keep an eye on the other table via  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|daman: nice play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless we were wrong about RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman's 2N  22-23   with stronger balanced hand he would bid 2@H [Kokish -- although that new member of ACBL Hall of Fame says that is NOT the name of the convention]|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for Meckstroth to find diamond shift|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|chorush: I don't believe in being crtical of opening leads in general but I really think a trump was called for here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: and it all went as predicted -- 12 IMPs to Robinson|pg||
nt|joest: i agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes careful defence|pg||
nt|chorush: Great lead by Clerkin. Hamman woul dhave made with any other|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|larrymori: cash out for down 1 would be 3 imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case why did east not use some science eg 2@C ucb|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like UDCA & Smith signals for EW|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible [without logon] via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond on third club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|leo lasota: especially when you have all the aces|pg||
nt|bessi2: good question.. that 4@s seems too much to me|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|leo lasota: yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Rodwell pretty much has to pitch a diamond I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a big clubber -- support X/XX in 2/1 confuses me    i would have thought that Dennis M would bid over 2@D with 2@S [or 3@C] to clarify 3@S & extras|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: so what do I know?|pg||
nt|joest: and I'm sure in retrospect Cohler will too|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but on trump lead he can still get out d1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: I don't see much difference between a heart or a club lead. The swing was mainly due to luck.|pg||
nt|larrymori: Cole shifted to a @d in the same position to earn 200|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|joest: yes, even in 'duplicate' there is luck|pg||
nt|kit: I see a lot of difference -- 12 IMPs difference, to be exact|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually bad luck, I have found.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now claim?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|joest: starting diamonds is tough|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Boyd stole the hand in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East was shut out of the bidding|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: now defense has to be careful|pg||
nt|larrymori: all true|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell should work out the club shift I think|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bessi2: but these icelanders and scandinavians all bid like maniacs so I'm not altogether surprised :)|pg||

nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: if the auction times out in such a fashion that Robinson gets to show his @Ds|pg||
nt|chorush: that;s true|pg||
nt|leo lasota: win king clubs, ruff heart, club to 9 ruff heart diamond up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low diamond lead was best dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I should know never to lead your suit."|pg||
nt|ady: no mistake from defenders|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1@s and a 3@s overcall on the way i suspect|pg||
nt|ady: again no game   but I have a feeling this may get high|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could go anywhere depending on the maniacs valuation of the hands:)|pg||
nt|peachy: EW System Summary does not mention Smith|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3/4@S now!?|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT = Jacoby|pg||
nt|bessi2: ohh.. west is dealer.. I must be seeing things|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: MAYBE A FULL BLOODED 3@s|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like this bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) reindeer meat must be common for breakfast|pg||
nt|roswolf: for nervous american spectators this id european bidding at its best/worst|pg||
nt|bessi2: I wonder what a bid other than 2@d would have meant|pg||
nt|ady: west can only make the 9 tricks he is looking at|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like a straightforward pass to me at this juncture|pg||
nt|roswolf: terje will act sanely|pg||
nt|roswolf: terje aa|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder what Hampton is thinking about|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: Probably responsive double by Rodwell here|pg||
nt|joest: Berk might have a problem if declarer plays low but Pettis might play Cohler for KQ98 I suppose|pg||
nt|joest: still if declarer has A10 he has two tricks coming|pg||
nt|peachy: kibs ask where they are playing.  In Toronto, canada. This is from the ACBL Summer Nationals|pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the nice things about having Meckwell at the other table is that you usually get score comparisons.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: double must show a singleton @S|pg||
nt|bessi2: p-p-dbl-p-4@d-p-4@h-p-5@d seems plausible|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps it was Quinn debating whther to bid 2@c or make a neg. X|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there was a pause as a kibitzer moved from one side of the table to another and everyone waited|pg||
nt|psyck: E will have to paly a low @c to test declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  West will lead a club|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: are screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  must be playing close to original Precision    CC Wei's version used 2N = 22-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: yes but no so early in the competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H is imaginative|pg||
nt|bessi2: I am guessing east could have bid a positive 2@h earlier instead of 2@d and is therefore not shy about introducing this horrible suit|pg||
nt|bessi2: and if that is the case.. Aa will probably remove to 5@d|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome jon sveindal |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Meck might bid 2@H -- not sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: no screens in use today maybe in later segments|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi from Toronto:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  test is whether N-S can find X|pg||
nt|psyck: two commentators comments were enough for the curse to materialize|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: an axe!?|pg||
nt|psyck: this should take care of the @@h loser|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Hello Jon|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so you are there!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice pressure by NS.  I don't see a way to make this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: looks like a zugzwang position|pg||
nt|ritong: zugzwang is a chess term, meaning that you have to play and any choice is bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Palmer is certainly deliberate in her pace of play.|pg||
nt|ritong: say east leads a @h, three rounds of trumps, then good @d guess|pg||
nt|ritong: and east is cooked|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR rates roddy's hand as 17.40|pg||
nt|henryb:  North might lead a @d????????|pg||
nt|daman: strip the @Cs   draw trumps and play a @S?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think it is the Royal York Hotel |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: @D is the classic frozen suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I think it is cold now|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: probably queen of diamonds played by Robinson at trick 1|pg||
nt|ritong: seeing that coming, palmer prefers to make it short|pg||
nt|othered1: with that lead, south may get endplayed when @S is lead.  Opening @S lead would have beaten it\|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup that looks right|pg||
nt|daman: Sontag is one of the fastest declarers in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Italian Blue Team had a lot of success from late 50s thru early 70s with balanced hand takeout doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @D6 at trick 2 is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this way Hamman knew to duck and now gets to see discard from Zia|pg||
nt|psyck: not that it matters much w/o an X|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry about that.|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like most routes lead to down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    a cool tool to see how small changes can affect value of a hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that said -- exactly the same start in other room against 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth executed a swindle to make 3N|pg||
nt|henryb:  Meanwhile the other room is headed for what I think is the standard result: 790 in 4@sX|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bessi2: fairly normal result I should think|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room"|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: upside-down signals by E-@@|pg||
nt|kit: E-W|pg||
nt|ady: case for south to double 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're starting to see more of those again, especially over 1@C|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: in my room at the Royal - easier to kibbitz when you see all the hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Kit's line looks better than a club to the ace.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: a lot would depend on what west pitched on the spade jack too|pg||
nt|kit: maybe not -- East have had stiff king|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he was interested to find East with a single @CK.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  Classic comment by S: "If I had bid @c would you have led a @s?"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: but baldursson-jonsson play strong club and are much better equipped to stay lower on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this is event (many years ago) I won all of my gold points for LM |pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: that should level the scores|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd leads count card back, so Robinson knows Boyd has 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: tah day|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah*|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: will have to finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: which may lead to down 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd should be able to work out from this line of play that declarer has bid a 3-bagger.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: in Toronto that is |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: Declarer will simply take heart finesse and go down 1 -- noth much else left|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Still not clear how to defend -- he doesnt' know about club spots|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: This cover is not a good play I don't think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because West has a diamond entry|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson can still survive, but now it is trickier|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not at all easy to find, but this would have been d2 if berk had led heart through and cohler plays 3rd heart after cashing last spade|pg||
nt|peachy: Al, perhaps the reason for re-emergence is that openings have become lighter|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: In fact, what happens if spector cashes a club now?|pg||

nt|kit: Robinson has to dump jack of diamonds|pg||

nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: now the club shift -- good defense by Robinson|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: Boyd is dead if Meck has A10x of clubs so I think he has to assume he doesn't have that|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: so maybe he should have shifted to jack of clubs to clarify position|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think they'll back into the 44 @S fit|pg||

nt|bigtrain: XX doesn't show @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = better raise than 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And why not. Must be better to show at least nine of your cards rather than six|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I like 2@S only.|pg||

nt|henryb:  Shawn is well within her means|pg||
nt|psyck: If playing sound preempts 1st seat, W could do more, but maybe it could be undisciplined for them at this vul, still, W should have enquired|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: i like 2@s as well notwithstanding this result|pg||
nt|kit: true -- if it definitely showed clubs -- but most pairs play at least semi-forcing NT|pg||

pc|cA|nt|brolucius: When East leads one red ace, declarer will assume that he must hold the other red ace too. Not that this info is particularly useful.|pg||

nt|ritong: on the art to plunge opponents in the soup|pg||

nt|ritong: you might get one or two broken bones|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thid hand needs one of my Toronto opponent's favorite plays: the "intra-finesse"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: You could be cold for 5@C, and even 6, while playing the hand in 2@S. North has a two-suited hand with spades and clubs, not a one-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|kit: Not 100% valid inference about the other ace -- East might prefer to lead ace-doubleton rather than from some broken diamond suit|pg||
nt|chorush: the hands fit splendidly and the lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denied a 5-card suit, so 3@S was exactly 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually this concept of transfer raises came after i raised eric on Kx at the paducah regional in the mid-80s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it right?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he liked the idea of Hx raises with some hands but still wanted a "normal" raise available|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Meckwell have already won a National Event at this tourney as part of the Spector Team that won the GNT [Grand National Teams]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H was a weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: It's important to have agreements here. Most, I think, play 3H as the weakest hand while pass is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler alerted the pass.  Berk did not.|pg||

nt|larrymori: tough call, misfits shud stay low|pg||
nt|kit: Very good decision.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: Meckwell total for National championships is over 100 (unless I am wrong)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: in the other room   P-1@S//2@D-2@H//2N-3@H//P|pg||
nt|kit: AJxx an ugly suit to lead from, and gets the usual result.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so EW must play 2-way Drury|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will try to slide the 9 of hearts through -- he doesn't want it to get covered.|pg||
nt|chorush: The friendly hearts should let this one home|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks about minimum openings.  Boyd: "We aren't shy about 11 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: hands."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Interesting play problem here for cohler in 3 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: for berk that is :)|pg||
nt|chorush: The hand lies very favorably for NS but it will still be no picnic to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who wonder what is meant by Maximal DBL   Palmer's situation was one where it would apply   3@S is just competitive [non-invite] and DBL with no room would have been the ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ONLY way to invite game|pg||
nt|chick: 8 HCP seems invitational values, why sign off in a 4-3 fit at the 2 level?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: If Meckstroth does cover, and he should, the Robinson has a problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 4 the americans ventur to 5@S cost -300|pg||

nt|henryb:  so it was a big swing - 17 imps - to misguess the @s position|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a good day today:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H shows the EW philosophy -- if opener holds 6+ or unbalanced, then bid again|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: 2 of diamonds upside-down count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "A lot of junk." as he lays down dummy.|pg||

nt|chorush: Good play by Landenm makes life tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually al, they may play both X and pass as different game tries since 3@C forced them to 3@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: I don't think Robinson will be ducking any hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no reason to expect such good hearts, for a NV weak two-bid. So, he tries 3NT in the hope that South has something like @SJ-x or at least @S10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
nt|roswolf: some specs are surprised that west didnr open 1@D 3rd in hand - they must have had red meat for lunch|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: I am really surprised about what happened in the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has the problem of being locked out of both hands.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bessi2: 8hcp vs 14-16 is barely invitational values.. my guess is that he was going to invite game if the response had been 2M.. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: 3NT should only be 'very wrong' when partner has mis-bid. South has just about what he has shown with regard to supporting a 3NT contract.|pg||
nt|henryb:  with 5 you can comfortably bid 2@d and bid more later. It is when you want to seriously offer your suit as an alternative trump suit (or source of tricks) that you want to break the chain|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Becker should cash the third diamond before playing on clubs, so defense won't have a diamond exit -- but not many players think of this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Some discussion confirming that the first @d play by Boyd was USDC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kit is correct, but it will not help declarer here when West has A10xx in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: it may help for damage control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Berkowitz response to 1@S was 3@S   Cohler bid 4@S and NS were never in the auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: good play - will make now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: you must be right about the 14-16 then|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: but in that case, why not pass 2@D?|pg||
nt|bessi2: That is good question,  I was wondering that myself|pg||
nt|ady: finesse will bring this home|pg||
nt|roswolf: goodto be lucky then|pg||
nt|bessi2: specs suggest he didn't want to end up in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose there is an argument that N could have 3325 distrib and must have a 3 card major|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: just play winners then  and lose 2 spades and 2 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would probably have passed 1N myself|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chorush: yes, but the opponents will have to reconnect him for trick 8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell shows his cards and asks about the finesse.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: Boyd has to be enjoying the way things have gone|pg||
nt|kit: Actually I don't think Robinson should have repeated the finesse -- Surely Meckstroth would have covered from Qxxx, and Rodwell might have ducked his queen.|pg||
nt|chorush: I agree with that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry -- lost the play.|pg||
nt|chorush: When the 8 appeared on round 2 finessing again was not indicated|pg||
nt|othered1: mkaybe the wrong vulnerability for the "automatic" 3rd seat 1@D in Precision?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah sane fellow|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course difficult to find the ruff|pg||

nt|chorush: Think declarer has to finish down 1 now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unfortunately for berkowitz, he cannot setup a diamond discard AND take a club finesse.  However, he may work this out and ruff out diamond, play ace  club ruff club.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice score|pg||

nt|brolucius: Some players would have opened 3@H on South's sequence of heart honors. In that case it would be very clear for North to prefer 4@H to 3NT.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: as bigtrain put it last set   "billions served"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NON-Invite  with @C & @D :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this convention is used because 1@D could be 2@D & 5@C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chorush: on a bad day it could be 2 diamonds and 3 clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: 2@H overcall in other room -- more effective|pg||
nt|joest: yes it pinpointed the sixth heart and permitted south to compete to the three level|pg||
nt|brolucius: It must be East thinking - wondering how high to go on the 'double fit'.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not without risk, as partner is passed and LHO is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The suit is not exactly solid|pg||
nt|kit: it is simply a better hand description.  Sure, once in a while it might go for a number, but sometimes it is even safer to bid at the higher level immediately.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17   [3rd seat vul and 4th seat]|pg||
nt|chorush: 40 Jacks is even particularly great in pinochle|pg||
nt|ritong: actually palmer took a considerable risk|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X = 6-7 many distributions|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d transfer and 1@h shows 11-13 bal I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: isnt|pg||
nt|kit: sensible lead -- heart or club lead figures to cost more than to gain.|pg||
mb|2S|an|5 spades, invitatn, distributional|nt|leo lasota: Interesting decision for cohler whether to rebid 2s here.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room   1N-2@C//2@D-end|pg||
nt|ritong: winning 4 imps when it is right in the end, but risking the dreaded double game swing|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm i am getting bad vibes here|pg||
nt|bessi2: 3@s transfer to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  by south |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, but if you say that you play weak-jumps vulnerable, you have to bid on that hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok misplaced if north passes|pg||
nt|chorush: someone is going to play 4 spades but it isn't Jerry Clerkin|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: It looks like the do something intelligent double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Normally with balanced hands and 5 card majors, you just pass 1nt with 9 or 10 points, hoping that partner will be able to win enough tricks on power.|pg||
nt|chorush: Personally, I would have bid 2 spades with the south hand but i am a big fan of raising on 3 with reasonable hands|pg||
nt|leo lasota: However, with a small doubleton AND Ax in another suit, I think 2S is the winning call.|pg||
nt|chorush: Brek may have lost his best chance to make this when he didnt put up the queen. Not that he should as a normal rule but the rest of the hand lies atrociously for his side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen giving this play a really good think....|pg||
nt|joest: well third hand high saves the day|pg||
nt|joest: if he plays low Berk has seven tricks right now|pg||
nt|chorush: If he plays low Berkowitz will happily take +90. If he plays the 10 I think Berk will return the 9 giving EW a chance to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: which costs a tad more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rewind|pg||
nt|santyclz: Errrr.  Undo.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|psyck: after stayman sequence, bidding 2@s shows an invitational hand, some play as 5+ & a few as 4+|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  Is there any sensible way to reach the good 6@d?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Few pre-empts are without risk, but that doesn't stop them from being effective, of course.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: So they did survive it, but South had to make a good guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding was well judged around the table.|pg||
nt|kit: defense in trouble now -- club shift difficult to find, and probably too late anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now rodwell has entry to dummy for misguess in @H|pg||
nt|ady: best lead a diamond from west   but still south can get 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=artificial game force|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many play this auction is 4@s and the values for 2N|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|bessi2: easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Meck held 5@S & 4/5@H  he would have responded with 1@D-2@H[weak]  or -2@S[invite]|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  With 5@s they start with a transfer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Rodwell knows spades splitting, so setting that up first|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s plays lots of transfers over an opening 1@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: Hamman going to guess spades here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Boyd will probably punt with another diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: Contract will hinge on heart guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd jumps into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will likely misguess hearts due to Boyd's original pass -- provided Boyd defends passively|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest: the 3 should be suit preference for clubs |pg||
nt|ahollan1: someday  i hope bbo comes up with a software solution to the most common bidding error from operator -- missing a PASS|pg||
nt|chorush: Zia I mean|pg||
nt|santyclz: Zia might too.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|peachy: In the last hand, Arnim-von Auken reached the best contract 6D, after strong club opening|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: if Robinson can conceal his AK of clubs, declarer might misjudge the strength and play him for queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: having to UNDO multiple times is brutal|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|joest: then again maybe not|pg||
nt|kit: well, so much for that idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was good for a few seconds!|pg||
nt|kit: Becker knows Robinson would never be leading a heart from queen, so he should go up ace in case Boyd has stiff queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will of course also be broadcasting from the Spingold (and Wagar, women), starting on Wednesday with the Round of 32 in the Spingold|pg||
nt|kit: Admittedly difficult to construct a consistent distribution where Boyd has a stiff hearts, though|pg||
nt|brolucius: And East would have had to lead 3rd best from 4. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room, Becker led @H|pg||
nt|bessi2: just maybe cause for a swing if the open room south passes his 11 count and north opens 1N... though I dont know why south would pass|pg||
nt|jbgood: safe for 9 - likely a push|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: to be more precise, i should have said, some play it as 5, some as 4, & some as either 4 or 5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|kit: Now the defense pretty much can't get it wrong|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO all the evidence pointed to getting hearts wrong. I would have|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will get the heart count from his partner on 2nd round of hearts, so he will know not to duck.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|leo lasota: he may actually make 2 here with pettis pitching a spade.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|kit: Robinson makes it easy for the defense.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd must know the whole hand now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is anyone else surprised that Rodwell   a) bid 2@C opposite known 17-18   and/or b) rebid 2N instead of PASS 2@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Spector 1st seat PASS |pg||
nt|chorush: How many clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: 4 looks right to me|pg||

nt|psyck: 2N ? :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra2: that was just the bid Rod wanted to hear |pg||
nt|psyck: common to open NT with single A/K to solve rebid problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And it might be a good save, as it was in other room|pg||
nt|joest: then again there is always that fear of pushing them into a making slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker asks about the double.|pg||
nt|joest: but yes you gotta remove this|pg||
nt|kit: Double shows extra offense and defense, but still seems clear for Robinson to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: right you were|pg||
nt|kit: And Rodwell will take a possibly good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: good prediction|pg||
nt|roswolf: expensive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that Rodwell did NOT use the 3@C bid -- maybe that was the 1 imp difference  Jerry gave away distributional info|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Yes, he is subtracting from his partner's defense.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C wasn't surprising...  2NT shocked me speechless|pg||

nt|joest: we'll see if RKCB is 4@s or 4N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S10 is rusinow...  may have a higher honor|pg||
nt|peachy: Here, a bit strong for 2NT rebid, and wrong shape for reverse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: He will claim later that it is an obvious Lightner Double.|pg||
nt|bessi2: I wonder what 2@s means.. looked like a dbl to me|pg||
nt|psyck: funny, this is 20.00 KnR points, do not recoolect even entering a hand which out put the KnR count exactly same as HCP before|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: He'll find a 7th trick here.  The @C10 is placed well for declarer in that EW can't threaten to run th esuit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: suggests a shortage as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: north wont pass i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Spector pretty much has to double I would think -- and can becker find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If anyone wants an illustration of the intrafinesse, go to the other room and run the movie of board 5|pg||
nt|jbgood: and cards are friendly for NT...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW agreement is that they get to choose the minor when 4@C & 4@D  --  if that trivia is useful to anyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boyd will be disappointed to learn that he has lost IMPs.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Funny way to gain/lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector sighs and shakes his head when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|joest: cheaper to take the save in 6@h :) -- which makes on a club lead|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson has to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: Best kind of save is a make|pg||
nt|joest: two without?|pg||
nt|peachy: Check it out yourself at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi  K & R hand evaluator|pg||
nt|henryb:  I don't believe that is what rebidding 3N shows|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Quinn asks for a review|pg||
nt|henryb:  If the @hAK were @d, it would be closer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: A lead I think is pretty obvious looking at his hand, but he thought otherwise.|pg||
nt|kit: Partner opened 1@D, he has majors bottled up -- where does declarer get tricks but trumps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set they had an even better sacrifice  6@CX making|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he could counter a trum by starting spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Jeff still has that nice surprise to find out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: routine down 1 |pg||
nt|roswolf: apparently 2@s was asking for stopper|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: chances are declarer will try to steal a trick before revealing his @ds|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chorush: Only a trump lead keeps the contract from immediately being made, and I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|joest: low club gives it up at once|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That's what North bid.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: well there's always the @CQ ira|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well he avoided @S at tricks 1 & 2|pg||
nt|jbgood: friendly as far as the heart suit goes - a spade would have been deadly - in first or second trick..|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i guess it takes @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jerry again bid more than Rodwell    the other room is 4@S West|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: as does 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italian Blue Team Rule:  Double and lead trump|pg||
nt|chorush: sorry Jack:) I did neglect that one|pg||
nt|ritong: although, @c K(x) onside and he s home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [he'll correct me if i'm wrong]  Rusinow = 2nd of touching honors   so when Walter says higher honor that means a non-touching sequence of  AJT or KJT   not QJT, which would lead ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack|pg||
nt|peachy: In many styles, 3NT rebid by opener is somewhat conventional, for example running suit in opening minor|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chorush: but anyone finding that lead should be watched. Carefully|pg||
nt|henryb:  or opened major for that matter|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|ady: what about a heart stopper?|pg||
nt|peachy: S might have chosen an aggressive lead, he can see the danger in the heart suit, holding xxx|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, matter of agreements|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: hmm lost in translation i think|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would rather open 2N with the S hand|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: berk: "Why didn't you show the queen?"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: You can only wonder if berk was holding his breath when he saw the ace diamonds hit the table.  Fortunately, Cohler had him covered.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: good question!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I did -- wait a minute -- oh..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Short break at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: What I think happened is that Cohler is used to playing 4S as rkc and over that 5H would show 2 with the Q. Just a guess. Berkowitz and Cohler are not regular partners|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe you are correct Ira.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 14 imp difference is a very close match.  Hopefully, we will have some more interesting hands come up.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Everyone is grabbing a glss of water.  Restarting in a few seconds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Here we go.|pg||

nt|kit: This one is a legitimately dull deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Becker has stolen Spector's spades from before|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer does not usually put two exciting deals back-to-back, in case someone has forgotten to take their heart pills.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: At least it isn't a dull 1NT.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well stated al|pg||
nt|ady: no doubt east will open 1@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems straightforward|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will save them for later|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to add the word 'dull' to '1NT' That is taken for granted.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After David leaves|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5-10 HCP, 5-7@S|pg||
nt|kit: now many spades?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe i can hire you to edit my commentary|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C, 10-15|pg||
nt|ritong: also, when south discards on the third @s, he has his contract with @h Ace with south, so simply went for that|pg||
nt|ady: will south take action?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 7@S very unlikely at these colors|pg||
nt|roswolf: double|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: this looks like a straightforward natural game invitation|pg||
nt|joest: which I like better than the 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: It really is not a very good holding with J9xxx, but I would probably bid 1h with landen's hand.|pg||
nt|chorush: Hand is close to being worth 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: East sensibly doesn't act, at t his vul, on that weak 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ady: double from north?|pg||
nt|roswolf: another double!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  or  17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt seems odd but no doubt systemic|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough to make a game on N-S cards, but also tough to avoid bidding one|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: vul  7@S is common|pg||
nt|joest: some would respond 1@s as south, playing a "Walsh" type system|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D asks for description|pg||
nt|ady: 3 level precarious|pg||
nt|peachy: NS could headed too high here, though 4H can make with heart guess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chorush: Both sides are officially now too high but Berk is going to bid 5D|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 2nt showing 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure Jack; hearts might be dead and buried after 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: that's the risk you run for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was going to say that anything other than a 4@S rebid would be bizarre.|pg||
nt|kit: I think Boyd should double -- provided double is primarily penalties as I think it should be.|pg||
nt|larrymori: this is a big steal of vul game|pg||
nt|chorush: Very big theft|pg||
nt|chorush: grand larceny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  24  the other room   P-1@C-DBL-3@C//DBL-5@C-P-P//5@D-DBL-end|pg||
nt|larrymori: question of system, if X is 3 suited takeout and 4nt is 2 suited takeout he has to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he does |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL probably @H & @S  [Mathe] over 1@C or 1@C-1@D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks fairly obvious to attack @C entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: you are also endplayed after 1NT if partner bids 2C or 2S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 3@D over 2@C show this type?|pg||
nt|joest: it does if you agree so :)  I have seen folks play that fit-showing as well|pg||
nt|kit: spector considering making this not such a dull deal after all|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what 3@h was|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very thoughtful of him to consider the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|joest: but it appears Spector treated as natural|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a shot to get to 3NT if partner bids it, planning on signing off at 4@S otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Unfortunately, I cannot read the notes from here.|pg||
nt|joest: the fact that he is still thinking however is threatening to 'undull' this deal :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The Commentators' Curse strikes again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did think about 3@H as a no-trump problem, but it seems a bit risky. 4@S is the world's safest rebid.|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||
nt|brolucius: no-trump probe..|pg||
nt|kit: 4 of a previously bid major is to play.  Period.  End of story.  A very good agreement all partnerships should have.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: was going to be an artificial response but after the X the responses are natural|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 4@c is not superclear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, always a @h loser|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, indeed, I forgot to check the spots|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: potential double fit; favorable vulnerability.  5@d seems auto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I hope you can take a joke."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is not a hand that favors the law of total tricks.  E/W can be held to 3 hearts, N/S can be held to 3 diamonds.|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks Henry and kibs:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am afraid I must leave you. Duty elsewhere calls|pg||
nt|psyck: if opps promise to lead @c, NS would have prefered to be in 3N|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That was a lot of thinking for a pass.|pg||
nt|joest: and if the club king were onside we'd be asking why he didn't bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Interestingly, the Walsh approach would have led to a bit slower auctionand NS might never have found diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, pard bid 3@d voluntarily|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT suggests cjoice of minors I would think|pg||
nt|ady: choice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: with hearts breaking (again) 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, they get to 4@S. No harm in entertaining us a bit along the way.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, no swing -- but at least it wasn't dull for the specs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: well defence have a blueprint of this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sontag says the double shows diamoonds, at least "I think so" -- Berk:  no low level doubles are penalty; try to remember that|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not help them of course:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Landen is taking it all a bit seriously at the other table, rebidding 4@S.|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will likely shift to a trump here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Hoping declarer has 3 clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dennis' 4@H not everyone's choice -- but  at this vulnerability don't want to make it easy for opponents|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly a vlaid point, but you could keep making his hand better with the same distribution til he had to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that doesn't sound right Larry -- a) equal level conversion may apply [so 5@C-5@D]  b) DBL gets left in a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and c)  meckwell are notorious crooks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: But they are very pleasant about it at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: Bridge-wise, if you reach into you rpocket to get your wallet you may shake hands with one of them|pg||
nt|larrymori: I do not know their agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd asks about the style of weak two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at favorable -- implies 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "A wide variey of hands."|pg||
nt|ady: may get heart position wrong|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|larrymori: he did not want to ask earlier revealing strength, so pass or X had to be fairly quick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: This is reasonable also|pg||
nt|ritong: so, expecting @d Hxxxx and an other feature is not overoptimistic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bill Cole's @S holding looks bad on this auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: thx Henry|pg||
nt|psyck: no|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: also has to negotiate diamonds|pg||
nt|bessi2: this requires some nice guesswork|pg||
nt|roswolf: or superb card-reading:)|pg||
nt|ady: would rather defend 2@S  than try for 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not encouraging for the americans that exchange|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, private|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 3N shows how East hand gets so much better after @D raise -- and @H stopper??  well sometimes partner has Qxx or they break 44|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: good evening everyone|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: which might help them to make 4@c, so..|pg||
nt|ritong: well it s easier from upthere|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Playing 'ace for attitude, king for count' leads, East would start with the @CK and discover that West had an odd number of clubs, clearly five on this bidding. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: making 3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: north is only in 3.  In game, would have taken a double-dummy view to  make after @D shift|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: how would he know to start with the king here?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: apparently N asking about range of 2 spade bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you weren't at my table for 1st Quarter   Meckwell trying to win this event for 8th time, their teammates either for 2nd or 3rd win|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Knowing about the queen might be most important|pg||
nt|chorush: nice play. Boyd getting ready to claim|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are unlikely to score three club tricks then.|pg||
nt|kit: right -- but he has 4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Perhaps Berk can send this hand to Larry Cohen.  N/S have 10 card fit yet they make only 9 tricks; E?W had 11 card fit yet they only take 9 tricks as well.  :)|pg||
nt|chorush: 21 trumps, 18 tricks IS unusual, but its not the worst I have seen The LAW do|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Very true Ira|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It seems to me that Rodwell gets more than his fair share of "guesses" correctly.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hiya Walter|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Walter welcome |pg||
nt|jbgood: brave gyus dont need a stopper to bid 3 NT |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is on short break, so we'll have to wait to see what happens there|pg||
nt|peachy: I have no doubt that game will also bid at other table in Bd9 so we should expect a pish|pg||
nt|peachy: *push, sry for my typo|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Some players lead the ace from 4, others the king. Both sets swear that their method is easily best.|pg||
nt|joest: I've never been sure when to lead the ace vs. the king in that system.  Maybe David can explain it.  He's written a book that covers it!|pg||
nt|kit: Good result for N-S in other room -- might not be duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Rodwell can, if he wishes, jump to 4H intheir system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24, 5@DX went down 2   i thought it had play for down 1, but still 6 imps for Spector|pg||
nt|joest: North-South rate to zoom to a spade game here and wrap it up|pg||
nt|othered1: a 20-20 hand and 1N seems normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt by e/w might be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Meck was unable to support diamonds after a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: A very nice result for them.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which made life easier for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both the DC and Florida districts have done very well in this event -- but Chip Martel and Northern California have best win record|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w get to 3NT may need to negotiate the diamonds for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra2: what was line "we dont need no stinkin' (guns) stoppers |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4-4 makes my bid look good  Meck|pg||
nt|sybarra2: oh it was badges |pg||
nt|sybarra2: duh |pg||
nt|bigtrain: stoppers are for children...  give me alittle length and i'm happy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S goes down with @D ruff  so  no predictions about the imp swing from me|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR @H|pg||
nt|chorush: getting conservative as he gets older|pg||
nt|kit: he has seen his partner's minimum opening bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was supposed to show 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|chorush: most experts play 2H as a constructive raise here|pg||
nt|bessi2: probably a systematic way for west to show his M's shape on the way to 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s may make here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfc: Thumbs down on the spade raise from both sides of the screen.|pg||
nt|joest: well if that's so that is what I would bid with this hand b/c 2@s is reserved for horrible hands|pg||
nt|chorush: If NS do, the Cohler doesn't think his hand is constructive. I disagree|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Cohler has tough decision whether to show constructuve values or not; an ace and a king are very promising, but 34333 shape is not.|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect he showed nonconstructive or we would not be waiting for Berk's bid|pg||
nt|joest: well I play 2@h as constructive and believe me I would bid 2@s on so much less than this I couldn't afford to take the chance with 2@s|pg||
nt|chorush: I'm definitely with you Jack. 2S could be a 4-3-3-3 3count|pg||
nt|joest: "constructive" does not mean "limit raise"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I agree with both of you, the constructive 2h raise would be my choice as well.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a bold bid by north|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D north?|pg||
nt|bessi2: this is missing a pass or 2|pg||
nt|psyck: slim values, but they may be pushed to it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = game force, 5+@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ugly with all your values in your short suits.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: and the 2@D raise makes North's 2@H call more competitive rather than constructive|pg||
nt|chorush: no, it just means a hand that if you compete with 3 spades later you wont be finding a Yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lee Trevino [and others]     The more I practice, the luckier I get|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup north was not that bold|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but you knew the line I was thinking of |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: so much so that Meck has a maximum|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will have a second chance to lead his singleton club if he misses the first time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "Might only have three."|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately larry cohen is not in the audience anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I guess there is a good reason he is playing and I'm doing the Vugraph. :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he is always sad when people are allowed to play 2@h peacefully|pg||
nt|ritong: even playing imps, even vulnerable|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: But he might not know what to play for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: max = any 6 or shape :)|pg||
nt|kit: However, this ends it quickly|pg||

nt|brolucius: Both Souths did well to raise the hearts on their moderate hand. Obviously the right move. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: berk "I denied 4 spades"|pg||
nt|ady: some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|roswolf: final contract is 5@D|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will make this I believe|pg||
nt|ady: also can make |pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Provided robinson reads the lead as a singleton -- he should, since South marked with short spades.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm unusual continuation|pg||
nt|ady: unusual auction|pg||
nt|bessi2: ??? did this really happen.. I don't believe it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't most people play 2@H as a one-round force here? If it isn't, then double|pg||
nt|kit: not clear whether to return a trump or a spade here -- probably spade, playing partner for Kx is best|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 3H was passing the buck|pg||
nt|joest: yeah well I don't like 3H for two reasons|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, sometimes it is worth considering how aggressive your partner's bidding style is.  As we see, Berkowitz still made the aggressive game try so the game is still reached.|pg||
nt|joest:  1: you are torturing partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57   Berkowitz 5@D West|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he will lose a @h to try the @c finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57   Landen held Zia's hand and  3@H-DBL  that shut out Meckstroth  who led @H against 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: But you can't complain about 2 aces responding to a strong @c.|pg||
nt|santyclz: This should be fast.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show the shape -- locate the honors later :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  2: if partner gives you a slow 3@s you have an ethical night mare|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I really like reason  1 just on principle.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: I don't think most people play 2@H forcing|pg||
nt|joest: well I offered two just in case :)|pg||
nt|chorush: exactly Jack. Both very important points. IMO is 2 spades was not constructive, Cohler had the all-time quick 4 spade bid after the 3 club try|pg||
nt|henryb:  Notice that 2@h is only one down. Raise on 3!|pg||
nt|roswolf: DIAMONDS ARE DIFFICULT TO GUESS SURELY|pg||
nt|bigtrain: either would bid 1NT with north so yes they would bid game|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we help from many specs  treasure of sierra madre  |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 5 more options |pg||
nt|peachy: I really dont like this auction|pg||
nt|psyck: even an o/t possible with only 1@s & 1@d loser|pg||
nt|peachy: by EW|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W's actions questionable|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: blazing saddles known for other things|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: I know I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then you have to double|pg||
nt|kit: why?|pg||
nt|kit: if partner passes 2@H I'm probably high enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H constructive, but NF|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding you may want to compete against 2@D with quite a modest hand including fair hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play the same with no interference, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- here 2@H isn't necessarily so construcive|pg||
nt|kit: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: but as I said, here 2@H isn't necessarily constructive.  With no interference, it is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many bridge teachers say 'Change of suit forcing', but I have always thought that this is because it is much easier to teach! |pg||
nt|joest: out of comp, transfer advances can enter the picture (for some pairs) that makes things a bit easier|pg||
nt|psyck: E's bids were normal i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: perhaps S should have done more? 2@s for a good raise? or should N continued? guess that will be one topic after this session|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ady: may not have to guees the diamond position|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, transfers are wonderful but little has been written about them.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sybarra2: aha|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bessi2: this soved it aswell :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: as long as diamonds 3-2 was home at this point|pg||
nt|bessi2: though I do believe declarer should have ducked a @h at trick 1|pg||
nt|bessi2: or maybe not.. am not sure|pg||
nt|ady: movie last hand records 4@D contract?|pg||
nt|bessi2: no.. is entered correctly|pg||

nt|roswolf: score corrected|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: played card|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chorush: better psychology than playing low for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25 Palmer didn't open where Rodwell bid 2@S     Spector in 4@H West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think you're right Jon   McGarry needed to start with 2@S for NS to have any chance  - but even then it isn't automatic to get to 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  40 where Meck played 3N with long @H    Jerry Clerkin started with Big 1@C  and next thing he knew  Hamman in 4@SX|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all players took a short break|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: I don't know exactly what @c meck played from his hand at trick 1, but it could have|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: made a difference to Robinson.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk:  "I was trying to sign-off."|pg||
nt|joest: best is 3NT out of the north|pg||
nt|henryb:  P-P-Multi|pg||
nt|roswolf: another distro hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  [always 1st/2nd & 3rd not-vul]|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Certainly, N/S want to make sure that North declares this 3nt.|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 8 the americans in the other room made 1nt +1 for a solid partscore gain|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: A chance for Spector to tie the match if they can bid and make game -- both of which are big ifs|pg||
nt|brolucius: South missed out on his 2@C rebid, Roland (at the other table).|pg||
nt|kit: club from his hand doesn't make a difference|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO that was already unlikely ipso facto.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had dain bramage    instead of 3@D  McGarry should bid 2N!!!    it took a couple of specs to point out my tunnel vision but mostly   thanks barry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: 2@H = @Ss|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Did Marc Smith not right a book on transfer advances, David, or was it just an article?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: write|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H shows 5 hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|chorush: Well, the law of total tricks got massacred a couple of hands ago. this time it's going to be Goren's "26 HCPs make a game"|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@c = weak balanced or strong; 2@h = 6+ @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   Gerstman opened 1@C in 3rd seat on 58      both pairs for Levine putting on maximum pressure|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h suit, 1N overcall was a possibility|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand was a sad example that if you dont raise the preempt immediately, later raises can lead to trouble|pg||
nt|peachy: Both in that opps could be pushed to game and that opps are given an extra level of bidding to find out if they have anything|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: so, what should South rebid here?  3 possibilities at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: now 3@h/3NT I would think|pg||
nt|ritong: borderline decision for palmer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: He has been asked to write a book on that subject. He writes frequently in Bridge Magazine on the theoretical side of bidding.|pg||
nt|ritong: general strength and shape are not very appealing|pg||
nt|bessi2: it doesn't matter but I don't love this lead|pg||
nt|bessi2: or even like it :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Spector upgraded with the spade fit and got to the game.  Now he has to make it.|pg||
nt|joest: I think Brian SEnior devoted a chapter to it in his book "The Transfer Principle"|pg||
nt|joest: and Jeff Rubens has written about them off and on a while back in The Bridge World|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker takes a bit of a walk as dummy for the first time in this session (I think).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens wrote about them in the Bridge World, April 1981|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's excellent to bid the heart game. 3@H must have been bid on the partial spade fit. Well done.|pg||
nt|joest: wow " a while back" = 30 years.  I should have known.  :(|pg||
nt|kit: How should he play this?  Not clear at all.  Maybe just straight crossruff, which needs only queen of hearts onside or possibly a blockage|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell had to guess how many hearts and/or spades his partner had|pg||
pc|s9|nt|leo lasota: 3 makes, albeit with a litle discomfort when diamonds do not come home for 5 tricks, from the North side.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: smolen sequence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: it appears he guessed wrong as both 2@H and 2@S probably down 1 -- but surely percentage action.|pg||
nt|ritong: but two aces and @cs with pard's opening are plusses|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: And it looks like the blockage works|pg||
nt|chorush: no, the did very well to right-side this although they had no way of knowing what the right side was|pg||
pc|c2|nt|leo lasota: Ax opp Qx "right side" is completely dependent on the holding of the opponent's cards.  Given that, it is still right in the long run to have the hand with Kx in spades playing the ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hand.|pg||
nt|chorush: not auto to duck here|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|joest: could lose to the king and get a spade through when both minors were running all along|pg||
nt|joest: good point|pg||
nt|chorush: this is where you love to have 0 or 2 opening leaders|pg||
nt|joest: indeed you do|pg||
nt|joest: one of my favorite conventions...|pg||
nt|joest: to play against|pg||
nt|chorush: for your opponents I'm sure|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @HK onside -- seems like 6@S has a play     but then i looked at East hand to see @S break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6N is decent too|pg||
pc|cT|nt|joest: will he guess the diamond?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chorush: will play a diamond, then clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota: he should cash one diamond here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: W's 2@h is a weak raise, as 2@d was available for a constructive raise. The cards are well placed here for some o/t's|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 40 - Meck's 1st great 3N  was needed to hold to lose only 3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: A new wrinkle -- the double ruffing finesse when Robinson covers|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chorush: he will|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kit: So now he will make breezing -- very well done|pg||
nt|ady: makes sure of making with clubs 4-2  and spades not 2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 58 -- meckstroth in south actually investigating SLAM -- that should impress the folks who thought they might end up in 3@D|pg||

nt|joest: indeed.  tough play for Robinson.  doubtful spector was going to ride that|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens actually wrote about them in a 6-issue series in 1980-81. It was reprinted as a single monograph. You can buy it from The Bridge World|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 26  Cole stops in 3@H     i think that translates to   we have a new leader|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Spector maybe thought that East would not play the @DQ unless he also held the @DA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is a reasonable assumption.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: so Spector gets their first big size swing and regains the lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|leo lasota: would not surprise me if he guesses correctly here and runs the jack diamonds.|pg||

nt|roswolf: another bits and pieces hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|brolucius: Spector: 'Let me play them in future, will you?'|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: :)|pg||

nt|kit: 6 is upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact I will go downstairs and put the remaining half of yesterday's bottle into the ice box. brb.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does Zia win and play @D -- praying @H3-3  or is there something better? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for instance -- what does Dennis do if Zia ducks this trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then maybe there is late endplay for extra @C trick??|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: And the diamond shift gave declarer  7|pg||
nt|chorush: He will be doing well to make this, after he finds 4 spades in South he is likely to play North for diamond length|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler did well to stay off the diamond lead -- with only one trump|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT+ the 11-13 shapes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: battle of undertricks     sounds like a title for .....  <fill in the blank>|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is good exercise to think about this SINGLE dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: I heard that. It is the rest of the world that is strange. |pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should -- reason Robinson didn't lead heart was likely to be that he had the ace.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Yes, Cohler has hidden from pettis the nature of his distribution.  Unlikely that Pettis expects North to be 1714.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: no bidding; no singleton lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@cs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: I think Pettis will need mirrors to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There are mirrors in the room, but they are too high to see any other hand. :)|pg||
nt|chorush: play could also have been fascinating had Cohler led his diamond, After taking a ruff with the spade 9, he could not return a heart because that would give the trump show away|pg||
nt|daman: 5@D asks for the @S Queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing all 4 hands is actually disadvantage|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Lower?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: but we dont know much about 2H|pg||
nt|chick: A splinter in diamonds would have made it easier for W to decide|pg||

nt|chorush: If that Kx was naywhere else he would pass, but not spades|pg||

nt|santyclz: Uh oh.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = artificial game force  [2-way checkback]|pg||
nt|peachy: luck favors the bold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st DBL (Dennis)  just shows game going values but no clear bid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chorush: unfriendly lie of the cards here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: will take work to just go down one.|pg||
nt|joest: is cohler more likely to underlead the club ace or the QJ?|pg||

nt|leo lasota: very low shot of either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jerry DBL -- hmmmm    takeout??    i'm guessing pass would be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: After that rebid, presumably a solid suit, west with all those winners will drive to slam|pg||
nt|peachy: often, it does, not this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10@S in the other room   [5@SX]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East hand is now great, he wil think, with a singleton in South's suit. He can expect no wastage.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still has to make 3@H on 59 for that to occur|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 or 4 maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: wonder if they would have stuck it out had Spector brought out the hammer :)|pg||

nt|joest: i understand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if it does go 3@D-3@H   then what?|pg||
nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|chorush: I would make whatever my choice of games bid was;|pg||
nt|kit: his 5@C call far from obvious, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: much more likley to be robinson by 3|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s may have egg on their faces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 43  Zia 6@S   but no double and not vul -- so won't affect score much|pg||
nt|santyclz: Overtrick?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs screaming for @S underlead  for @D ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: SQ scoring?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i lost count   AT LEAST 20 of you have talked about the underlead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess   both NT bids were  scrambles - 2 places to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @SA/K lead -- then Jerry needs to play @D for no losers -- on this auction i think that probably means best % is Hamman holding @DQJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which works|pg||
nt|chorush: I hope I don't curse him but I think when he finds Zia with 3 hearts and 3 clubs he will finesse the diamond 9. Zia might deflect him by playing the club 9 on the king of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bruce -- did Zia ask about the NT bids??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told delay is that Zia is asking a lot of questions about the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a difference between playing @D suit for 4 winners and @D suit for NO LOSERS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the mathematicians out there -- which is best play in @D   East singleton quack  or  West  QJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: After the 5nt bid I thought they were going to  end up in @ds.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|larrymori: then 3@s|pg||
nt|larrymori: the other choice was 4@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: but still I wonder :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double might frighten them into a making club contract, from South's point of view.|pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is one of those hands as declarer that you wonder if you think long enough, perhaps I can have the queen of hearts added in to my hand. :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: fortunate that south has the jack of @h so declarer at least has to guess this to make|pg||
nt|ady: need to get heart right to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- now  is there transportation to do both of:  get east's full shape, double hook @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: detected a sigh of relief from Sammy Kehela kibitzing Zia that he didne try underlead;)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand a spec asks what is the correct odds line -anyone care to calculate it?|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I feel north should have bid his hand with 2@d over 1N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Rodwell will have a plan upon seeing dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: I like S aggressive lead, the hearts bid are a danger to let declarer's losers disappear|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops forget they weren't vulnerable so likely robinson by 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: i never argue on decimals:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that lead helps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: n/s have a good save in 5@C  should this make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yesand in view of north's general inactivity may easily go wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did Zia give away the show by leading @SAce??   instead of King|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: On the @H ruff-out line, north needs to hold at least 3@H.  Other lines, I think, require more.|pg||
nt|henryb:  This hand is simple: on a red suit lead you cash 4 red winners and lead a @c to the K|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: If declarer manages to make this, he may shunt the 6@C doubled contract off the front page of the bulletin.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: stiff jack in south seemed more likely than stiff king in north.  I like Boyd's try there|pg||
nt|chorush: Rodwell going to defend this one quickly. Take first 3|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club, two shakes on the top diamonds and down one|pg||
nt|joest: two rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|chorush: He might be considering whether and how he could handle a stiff quack in north|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis still trying to imagine a miracle layout where he may make.  He may ruff club, cash AK diamonds, then play ace and king hearts hoping for QJ tight in the North hand.|pg||
nt|joest: yes. in fairness he is not giving up on making this|pg||
nt|joest: and if he plays a heart up, Cohler will split just to be sure and play will slow down further :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: If South holds honor fourth in trumps and north has the stiff jack or queen, the hand cannot be made if we agree that spades are 42, with south having no more left.|pg||
nt|joest: and Meckwell has matched the contract again|pg||
nt|chorush: for a stiff quack based on what he has seen, North would be 4-1-3-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Pettis apologizes for taking the time....|pg||
nt|chorush: and he can't handle that|pg||
nt|leo lasota: in which case north still has Jx spades and declarer will have one too many losers to avoid|pg||
nt|chorush: so he has to loook for doubleton QJ. that he CAN handle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 60 where Rodwell held 3N to down 1,  Robinson in 3N also, but Puppet Stayman auction concealed his @H length   Cohler led @HQ   now we wait|pg||

nt|joest: = no fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held a doubleton club, the game would be OK.|pg||
nt|joest: defense would have to seriously awry to let this in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even without it hearts could come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|joest: south would need Kx or Kxx of hearts + trumps breaking|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Disaster here for E/W.|pg||
nt|othered1: It depends on how he read the opening lead.  someone with Sontag's table presence, even against good opponents, will get that right most of the time.|pg||
nt|ady: not sure why south took that action   nothing to be ashamed with the overcall   maybe misunderstood the re-double|pg||
nt|ady: dont know whwer e/w were going   2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @SJ = 4th best  |pg||
nt|jbgood: and the opps will start with the first 9 :)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Goren said you were supposed to lead 4th from longest & strongest, right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on sontag's failed slam - lots of interesting comments -ty all specs - the majority feel his line was right|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@HX|pg||
nt|bessi2: I believe the rdbl shows values and doubleton @s and south probably felt he was always competing to 2@s so why not bid it right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: well, if he had overcalled one heart he probably would be defending 3NT in the manner Leo described|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead trumps against doubled partials, except when dummy has just 1 trump :)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure -100 will be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: this is the 'standard' lead off this auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Suppose you pass and West re-opens with a double. You might be worried bidding just 2@S then, with 6 points (albeit ropey ones) and 3-card support.  I prefer to bid straight away ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with a weak hand and then fold up my cards (ahem).|pg||
nt|ritong: good stop|pg||
nt|ritong: but do we make this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we?|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this doesn't make by E, but @h|pg||
nt|warrens:  @h's block if played by W|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, not vulnerable|pg||
nt|ritong: good point W|pg||
nt|bigtrain: personally i'd be satisfied to get to 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks -- i was wondering how to phrase that Walter|pg||
nt|ritong: the " normal" choice here is low @h|pg||
nt|ritong: playing south for H10, twice more likely than KQ|pg||
nt|ritong: but south overcalled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then Palmer has 3 choices --  the normal choice, a fast losing choice and a slow losing choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Declarer still thinking about the hand and then Meck needed to take a quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: break.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Beth -- the middle choice is rarely chosen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room has caught up -- everyone still confused about the result for 60|pg||
nt|ritong: so what do "we" know|pg||
nt|ritong: south overcalled, but was a passed hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: WAIT FOR THE JUICY PENALTY|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: after no club lead, declarer has a real chance.  He plays on hearts, and what does North do?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he showed his hand and right or wrong it seems like Robinson has to double or bid 5@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|kit: There is no right or wrong answer to the question of whether Boyd's pass is forcing.  The important thing is for partnerships to have firm and unambiguous rules, and follow them.|pg||
nt|joest: now there can be some serious damage|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 300 if they take ruffs|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler coudl be afraid he is dealing partner ruffs withnatural trump tricks|pg||
nt|bessi2: difficult for south do dbl 2@h|pg||
nt|bessi2: especially after west bids it showing 5|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT would likely have had a better chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with @DJ onside|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift allows this to make|pg||
nt|kit: so does ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: either a passive heart or underleading the diamond needed|pg||
nt|joest: definitely not easy|pg||
nt|kit: heart exit is okay I think|pg||
nt|kit: and of course low diamond is most successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK certainly looks attractive, though. He will do well to avoid it.|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room south got a diamond raise in (from where?) but here no bidding from south|pg||
nt|kit: Becker would have been better off leading king of clubs on opening lead this time -- of course, on a different day that could cost the contract|pg||
nt|peachy: Pass, direct 3NT, or this sequence all reasonable to me, but I also like Pass. Not vul, and no 5-card suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfc: Play was very quick once Jeff got back.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: would you know for sure in your partnerships if the pass is forcing?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: imo not after the xx which is looking to take a penalty|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: and the swing goes back to Robinson|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I am not surprised by that. The winning defenses were very hard to find and just happened to work, I would say.|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson with only three swings in favor: but all whoppers|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|chorush: Assuming they play unusual v unusal, boyd had a way to show limit or better with spades. Most likely, taking that rougte and bidding 4 spades would be forcing|pg||
nt|joest: of course Pettis isconvinced AJxx of hearts at his right|pg||
nt|chorush: That is a mistaken point of view. No one compelled partner to shift toa diamond if he didnt want to ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis has 5 tricks here if he takes them.|pg||
nt|joest: a point Mr. Berkowitz might make in the post mortem :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: since he knows that south is likely short in diamonds and north is short in clubs, he should cash KQ hearts.  He will be pleasantly surprised for d2.|pg||
nt|joest: next door n-s on track to make 3NT so n-s need a   here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we now have a 21 board match|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: or at least, that may be what Robinson thinks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|larrymori: start with he bid it to make so I do not think pass is an option|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: obviously that is what he thought -- but you can't "think" here -- you must know for sure.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|leo lasota: oh no|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hT|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|joest: well if he cashes the heart ace and the jack doesn't drop he can get the whole club suit run on him|pg||
nt|peachy: With open cards, this contract had no chance, but defense cannot always know as gallery does. Now makes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: I would invite on NT only with quite good 8 points & E's hand does not even appear to be worth 7|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: Soft values are OK in NT, but sourse of tricks would be nice|pg||
nt|psyck: also it is a non vul game, still cannot argue with success|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|leo lasota: not sure why cohler did not exit diamond for berk to ruff since he knows declarer likely has the master trump and p had a small one.|pg||

nt|kit: yes -- 3 double figure swings vs. 0, and match still very close|pg||
nt|chorush: If your partnership has a rule that there are no preempts over preempts, then maybe 4 spades should do the trick|pg||
nt|kit: there must be strict rules which cover this auction (and others)|pg||
nt|joest: yes they did have 800 coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There will be some post-mortems on that one -- on both sides, I think.|pg||
nt|chorush: Incidentally, are their more 1H overcallers than doublers here?|pg||
nt|joest: a very close and exciting match all the way so far|pg||
nt|daman: and now the penultimate board of the first session|pg||
nt|roswolf: a routine 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: if E's hand was same values with xx KQxx xxx QJxx, then it would be clear to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, 17+ bal|pg||
nt|kit: that is my rule -- 4@S not a preempt over a preempt, therefore bid to make voluntarily, therefore in force.  But I'm not guessing.  |pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 1@h i confess|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: As we were all saying.... an excellent raise by East on the first round!|pg||
nt|chorush: I would also|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another discussion to be made with all partnerships is if you play equal level conversion doubles with 4 spades and 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ GF|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 62, Boyd did NOT bid with Meck's hand   will Berkowitz-Cohler find 5@C now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lucky slam here -- they won't get there after this start I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Meck will be more interested if partner has stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does ASK|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's where the ambiguous 1@C can make it tough for north to compete|pg||
nt|henryb:  But why does he want to bid again, Ed?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@S lead and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = limit raise +|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = art GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On this hand, that is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3c alerted|pg||
nt|psyck: the suits are ok with a couple of honors each in them, but no pips...so was borderline|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: What does 6+4+2 come to?|pg||
nt|kit: Should Becker open 1@S or 2@C?  Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|joest: partner could have spade queen, diamond queen, heart ace|pg||
nt|joest: but those values are hard to locate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4441@D|pg||
nt|kit: do they play rkc relay here?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess not needed -- Meckstroth can just set trumps with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL changes things -- but I bet it gives Meck MORE room|pg||
nt|joest: landen surprised tohear hearts bid at his left for sure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = asking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: choose not to ask|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT serious slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: Because with @C length in south, this could be a game-partial swing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|joest: i don't think Becker is passing|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he might move now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open 1@S. It gets too messy after 2@C with 6-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL, i think after 3@D   4@C=RKC @H  4@D=RKC @S|pg||
nt|kit: Even with king of diamonds wasted Meckstroth can still picture possible perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he bid 3@H?  There clearly can be no value to playing 4-4 fit opposite the 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|chorush: Picturing perfectos can be an expensive experience. Hamman says "If you need the perfect hand, I don't have it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@H is a RELAY [not setting trump]   with DBL, we need Walter|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps to set up a RKC for hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod writing a lot of explanation to Robinson.|pg||
nt|joest: now Cohler would like to bid 2@c natural|pg||
nt|lc: Since the Clerkins open so light, North doesn't drive to game -- even VUL, he only invites.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or a "why should they go down when I can" hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: at some point, Rod describes strength of hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: extremely unfriendly hand to declare for either side.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: blackwood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3keys|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: notwithstanding the breaks, you can get a lot of mileage in 2@c north-south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Thanks....I think."|pg||
nt|joest: where does he start? :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I have no clue. the only thing he probably likes about Coh;er's hand is the spade 9|pg||
nt|joest: and if he works diamonds, the jack will be an ominous sign|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|kit: So he will bid the slam|pg||
nt|joest: yes they are still mid auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: but if he asks about the trump queen, they might still hang short|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double surely means that West has the @DA and South has the @HA.|pg||
nt|kit: but partner might have xxxx of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HA is not such a good card, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: the double surely means only 1 diamond loser|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K ask|pg||
nt|lc: The kind of layout where Meckwell surely bid a VUl game.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|joest: he may duck this|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- what is 3@D?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = short @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry should have given you more time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: club 8 will eventually score|pg||
nt|leo lasota: queen clubs out of hand trick 2 would be my choice.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: as opposed to Meckwell  who open AS light  and went down in 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: Certainly not a bad VUL game.  One you would want to be in.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sry all too fastnow 3 tricks each|pg||
nt|lc: So, if this makes, the margin will be NICKELL by 1 with Board 64 (the final one) pending.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker thinks: '2-2 break at worst'.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: and it would be berk's choice as well. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: You are in good company. :)|pg||
nt|psyck: will just make as they cannot prevent @c ruff w/o giving up a trump trick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: yeah.  + partner might table Jxx or spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: So many IMPs riding on the lie of the cards. |pg||
nt|kit: good perecentage bid by Becker.  Unlucky about the double of 5@D.  Without that, I think Becker would have asked for queen of trumps and stopped.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what Rod said with DBL -- but they did nice job of stopping at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod: "trying to show some extras."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "This won't take long."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: landen has high hopes that his partner holds Jx in diamonds.  Unfortunately for him, berk has the second diamond, not pettis.|pg||
nt|chorush: this feels like if they offered Berk down 2 he would accept it|pg||
nt|joest: i know i would|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S = 1K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems counterintuitve for the hand with a void to be asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only Walter can explain what Meck's other options were|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chorush: Yes. It was very helpful for Meckstroth to know that Rodwell was specifically 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Amazing." -- when he sees the @c split.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, is 3NT a serious try?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, I see, you said so before, thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: they bid 6@s in the other room as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D doubled at the other table too...|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least it is fair if both teams bid (or do not bid) such a slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker shows his hand:  "Do the spades break?"|pg||
nt|kit: Note the clear victory for playing 0314 as opposed to 1430 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it;s usual for 3@S to be bid as an ask|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It surprises me that Becker did not ask for @SQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chorush: this is a hand where whoever is on lead wishes he were not|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true ira|pg||
nt|joest: i have a highconfidence level the ten of hearts comes next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't ever remember not usinf it before cuebidding...  maybe 3NT shows short @S with slam interest|pg||

nt|bigtrain: that would be consistent with other sytem structures|pg||

nt|joest: i believe we will restart about 15-20 minutes after the last board|pg||
nt|leo lasota: These are 2 great teams.  We are fortunate to have them in a close match in the finals for us to watch.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Last set will start soon after this one.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you recover from this match in time -- more vugraph from Toronto starting on Wednesday|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Last hand of the event.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php for  schedule with viewer's local time|pg||

nt|roswolf: is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Cornelia, David and Sigurdbjorn for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WOW|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, the score you see is not official.|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, Bruce.  We understand how difficult your job is.|pg||
nt|psyck: The next set will start in about 20 mins|pg||
nt|peachy: Next set will begin in about 15-20 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set|pg||
nt|kit: I like Becker's bid.  Gains when partner has xxxx of spades, okay if partner has Jxx, and if xxx, at worst 40%.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Ross, our excellent operator in Toronto. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: landen in 3@S East|pg||
mb|1N|nt|warrens:  exact same start against 6@H at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes thanks Ross!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great work, Ross!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, David, Jack and Kit|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks to start 1@d-1NT-2@h|pg||
nt|lc: Zia has lobbied for some bridge events to be played where everyone can see the score (at the table).  Wouldn't that make Bd. 64 even more exciting!|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you kibitzers for your participation with comments and questions. Hope to see you all back soon.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now that surprises me|pg||
nt|joest: pass risks a double part score swing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chorush: well he does have a stiff where partner opened but I hate to sell|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would not bid 2h at unfav with singleton in partner's openiong suit.  Very lucky that partner happens to have K10x of hearts this time, but there are many other holdings where you ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: may go for a big number.|pg||
nt|joest: your hand can get sealed off in 1NT and add five tricks or so to the pot in 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lest we forget -- full credit to Jan Martel for picking this match for tonight's vugraph!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yeah well life is a risk |pg||
nt|ady: part scorfe in one of the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: So, on proper defense, this looks to have 4 losers.|pg||
nt|lc: However, the defense need to get their @H trick going.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  as before   2@D=bal 8-10, no 5+ suit  3N=signoff|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Steve doesn't see it my way :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Joe, our excellent operator.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the commentator and the specs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: We will be back after a short break, perhaps 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks.  I've had a great time.|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead would be quite successful here -- should South overcall 2@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We should not let the last hand go without noting that a double of a Blackwood 5@D response on the @DA is not necessarily a wise move. You can see how it helped North here, at both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tables. It is different when you double a cue-bid with a high card sitting over the cue-bidder's high card.|pg||
nt|joest: a spade lead gives this a rough ride|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like routine 3NT headed down 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not -- Robinson has 109 of spades, so he will be under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: After a heart lead this is no gimme|pg||
nt|ritong: rodwell probably likes this auction|pg||
nt|lc: Oops -- I see @SK dropping.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chorush: Robinson not only has the 109 of spades but also the only diamond guard|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: link for results etc http://www.acbl.org/nabc/index.php?a=2011&b=Summer&c=daily_bulletins   results and bulletins|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: So heart lead, win, lose club hook, continue hearts, win, run clubs.  Robinson pitches 1 diamond, and then what?|pg||
nt|lc: Didn't at first see that.|pg||
nt|chorush: with the stiff spade K, only 3 losers|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: or even a heart lead and spade shift.  But difficult to fault club lead when hitting partner with just ace of clubs can be instant set.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true, but if the likely gain from bidding may be a double partial swing, while the downside is a potential telephone number, pass seems right.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Berk:  I suggest the king|pg||
nt|lc: And, of course, declarer has no choice but to lay down the @SA.|pg||
nt|phil: idiot stick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i tried to start a discussion on bridgewinners  about Barometer scoring for at least one event like this   --  it didn't get any input from the world class players :(|pg||
nt|phil: sry private|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Clerkins stopped in 3@H on 45  so seems we're going to see a lot of flip flop of leader board for a while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: match scores get posted to http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-32|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you tomorrow.|pg||
nt|lc: So, the usual -- NICKELL pulls out a close match.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores from women's semi-final  will be at  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2011/02/wagar/|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks to Bruce Gowdy as our vugraph operator|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't be surprised if you can't get to the scores page, it's undoubtedly being hit pretty hard now.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 minutes ago -- no final scores had been posted|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4: Fleisher beat 29: Hanlon 111 67|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|kit: Declarer will still have to sweat North having ace of hearts since the spades will block, but all is well.|pg||
nt|joest: other room: heart lead + spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: that is unweighted for frequency|pg||
nt|ady: 31 flat   |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Ross.  Great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: My pleasure. :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Yes, excellent job Russ.  Thanks!|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Ross :)|pg||
nt|chorush: thanks all. the fourth quarter looks like a real barn burner. We should resume in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It's OK, Leo -- I've been called worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 2 IMPs difference (if the scores are correct).  Don't change the channel.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's pretty loud suit preference @C4  and Cole obliges|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chorush: so I think this hand is makeable but needs some guessing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: whoa   last board of the 1st half   restart scheduled to begin in about 2 hours|pg||
nt|ady: if this is flat then a 9 imp pull up for Gordon|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will have to pitch a spade|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Well, it was an entertaining session - very enjoyable. No need to complain about the dull deals on this occasion.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: sorry a 13 imp pull up|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: I will certainly be back when the Spingold starts on Wednesday - one of the best events of the year.|pg||
nt|kit: Bud will Rodwell play for this, or play Boyd for Kx of spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe somebody on site can scope out scores in the LM Pairs|pg||
nt|kit: Now spade to jack, and when honor appears he will rethink.|pg||
nt|kit: I would expect he will get it right and play for this layout.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to play on spades to have any chance, so spade hook must be on.|pg||
nt|chorush: Robinson would always play spade 9 or 10 from 109xx so there is a guess involved|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson might have started with 109xx, QJxxx, Jx, Kx and discarded exactly the same way.|pg||
nt|chorush: Would you cash the diamond ace to see if, perhaps the diamond K has been blanked?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- spade hook first, then diamond to ace|pg||
nt|kit: spade hook always a must|pg||
nt|chorush: right, that will occur anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: however, 4@h is not cold|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: 26 is still a fair lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: 28|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|ady: th  x all   bye|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: now diamond to ace, and here we will be|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: sorry i forgot to credit George "DaMAN" Holland |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all specs for watching. We will be back soon with the second quarter|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: As pointed out, Robinson would (should!) always falsecard from the remaining holding of 109x, so 9 of spades not necessarily honest|pg||
nt|kit: He knows (or can assume) Robinson has the 10, but that doesn't solve the problem.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30 [our 5@D-4]   Becker playing a quiet 4@S EAST  after an unusual vs unusual auction|pg||
nt|chorush: Note that Boyd played the spade 6 and kept the 2, perhaps trying to influence Rodwell that Robinson was retaining the 2|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Robinson doesn't have to have king of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell gunts in frustration and dives back into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which gets us to      this is now a 34 board matcch|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's jack of diamonds might have been his last diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell: "Feels like a coin toss."|pg||
nt|kit: so Rodwell doesn't have the count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd: "Canadian or American."|pg||
nt|kit: he has the heart count, yes, but that isn't enough to tell him the shape|pg||
nt|chorush: well, there are more 5-3-3-2 hands than 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d8|nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  And why shouuld you credit him? Just because he makes more comments per square inch than most other people?|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: see you all in 25mins or so|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chorush: very nicely done by Rodwell.|pg||
nt|larrymori: indeed|pg||
nt|chorush: We will resume play in slightly less than 2 hours in a very close and exciting match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 31   Palmer-Cole also stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|larrymori: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Shutting down.|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  let s run to the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H went down|pg||
nt|loe48: yes spade switch kiled dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks every one.  We will see you in the Spingold/Wagar teams.|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - he was lucky the club ruff came in - a big swing board that one|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: that's a rare way to get +170|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye for now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 46 gets Nickell back on top   Zia-Hamman made 4@H where Meckwell stole 1N-3|pg||

nt|sybarra2: cu all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx Joh, Raija, and Al. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard the defense helped|pg||
nt|sybarra2: next set is in about 15-20 min is my guess |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart scheduled for 35 minutes  --  but since boards are NOT dupicated across other matches  you shouldn't stray too far from your computer|pg||
nt|sybarra2: think about 1/2 an hour|pg||
nt|sybarra2: also dont forget,  when you have seen enough spingold tonight,  we have vurgaph coming from melbourne |pg||
nt|ahollan1: session scores for spingold are being posted at  http://www.bridgewinners.com/index.php/spingold-round-of-32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: women's semi-final of the Wagar   eventually show up at  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2011/02/wagar/|pg||
