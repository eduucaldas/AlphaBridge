nt|vugrapha1: the system cards have to be on abf website www.abf.com.au|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H seems the obvious contract here|pg||
nt|babs59: "Natural Openings" means 15-17 1NT,  5 card Majors, 4 card D, 1C = 2+ with transfer responses (I believe)|pg||

nt|roswolf: even bill should make this one:)|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: declarer has a choice of 3 finesses for his contract - but if NS don't cash a 2nd @d he can claim on the ruffing finesse|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mamos: so North has done well  -- the way I plat 3@S shows 4 Spades but a minimum in points I think it's hard for North to pas  but the right thing here as it happens|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|loganrun: Could not agree more Henry - a weak two doesn't start to show the playing strength|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@H is everyone's contract surely|pg||
nt|babs59: from memory, NS use 2C as either a Drury type of bid or for Limit Raise hands|pg||

nt|henryb:  4@s looks pretty safe for N-S|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11+, 0+C|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a part-score hand I think|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but maybe 4@s|pg||
nt|babs59: and during the qualifying rounds, in reality each IMP is worth 2 IMPs because if you win by 25 IMPs, the score is +25 for the winners, and -25 for the losing team|pg||
nt|mamos: EW in Or got in a muddle after 1@s x and a conventional 3@h was accidentally passed out|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: club guess in trick one but normal J makes the day in 3nt|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|vugrapha3: One of the bidding boxes just spilled, the director has been called to fix the situation|pg||
nt|mamos: the Diamond position is unkind |pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could be close|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open Room, West must have meant his 3H to be 10-12 points with 3-card support for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so the defence start off ahead here |pg||
nt|babs59: however, the double confused the issue |pg||
nt|henryb:  who will get to bis @s first?|pg||

nt|henryb:  and probably some distributional info as well|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|mamos: yes as a spectator comments EW will gain imps for bidding 4@S even if it fails by a couple|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|runnerup: ok your partner was not on map -double partner  (norths thoughs)|pg||
nt|xenya: some specs suggest that N's pass had to be forcing -- but i fail to see why|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  this is the start of an auction where E-W run out of pass cards in their bidding boxes :)|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: if you have support double you cant double for penalties in this hand -so either bid 3nt or trust your partners double to takout|pg||
