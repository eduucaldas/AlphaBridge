mb|p|nt|vbman: letts see grand bidding|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hello. In princple we have Finnish here but so few Finnish kibbers we've been typing in English|pg||
nt|richie: 6@d can be made here, but I guess they will stop in 3NT or 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|tinta:  I do not think they bid to 4 @h|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mmmakela: I wouldn't open the N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: single h is xtremely important|pg||
nt|plateos: I thought that at this VUL there is a risk of phantom sacrifice of 5@h over 5@d but they seem to take it as partscore battle!|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: EW play strong club possibly with an artificial 2@C, so I'm not sure if East had told anything about diamonds when he bid 1@S|pg||

pc|s7|nt|kaapo: But 3@d must have told the story|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the miracle club play|pg||
nt|kaapo: This is the semifinal match of the Finnish Cup. Earlier stages of the competition have been played throughout the year, some early matches even on BBO|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: NS play natural with 5-card majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: *dias|pg||
nt|vbman: h ace wont do|pg||
nt|plateos: Paganus won 9 imp in missing the lucky slam when NS in the ohermroom played 1@h!|pg||

nt|bobholl: i am not always a bad guesser :) :) but mostly i am |pg||
nt|tinta:  Operatro told that Englund was not at all happy seeing dummy|pg||
nt|plateos: It is nice to (still) agree with Tinta as we played a regular partnerhis 20 years ago when I still played the game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|can be only 2cards|nt|vbman: must stay away from ths slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|louisg: and thanks to you as well, Danny.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tinta:  5 @h ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3 or 4@H as E ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janroberts:  and thank you for "hosting" this event, Danny|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|tinta:  :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|guru:  Special thanks to Mike Geisler for coordinating not only this vugraph but the entire Solomon teams event|pg||
nt|tinta:  If Paganus's team wins this one we still have a lot of time for comeback|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: VG ops, Allison Brandt, and Ala Hamilton Day, and Mike Giesler for coordinating|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the open room, East doubled 1@H for take out. With just 3 small spades and @HQx pass may be better in the long run|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tinta:  This should be an easy make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: 2@C was almost forcing to game|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sauvola could bid a forcing 2NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|louisg: Yes, Mike puts a lot of work into this.|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: Other semifinal Paganus is leading 44-11 against Jänkälä.|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
mc|7|nt|plateos: yes admittably 1@c is worse than 2@h in this deal, some gadgets are needed, e.g. transfers as suggested by a kib.|pg||

nt|kaapo: 4@S looks quite exotic|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Yes|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose they might end up at 3NT here. Or perhaps just 2|pg||

nt|richie: yes, NS misunderstood the meaning of 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l think 1sp was fine|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks like EW don't have a natural @C opening at all, else Lösönen might open with 2@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: the colours are a little bit thin for 4NT :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|tinta:  Or making ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vbman: they seem to know what they are doing|pg||
nt|famus: ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|richie: 2@d is safer|pg||
nt|tinta:  Difficult one but the younsters in other table might be braver|pg||
nt|tinta:  let's see at least they need some swing to even the match|pg||
nt|bobholl: other table in 5@H doubled on 13 |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|guru:  Anyone bidding 1S with Rick's hand?|pg||
nt|3for3: I would|pg||
nt|tinta:  If declarer overtakes @h J for finessing in @c will be down|pg||
nt|plateos: Paganus has taken a very decisive lead because the phantom sacrifice of 5@h I predicted was made in the other room while EW here X.ed 4@h makikng.  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|louisg: For sure I am.|pg||
nt|louisg: Not close for me, with the club fit and the vulnerability.|pg||
nt|janroberts:  I do|pg||
nt|kaapo: So he's probably now just shown about 14-16 with 6+@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: as so often the 5 level was for the opponents :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

pc|c2|nt|tinta:  Too brave youngsters ???|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim time :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|3for3: I would not be sad if partner raised to game, with my secondary fit for clubs.  Plus, I like to preempt the heart suit|pg||
nt|tinta:  Two game swigns to Pekkinen on boards 27 and 28 but probably not enough|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|richie: but not safe enough ::)|pg||
nt|bobholl: these are the boards decisions are made on |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: safe and safe?|pg||
