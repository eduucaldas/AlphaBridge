nt|frankaus: maybe 4@S over 41H will get a @S lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: possible.|pg||
nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: this board should be shown to those who claims not to open weak 2 with Hxx in the other major :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: co nienajlepiej siê dzieje w polskiej dru¿ynie jeli zmienia siê pary|pg||
nt|frankaus: expecting  - 3rg try :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3rd :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S may be passed and would be a good board for NL.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ryskiel who will be commenting in Polish|pg||

nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N showed minimum and S hand is not that strong for the raise.|pg||

nt|sybarra: has a lot to do with little transportation |pg||
nt|riccho:  If the defense is not able to punish W for his bidding, will W go even further with his preempt bidding? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ekspecki wist w 8@d|pg||
nt|bcmandal: clubs 3-3 5d makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: Hello :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must admit too hard to avoid 3NT here, i'm i wudnt have|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: ah thats trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not that easy to be reach..|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Dr Raghavan|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot off waisted values in @c ontrack -in diamonds ,but here you need thos e honors |pg||
nt|raghavan: GM marukku - again we meet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bcmandal: 2s+1d|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bcmandal: 3s+1d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko ¿e teraz mo¿e powstaæ poszum...na szczêcie nie|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: S would be careful in discards to save the @S.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like he is home now |pg||
nt|riccho:  but after 2times non-club play N has enought tricks |pg||
pc|d3|nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  A general word to kibitzers: I get about 10 comments from you a minute. I can't respond to all, in fact to very few, but I do appreciate them|pg||
nt|loe48: very careful by N with 10 points, but as we see have no real s stopper so cant bid  1nt |pg||
nt|panosk: sturned to hearts hence the result|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: @D or @C |pg||
nt|panosk: * S turned|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: if north did double then south might bid 4@D - if you can make a partscore your way it's always just bad news to let opps get away with losing a 50 or two|pg||

pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey|pg||
nt|sybarra: but does get the hand across in one bid |pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play clubs or Hearts knowing Spade Q is a possible entry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|panosk: shud also be carefull of clubs as he/she knows that S is 5-4 at aleast hence no more than 3-4 cards in rest suits|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||

nt|runnerup: ofcause to start there was no chance except defensive mistake ,but that came|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||

nt|sybarra: if @D ruff on opening lead,  all returns won  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: guess of q@D.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it all depends on the @D |pg||
nt|raghavan: will they play in 4S or 4H|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be H due to known 6-3 fit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eugenio123: all pass I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So the only boards with som imps was the 3@c -1 that Fra find 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|juror1: witamy Piotra Zatorskiego|pg||
mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: witam|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT gamling - one of the worst conventions ever invented IMO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S A as recommended defense.|pg||
nt|frankaus: u lead ur top card view dummy will always set it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: or @D Ace.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h needs finess only about so near 50%|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||
nt|pinticus: so it is 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H diff to make imagine E trying for highet as he shud|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

mb|d|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||

nt|garden2005: dobry wieczór wszystkim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||
nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||

nt|riccho:  the reason for doubling is misterious to me|pg||
mb|4C|nt|gronkvist:  It not my cup of tea to play this way but you have too if u should play with the youngsters ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||
nt|riccho:  dont understand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||
nt|sybarra: record would have fallen Richard|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  N is very optimistic player i said before ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is a useful convention here: XX here from E would show doubt about the contract |pg||
nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  2 down again |pg||
nt|loe48: well. as we see this contract has no chanse as both sides overbid their hands|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If E plays @DK first then 6.|pg||

nt|panosk: 3@D very gd bid in open room to still the part score|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: That was an averagish result|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  3N is down on accurate defense, but perhaps hard to avoid|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  Yes if u could bid 1nt with a weak raise :)|pg||
nt|saverio: y|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Grönkvist suppressed her nice spade suit|pg||

nt|frankaus: this is game F in most systems|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a lot of bidding and so far we are at the 2 level |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Jansma is wrong to bid 4N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Show spades first, then support diamonds later if needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: which is  probably as high as they should be |pg||
nt|rnmalik: This was battle of nerves:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  what are we learning from last bd? If u play vs an opponent who might double you only for the reason that you go into 4@c. Stay where u are.|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is time to go over every hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: must not play puppet or neimeijer or whatever it is called there|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: after more info exchanged, E should maybe have settled for 5m|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Can N find the @h10?|pg||
nt|athene: east might have dropped the @SJ at trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: suggesting spade shortagein his hand and hence more heart length|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is FG against the strong hand(if she has the strong one)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like to follow other tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|eugenio123: good bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: trump lead seems to be normal|pg||

nt|chrisky: ew too high|pg||
nt|riccho:  both teams are getting in two-digit-imps mode here again|pg||
pc|s9|nt|possessed: she dont know about clubs now, she might pass probably to 3nt|pg||

nt|rodal f: Would puppet helped them? Seems so|pg||
nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a lead lol |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: South, of the other hand, can already be considered "Veteran". Ida Gronkvist is playing for Sweden in the European Championship for the 3rd time|pg||

nt|chrisky: i can see 7 tricks |pg||

pc|d3|nt|psyck: donno, looks too suspesious|pg||

nt|henryb:  92% for E-W, who also got 70% on the first board|pg||

nt|henryb:  so much for my predictions|pg||
nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||
nt|loe48: and the hand is not worth more imo|pg||
nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|cicus: better late than never|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey Grozio :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: your countrymates need some support :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam for EW.|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room also,  they used 2 @H as negative bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 10 the other way!!|pg||
nt|riccho:  sry IÂ´m head shaking|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
nt|loe48: open 1h helped opponents to win 4s|pg||

mb|3S|nt|cicus: this hand may help if the French go too high|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, bd 11 is missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would need valium for coaching here |pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: @H|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: S juz to mogl wygrac przebijajac 2 kara ze stolu co postawiloby W w przymusie|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I suggest 2@h by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
pc|sA|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ryskiel_: czy to Silna Grupa Pod Wezwaniem?|pg||
nt|mareczek: witajcie :)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hi:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But 7 down is a good score for EW|pg||
nt|mareczek: ale, swoj¹ drog¹, grupa o której pisa³em, na pewno zas³uguje na miano silnej, co prawda mo¿e nie az takiej, jak Chya³ et co.|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|eugenio123: when your opp bids in this way it is sure he's got good stoppers in majors|pg||
nt|riccho:  A10xx in @c ...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer most likely will find the Q@d , after seeing AK @s A@c in South|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity for declarer that @S4 is so low|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  yeah seems logical|pg||

nt|cicus: a bold 2NT now by W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 6@s from N should be interesting...will E find the A@h lead and continuation?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: an aggresive choice with that hand|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hmm with the 1@H overcall|pg||

nt|chrisky: an e...:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  east makes it difficult to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@d = void @d, 6-9 points and 2 keycards or 15+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: adn 2 nt is usually honor 3 or better  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the relay suit saying "I like clubs" |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hard to reach 3NT |pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt shud be spade fit and forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: omg, a pushed bd |pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  my guess is all pass now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pewnie jeszcze padnie 5 trefli - 5 karo i wreszcie 5 kier|pg||

nt|yuval10: S IMO has a lot more than enough to carry on. He can see slam's making against A@s QJ@h Q@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes even less than that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @H lead, may be 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S by E now|pg||
nt|riccho:  really|pg||
nt|sybarra: can that be possible here? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: hmm, it does not sound like a strong NT now, does it?|pg||

nt|mareczek: brak cue bidu pik|pg||

nt|mareczek: 5@d powinno obiecywac zatrzymanie w pominietym przez partnera kolorze|pg||
nt|riccho:  same weird lead as at the other table...|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying for the club ruff is my guess |pg||
nt|riccho:  compare the 3@s here with what W had done in bd 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand a far better (imo)|pg||
nt|riccho:  is this really the difference between red and white?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: Hands like these to not to overbid win matches. 3@S was weak and should have been passed after call over call.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A dia lead could be a good start for EW|pg||

pc|c7|nt|timverbeek:  if you pass every time with these kinds of hands|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: brawo, na drugim stole doszli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: guess now )?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|eugenio123: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|cicus: probably playing on @Ds, not @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: i didnt mean anything different than expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: easy 4 @h|pg||
nt|cicus: easily the best play|pg||
nt|cicus: to let @DQ run|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid that was not my guess |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh,  is he thinking 6 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: he is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might well see E try ak of clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E probably sighed with releif |pg||
nt|sybarra: *relief|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF the spade cashes |pg||
nt|riccho:  another big swing here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: if K of spade lead,  E shor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I stopped typing |pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we find that lead?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|raghavan: looks like making 4 |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|cicus: it is suggested that this should be taken in dummy and a @H led - but what if N ducks smoothly?|pg||
nt|szalay:  call hr magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  her|pg||
nt|szalay:  and give her Hermione role in next chapter|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the @HK is not easy to duck although what will W hold to justify jumping to 3@H?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw better to play Q: not so easy to duck|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: just a question of overtricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|timverbeek:  another heart would give declarer problems|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
nt|rnmalik: needed passive defence, small @S.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to do given E hand with the aces I think |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Long trumps long suit lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we are watching "youngsters" |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree they are better players, I admit.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|redds: ciezko powiedziec co znaczyla licytacja naszych, jakies pomysly ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: thx to specs for their ideas but i wud expect it to be something like this competitve but not invitational|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: but he is on his way to it now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||
nt|vbman: after 3sp south needs to bid 4cl, this is a bidders game|pg||
nt|sybarra: try the ace of spades ? |pg||

nt|rnmalik: only a NT contract can be made. A@S and ruff would set any other contract.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  perhaps not - I was assuming E would lead the @dA|pg||
nt|psyck: @d punches will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  He will go down anyway on the @s lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's overcall is marginal, and it forced him to an uncomfotable bid in the 2nd round|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sybarra: 2 @S X went for 1100  better get this right! |pg||

nt|riccho:  3@h is a bit too much. If you play a WK NT style. Partner should expect a 15 HCP Hand BAL type with 2@h already. No need to raise the bidding more than that|pg||
