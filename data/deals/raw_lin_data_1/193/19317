mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: uh oh|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|pinticus: very aggressive bid 2@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He needs to scramble 5 tricks to avoid a big minus|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cumino: He should play @D as quick as possible|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At least he had good spade spots ... which is the only way the 2@S can be justified|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That low club play, from AKxx, seems to me to show that this partnership is well tuned|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably, @S3 was suit preference|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|s4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pinticus: OR 3nt by S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So he's solid now for 5 tricks, and the cost might only be 1-2 imps|pg||
nt|pinticus: seems 2 MP to Israel|pg||
nt|cumino: I presume 500 vs 430 or so|pg||

pc|dK|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: If you think that 2@S bid is too risky, then I would suggest you bid 1@S.  I don't think it's acceptable for West to pass over 1@C|pg||

nt|uttam: good aft from India|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Netherlands are 7th currently, which means they have plenty of motivation (6th place goes to the world championship)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|oosb: Straight forward 3NT to start with|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
nt|kemperg: so an important match|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like this can make, losing a @C, 2@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CK and @DK weel placed, no problems |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: ok han er ikke her|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi apecs - Minko - Richard|pg||
nt|2hplus4: hi there everyone|pg||
nt|2hplus4: N might have tried a second round X|pg||
mb|3S|nt|uttam: hi Oosman bhai|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
mb|3N|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like the 4@S bid myself, it looks more like 3@S to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  9 lucky tricks E/! in a @S-contract|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@h in the other room|pg||
nt|dagold: on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've see Birman lead 4th instead of 3rd, starting to wonder about that|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR W in 3@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: very simple equation for Agustin and co... they must win.. and win big|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eliran_a: hi all and welcome going to be a great match ! 1st against the 2nd !|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: but Israel will probably have to say something about this ....|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we must say that they had a great tournament.. fantastic players|pg||
nt|richie: probably, let's see, it has already been proven they are excellent players but  not infallable|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol... |pg||
nt|bebechira: Eliran will say something about this for sure....|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Markku|pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marionmi:  hi all|pg||
nt|richie: hi Marion :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good mornin - dzieñ dobry - witam Pañstwa w ostatnim dniu rozgrywek dziewcz¹t|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: will go down 3 against a partscore at best|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||
nt|oosb: even @C are blocked for defence|pg||
nt|uttam: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  very important match here between the nr 1 and 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jest to przedostania runda, druga po³owa meczy pomiêdzy dwiema pierwszymi dru¿ynami w tabeli|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 4S but it should have cost|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|richie: great result for the french in the open room, +500|pg||
nt|iceblue: misunderstood, i guess|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hei alle. Sorry for at eg e litt sein.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gronkvist:  1@c is 12-14 ntor 18-19 Nt or Natural with transfer respones|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dan_ehh: possibly going down now, as Padon has discarded his low @H and might get to ruff declarer's king|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eliran_a: both players of italy and israel are players from the highest level in the juniors playing over 8 or 9 years of massive bridge |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bebechira: west in 2s dbled in the open room...fireworks starting... very good|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|bebechira: may be special sequence|pg||
nt|raghavan: PARTNER OPENS BEUGER HAS good hand why stop in 2D|pg||
nt|iceblue: S must play this 2@D as XYZ, game forcing.|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
nt|chick: doubled would have cost enough to make my point :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: i am expecting a high level match with some creative stuff ! the players are really talented|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps in 2nd seat 3S is enough|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eleni: but the contract is makeable, as the @h finess works:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  WAS on tiÂ´s way...|pg||
nt|mrdct: she has a beer card too|pg||
nt|richie: 3x@h now and exit a low club will work (double dummy) hard to see with closed cards|pg||
nt|richie: not low club but 7 or 8|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table I think Rosaline Barendregt had to escape from 1@sX, it's usually bloody when opps pass a TO dbl on the 1 level, but not sure if 2@hX is such a big party|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still -100 should be good for N/S|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S is actually less likely to be doubled for penalty than 4@S is|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|richie: straight forward line will succeed here, taking 1 rounds of trump and ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well done|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|josj: what will happen to that 3rd spade?|pg||
nt|richie: 3nt = 430 and in 2@s you have 6 tricks so -300 it seems|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Do you ever get tired of winning? :)|pg||
nt|ofirgi:  At the close room italy faail in 4heart...|pg||
nt|cumino: 4@h is not so easy too|pg||
nt|ofirgi:  here we just need to hope that East will not find the Club switch..|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pinticus: great shift :)|pg||
nt|ofirgi:  And Roland... we never get tierd.. but hard time now... ;)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That was a great shift.  East had an alternative strategy, which was to play partner for xx-xx-AJ10xx-xxx or similar|pg||
nt|cumino: Very good Di Franco, here in BBO "SUPERMAX" |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But perhaps such a layout is not consistent with partner's @H10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If @H10 suggested that partner had @HA10 doubleton, then clearly, the club shift was the best chance|pg||

nt|doks: 15 round of Juniors Championship 3rd and 7th place match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: only 5 tricks in the closed it seems.... so what is 2 imps between friends|pg||
mb|d|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a flat board of 10 tricks in hearts contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sitting well enough to make 4@h|pg||
nt|richie: many people will bid 1NT in north, but I like dbl more when you hold only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: England had a steady start in the test vs India... cricket of course|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||
nt|bebechira: team profiles Netherlands http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: byæ mo¿e nie wszyscy wiedz¹, ¿e Joanna Taczewska to Joanna Krawczyk - chyba najbardziejutytulowana juniorka na wiecie, która z³ote medale zdeobywa³a tak¿e w reprezentacji open ...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: juniorskiej |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but N would not have been doubling for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: not only is it a level lower, but it would double to game, whereas NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: so it's safer, and might push the opps too high, whereas 4@S has all the downsides|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||
nt|bebechira: for France|pg||
nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=FRANCE@@892|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT looks like being beaten by a S lead from either side|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@C is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I wonder if they can find it after west showing both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 2d=good raise|pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood to Israel|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s went 3 down, first imps to Israel|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes this difficult |pg||
nt|richie: "blood" ? :) they score in IMPS not in blood|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT very good in closed room, only 9 triks in 4@H withot defencive help|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: well... i would argue this in this match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: Schwartz in 3nt|pg||
nt|eliran_a: only if west had 3 hearts 4@h could go down on a @s lead now as the cards set nothing can take it down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks beatable|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT can be defeated with a @clead or return, 4@h is shaky but it should make|pg||
nt|richie: Madala fears @cA is wrong for him...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||

nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|bebechira: 3off for 500?|pg||

pc|cA|nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, 5@h is only made when you have no heart loosers|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjr: i think 2NT was forsing to 3@c, but didn't hear well|pg||
nt|ofirgi:  south should X the board while he is holding 3 aces and pd respond..|pg||

nt|2hplus4: Declarer could play D for K in S or J in N singletons|pg||
mb|1D|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||

mb|2C|nt|frankbo: fikk hjem 4S i åpent på første spillet|pg||
nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the Dutch girls draw the first blood|pg||
nt|bebechira: just came home...from dinner|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh puppet stayman, I keep forgetting that|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @s can be dwfeated here|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes D not good enough the other way declarer played properly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|richie: they may even get to 4@s, dbl-ed in south?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR @CQ is the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: -west argees and 500?|pg||
nt|richie: west has a pretty good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think I like 3N with the E hand even though there is a remote chance of finding a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now should be fine|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N and find partner with xx in @S or @C :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: dror have a nice hand but still his daimonds are useless|pg||
nt|eliran_a: not a good hand to raise with for a game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|2hplus4: Good lead when dummy is known to be short in D|pg||
nt|richie: is 3@h semi-natural? east could also bid 3@d as invitation|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 2 down if the defence finds the @h ruff|pg||
pc|h9|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
nt|richie: @H2 is a clear indication|pg||
pc|cT|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||

nt|bcmandal: had he played k?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ruff a diamond, ruff a heart high, spade to the ace, is that not good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you only lose 2 clubs and 1 spade|pg||
nt|cumino: @D ruff and club better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The question is whether you have the control to take the third club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think you do possibly have to play clubs earlier yourself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can probably tap tou out of your club winner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so club first seems better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At this point, I'd be saying: "well done East in the other room to make this contract"|pg||
nt|cumino: The player in closed room was facilitated by double. He knew K@S off|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: easy 6nt|pg||

mb|2S|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and he bid 4nt...this can be a big swing for Italy|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s -you must avoid @s finess -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: yea , its becoming more and more common to respond the opening bid with negative hands , less then 6 points |pg||
nt|richie: I would dbl in south, your hearts are a bit too weak to bid them and you have some alternatives|pg||
mb|d|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: should play in part score|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
nt|eliran_a: also x from north here|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, west will bid 4@s, no matter what, north dbl I think |pg||
mb|d|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||

nt|eliran_a: this should be end the action|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@d denies 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||

nt|eliran_a: and a heart lead looks normal|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I 've great fan of Israel way to play bridge|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But not in this match|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A tough choice for W there|pg||
nt|andyv:  being Greek, I was rooting for Zambia|pg||
nt|richie: only when declarer decides to finesse in @s he may go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: quess to do make/ down -spades finess -or club J -south|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Birman 2@s openening is a good weak 2 8-10 points |pg||
nt|eliran_a: sry only in 1st and 2nd seat . so here its weak 2 6-10|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: dummy always tables the jack when I lead K from KQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now down|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he is young man man so they love attacking leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure he ducked?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|s6|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing strong K we lead the Q here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||

nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||

nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Lothan is an expert|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|murat e: does not matter since 4th spade is good problem is to bid the game|pg||
nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is the only lead to set 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
nt|kemperg: but I ment the 4@S in N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||

pc|s6|nt|josj: assuming 1@S shows five already, passing 2@H is mandatory, een more so with this particular partner|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: maybe Birman can bid a "bad" 2NT here as Padon surely has a fit in one of the minors|pg||
nt|eliran_a: the action gonna end in 3cl|pg||

mb|p|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the club you often see people ruffs with their small trumphs that you need later :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @s |pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: 14 imps to israel on board 4 for making 3NX+2|pg||

nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: there 2-3 marginal boards per set///and they must be given special attention|pg||
nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h|pg||
nt|doks: 2@H is on, so going down in 3@C are not that bad|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes intreshing auction|pg||
nt|eliran_a: might be a little swing for israel in this board , N-S can make 3@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1Cl was 12-14 / 18-19 Bal or Nat|pg||
pc|h6|nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is perhaps a bit of a stretch but Cilla would have raised 3 anyway|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Remind that E just shows 6 points w the double :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Play should not take long either He'll try to ruff D in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
pc|c9|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@S should make with the favorable @H lie|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad or scramble, 2N is goaad|pg||
nt|kemperg: good|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: favorable @S lie too, need two entries to finesse twice|pg||
nt|kemperg: my typing is bad today:(|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4 of a minor makes too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
nt|doks: same contract here as well|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
nt|2hplus4: These 5 major + 4 minor bids are fine if you win the auction|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|bebechira: farnce 157 sweden 156 after 21 brds|pg||
nt|bebechira: france |pg||
nt|richie: yes, they overjumped them - poor swedes at the open room, they missed a few chances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If you defend, it is almost double dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|richie: I am not sure if NS can enter the bidding, but there is a greater risk EW will play in @d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this goes dont with normal play perhaps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|doks: by the way, Denmark take 3rd place now, by leading 22-0 vs Poland|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
nt|richie: farce?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the it seems like 4@s should make even with a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W tried to pull trump immediately which cause the loss of control on hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It seems normal to cash @CAK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco going down...so 13 to Israel soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: now he is going down|pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 3@c|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: sneaky switch|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but west can see that everything works for declarer, so why not|pg||
nt|kemperg: only entries are in trump, that's leaders problem|pg||
pc|h3|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he is home|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  now no problems|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|bebechira: the swedish girls are my favourites for the bronze|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|timve:  yeah always hard to see for east|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ok, then its not THAT expensive since 3N made here. but on the other hand, they surely would have found the killing lead so they lost a chance for a big pickup|pg||
pc|c5|nt|richie: @d for 1 looser: you have to guess which of your opponents has Honour doubleton: either play small to JTx or play J|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: not to be fooled|pg||

pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  We have been told, that West can always make 4 ! S - I call it double-dummy|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S  a normal outcome of this deal|pg||
nt|gio 89: if E menages to hold it to -3/4 it could be a push since NS should make 4@H|pg||

nt|neobas: Not a good result for the Dutch in the OR|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  5 cl in other room here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: whenever i open those sorts of hands i write down -110 5 minutes later|pg||
nt|frankaus: no of @S is an important factor|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|spenny80: here 4@s could make|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the Dutch girls now to recover some imps?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: B4 2@HE as here.|pg||
nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
nt|2hplus4: france made 3NT on 2NT hand. declarer played a D at trick 2 which was ducked|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: just need AK of @H for 6 |pg||
nt|kemperg: tried for 6, will now bid4, S showed a minimum|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H likely some sort of minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|doks: after quite partscore, doubled slam deal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: still trying|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
nt|chick: poor defense doesn't count :)|pg||
nt|chick: finally EW bid hearts|pg||
mb|3N|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Counted for about 15 IMPs there!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
nt|doks: other room Lightner double discover @S suit and @DQ as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks ok on the surface, but there is a forcing defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: its a 50% slam|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT overcall here, even though you don't have a double stopper you have plenty of tricks available - 2@c overcall would make life much more complicated|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: @S are not in picture this deal here. Goes for @D slam probably|pg||
nt|chick: yes, counts for score but not for whether to bid it or not :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
nt|doks: E expected more from W 3@D bid, so both Q must be found|pg||
nt|doks: very big swing on air|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes either way|pg||
nt|chick: or as someone points out, a simpler club ruff :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
nt|2hplus4: C ruff gets it over quickly but even so declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|cK|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||
nt|richie: I don't remember :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we have seen examples of a 4-2 fit being the only makeable game|pg||
nt|doks: imagine You play vs Zia siting on S and DBL 7@D. Where You place @DQ?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: playing safely|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||
nt|eleni: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome@h|pg||
nt|josj: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|spenny80: thanks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think thier rule is to playing their ordinary system when W could bid nat 2@h but if Opps bid after the answer they play more natural like that Cilla thought|pg||
nt|doks: E was completely sure about @DQ on W, he dont even ask|pg||
nt|bcmandal: my way|pg||
nt|doks: or 6th @D|pg||
nt|bcmandal: another hurdlt|pg||
nt|bcmandal: hurdle|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hmm, west can't get more than one ruff, so maybe safely was not required here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|richie: it seems they did not have this tool of 1@s so rosaline Barendregt decided for 2@c|pg||
nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...8 tricks for the taking... and 1 imp for France|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|frankbo: der håkon og lars spillte 3N minus fire meldte det 7kl dbl med 800|pg||
nt|loe48: det kan sies at det er en liten forskjell i meldestil paa det spillet ja :)|pg||
nt|loe48: kan fort skje med missfortaaelse av melding|pg||
nt|spenny80: wd|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at that dummy - getting rid of an entry to the @d suit looks stand-out|pg||
nt|mrdct: good defence|pg||
nt|richie: 2nd problem was the biggest problem it seems|pg||
pc|h5|nt|doks: if He founds @DQ, then more probably founds @SQ as well|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona: well, 3N can perhaps get home on 6|pg||
nt|bebechira: the damage was the 730 lol|pg||
nt|richie: yes:) :(|pg||

pc|h8|nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||
nt|richie: no overcall in spades at the other table, so the contract is played in north, it could make a difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A board to forget for Sweden in both rooms. Happens to all of us|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|richie: must be a relief to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: next WC in Cuba 2012 for the youngsters.... a nice trip|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gronkvist:  luckily that is that north w 4@h|pg||
nt|chick: now his goose is cooked|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|rodal f: S came in with a splinter in @S Xed from W so the @S lead came from E.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: (sorry for the slang) ... he is out of luck|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I thought we were on a daytime cookery show|pg||
nt|chick: is best hope is to play 3 diamonds and hope that N has to give him a black suit trick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bebechira: 12 tricks and next...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gronkvist:  so 2 down here and first good board for Isr|pg||

nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||

nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  this contract will make, but 2@s might make as well|pg||
nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT good for NED, but from right side (W) there are no defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The 1@C - 2@D overcall (weak) is a really valuable tool, because it's tough on the opponents who have TWO majors to explore|pg||

nt|loe48: i think i had tried 2nt over 2s, not re x|pg||
nt|loe48: then 3c-3d|pg||
nt|richie: yes, look at the other matches: Poland will play Italy, Netherlands, France and Netherlands will play France, Poland Sweden |pg||
nt|bebechira: i play some sort of multi|pg||
nt|richie: you can say whatever you want, but it's not boring|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky not doubled|pg||
nt|doks: so we have allmost level at this match|pg||
mb|1S|nt|uttam: scotland has opened their a/c|pg||
nt|richie: I prefer 3@h|pg||
nt|bebechira: we integrated in precision|pg||
nt|richie: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N makes here and 4@s didn't in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 2@H Muiderberg|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol...Friday and Saturday will be a feast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for Danish supporters. Denmark were 0-25 down after 4 boards, now the scoreline reads 33-25|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: EW make lots of tricks in C|pg||
nt|chick: I think they can make 5@C with some crossruffing|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are on brd 10 and the closed is on brd 7|pg||
nt|richie: east has only 9HCP but great values and a void, it's enough to open 1@s|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|murat e: 4 of a major too high for both|pg||
nt|asig: NS may bid 4@h on this one|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice 5 @d but because ew om board -cards well placed and makes :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: can may 6@c or 6@s here if you are good at dropping Qs offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I say that North should nt take bidding to shes hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: against Italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: i vugraphed Ron-Lotan in Philadelphia and they drove me crazy... the slowest juniors ever|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: and go 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 6@S-1 i OR og 17IMP til Belgia.|pg||
nt|loe48: med 2 langfarver so i den 6nt de meldte her er beste kontrakt alltid  6nt..for det er nok en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as def slipped at 1!NX made 7 and Netherland back in the lead.|pg||
nt|ntmon: large gain for Italy, now match almost close|pg||
nt|spenny80: they don't play polish club?|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming the dbl promises 4@s (i have no idea if it does)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not sure|pg||
nt|doks: if I remember correctly, this is of city in NED|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h seems makeable|pg||
mb|4D|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i heard polish club is out of favour with a lot of the juniors these days|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Is he good enough for 5C?|pg||
nt|richie: now he tells partner about the good fit and shortness in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
nt|chick: the @D bid makes his singleton worth more (less chance partner has wasted values there)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E may save the day|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Lotan player with bar taranovski in phili|pg||
nt|eliran_a: played|pg||
nt|eliran_a: but they are still slow|pg||
mb|5C|nt|murat e: east must avoid spade lead though|pg||
nt|oosb: Is everyone bidding 3@H here?|pg||
nt|uttam: 4h|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure after the x..|pg||
nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||
nt|richie: straightforward 3NT, @hK is protected so it should  not be very problematic|pg||
nt|antoniz: Witam serdecznie|pg||
nt|doks: 2M promises 5M and 4+ in any minor weaker than normal opening|pg||
nt|chick: 5 clubs to the Q and a major suit Q are all he needs|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: no, well done|pg||
nt|loe48: saa 6 spar er prosentmessig mye daarligere|pg||
nt|bebechira: easy 4s here.... |pg||
nt|richie: Friday and Sat?|pg||
nt|richie: time to claim :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: S must no its a misfit for him, p has 4 or 5 @H|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass good|pg||
nt|richie: I believe you have to do too much work in 6@s, unless North leads @dK there is a chance|pg||
mb|5D|nt|spenny80: 3@d i think is forcing...|pg||
nt|richie: what happened here? doesn't west have a normal 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|richie: in 1NT you count 7 tricks when you manage to make 3 spade tricks, best line would be to attack them a.s.a.p. and leave the heart suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: you want to help here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: sorry.....private|pg||
nt|richie: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: tell us what was the mood in the Dutch camp after the defeat to Poland|pg||
nt|bebechira: oh yes... where Tarnovski disspeared?|pg||
nt|bebechira: very talented as well|pg||
mb|5H|nt|josj: I hope so :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ok|pg||
nt|chick: 4@D down one but he has to do the hearts right for that|pg||
nt|richie: 5@c is an overbid IMO - after the splinter 4@h tells your hand enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: thu we have 17.18, fri 19.20 and sat 21 isn't it?|pg||
nt|bebechira: strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: oh|pg||
nt|spenny80: lol|pg||
nt|doks: I recieve some very trustfully confirmations about my bridge history knowledges.|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 4@d i guess is a last train bid , and 5 daimond is first cue bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: nice stop |pg||
nt|runnerup: and in that number 7 -west bid 2@c with that hand -which was 1nt here -so they never found any big ns -300 but not enought -so listen to Richie 1nt with such hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's better not to test partner here, being a passed hand |pg||
nt|josj: defence can take 4 tricks at most on this layout|pg||
nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||
nt|richie: honestly I have no idea - I am not in Albena|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith rebid 1nt on the same auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|timve:  good contract, but normally going off|pg||
nt|richie: aha! for the juniors!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes ... :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  No more comments to-day - this is too much|pg||
nt|loe48: next|pg||
nt|timve:  two finesses off and missing @CAK|pg||
nt|timve:  this lead doesnt change a lot|pg||
nt|timve:  srr|pg||
nt|richie: makes more sense|pg||
nt|richie: this can go 3 down with maximum defence|pg||
nt|chick: @H10 right now|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Duck and give partner H ruff still beats it 2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|timve:  it does|pg||
nt|spenny80: the will play 5 without Qtrump|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well it seems this may make, but its not laydown|pg||
nt|richie: but I can imagine some disappointment, they had just one goal: GOLD|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|murat e: five level belongs to opponents someone said...|pg||
nt|timve:  now declarer can pitch a heart|pg||
nt|mrdct: understandably - south likes here hand|pg||
nt|2hplus4: No he can ruff C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankbo: tror simonsen hadde et uheldig motspill mot 1hj X|pg||
nt|timve:  on the 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|bebechira: Netherlands playing Sweden in the juniors.... 23-17 after 9|pg||
nt|chick: the @D trick is natural|pg||
pc|dT|nt|spenny80: 5@d asking Q@s|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now 12|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bebechira: that's for sure... very good team|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h needs @s 3-3 or 4-2 and @h 2-2-makes this time |pg||
pc|s3|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a club switch|pg||
nt|richie: @cT is more deceptive|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timve:  to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|timve:  a small one|pg||
nt|marionmi:  rehi, got kicked out|pg||
pc|s6|nt|doks: In Poland they play very similar version of these bids, except 2@H can contain spades as well|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, a relay auction found the 5-3 @s fit...it can be made if you play W to have all the @ss|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: better to test @D first, I would say|pg||
nt|richie: for me Wednesday will be a feast :)|pg||
nt|richie: would everyone pass  1NT with the east hand?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|spenny80: yes|pg||
nt|richie: rehi marion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|josj: goo defence...|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but it seems like i havent missed that muhc|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the other table N made a slamtry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bebechira: i think for the girls the head to head match will be the one|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N much easier|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|runnerup: no real chance if @s ace not well placed -so that make or sunks this|pg||
nt|antoniz: piêkne zagranie|pg||
nt|richie: @cT and another club, south will finally get 3 more diamond tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|richie: chalking up 9 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Padon will establish his spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|timve:  its surprising how quick the play is|pg||
nt|spenny80: but she has good cards in @c |pg||
pc|h8|nt|oosb: @D guess now |pg||
nt|oosb: doesnt know A@S vs A@D|pg||
nt|oosb: so this is tough|pg||
nt|uttam: but did not require @d guess, dec could find out about @s ace 1st|pg||
nt|richie: just 17 imps for poland|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a llady?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|oosb: I think he needs to play small anyway|pg||
nt|josj: and another deserved imp to the Azzurre|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And S tought w ruffing walues to play  @s|pg||
nt|kemperg: specs wanted a dbl and pass from N, risky|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Y. @SKQ and a @H shift.|pg||
nt|richie: maybe 10 when south is endplayed in any of the suits|pg||

mb|1D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: If trumps are 2-2, there is no ruff, if spades are 3-3, the 2nd spade ruff sets up the suit, then draw the last trump, and play a diamond now|pg||

mb|1D|nt|timve:  but with @HQx even 6NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|oosb: 3NT NS |pg||
nt|oosb: But East might have something to say in @S :)|pg||
nt|timve:  2@C with 22-24|pg||

nt|bebechira: Poland is the second last match|pg||

nt|bebechira: the open room settled in 6|pg||
nt|iceblue: its hard after 3@H|pg||
nt|richie: sweden is still 3rd but cannot afford too many bad boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  but @d has to be lead somewhere so may have more play than first glance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No 3NT now it appears|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him|pg||
nt|frankbo: hadde blitt vanskelig for Ø med 3 hj fra S|pg||
nt|timve:  this pair has a better solution|pg||
nt|timve:  they use Kokish|pg||
nt|timve:  2@H is natural or very strong NT|pg||
nt|spenny80: no, She can play @h finess or @s expass|pg||
nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With AK@h and a normal @c shift |pg||
pc|cK|nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That does not beat it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|doks: N still looking for 7 if 2@D dont deny 4controls|pg||
pc|cT|nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@S was a difficult bid to read safer to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: preempt worked in both rooms.. but|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S7 best now|pg||
nt|kemperg: but thats loses the controle, @C then for defenders|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
nt|bebechira: still 2 vps in front|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H must be cue, with shortness, as he deny @H support|pg||
nt|doks: but they must know better their aggreements|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E trying to force rather than going for ruffs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|richie: sweden 155, france 153, italy 149 (maybe they are the 3rd dog coming for the bone?)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No u right |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He then set up the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for N,, he wants to lead @d and @c at same time|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|loe48: ja er muligheter her|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3s-4d now|pg||
nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||
nt|richie: seems to be a push, same contract reached|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  trying to pull trumphs :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3-3 @s will see this one home|pg||

nt|frankbo: N vet ikke om H tilpassningen enda|pg||

nt|richie: 2 VPs is nothing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Pass always at team then Frank.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: So some national Polich players have left the Polich club it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke did not see the danger|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bebechira: Rosaline in 5d dbled in the closed|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|richie: 500 and 1 imp to france I guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2 imps|pg||
nt|richie: might be a swing to france again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't ruff 2 diamonds if they play another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he should have realised that and played on spades|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ouch to fast play here from his side|pg||
nt|richie: only  hope for Padon was the singleton honour in @s|pg||
nt|bebechira: Massimilliano in 5d in brd 9 so that will be flat|pg||
nt|eliran_a: good lead by delle cave , club lead give and the contract makes ,declerer needs to play J@c from dummy |pg||
pc|hA|nt|bebechira: may be 2|pg||
nt|chick: good forcing technique, duck until win dummy's last trump|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: unblock the @dA and then keep drawing trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: well I have electricity, but it is not working too well..|pg||
nt|bcmandal: if rkc 5c means?|pg||
nt|doks: another suggestion from speecs, Optional kick-back, with 4@S min, than its ok with answers|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|asig: Now declarer "just" needs to get the spades right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: oops|pg||
pc|dT|nt|2hplus4: Declarer squandered chances of dummy entries|pg||
nt|chick: well, he got his small trump after all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|timve:  if you find your 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|richie: good attempt, but won't succeed as north has the @hT with the free @sQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: ofcause KQ -doubleton ok too 2@h and 1 @s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|doks: optional kick-back, quite popular now in NED as I know|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankbo: hvis du melder 3sp og så 4hj tror jeg det må være sleminv i hj|pg||
nt|timve:  and you do a slemtry|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He could not reach the @s  so ofc he was always down with @C shift |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: may still lose @cA and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... and  east scored 10 in the open room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrdct: sorry the polish girls on that last one|pg||
mc|9|nt|asig: East should be alert and play low when a spade is led towards the dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: I agree with finess in @h....|pg||

nt|bjacobs: it's hard to buy, when you look at this deal, that's for sure|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Like when they have bid 3 suits and end up playing in the 4th|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@D  ;  1@H  1@S  ;   2@S   etc.|pg||

nt|vugraphpl5: sorry for this situation|pg||
nt|murat e: this type of hand difficult to evaluate make souths spade one more club one less and slam is on with a normal 3-2 trump break|pg||

nt|ntmon: such a splendid outcome ..|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||
nt|richie: partscore in @h probably|pg||
nt|doks: optional or not, next board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: small chance here as the other room was too timid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|richie: 5@s 5m|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: does anyone knows the NS sys? is this 4@Ss+5minor?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: thanks to all the kibitzers who confirmed|pg||
mb|4H|nt|loe48: we need some action here now|pg||

nt|bebechira: action here for sure lol|pg||
nt|richie: crazy hands this session :)|pg||
nt|chick: 3 ... a 7-card suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Enig Frank, etter reversen fra N. Stil og avtaler i makkerparet, men...|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Asia Krawczyk Taczewska: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=29688|pg||
nt|richie: aha, no, east can open 1NT first - will be playing 2@s|pg||
nt|doks: normal 2@H, must be duplicated here as well|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not?|pg||
nt|runnerup: some douthloking values in east but 4@h must be didden and makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
nt|richie: everyone passing? maybe 1@s - 2@c pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||
nt|bebechira: oops...she didn't|pg||
nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
nt|kemperg: I do, but dont see it much|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a push board , 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
nt|chick: yes, preempt bids are based on length and the Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess 2N is a @H raise, though I don't understand why not 2@S|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  me to :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
nt|chick: that's why making a weak 2 bid with a 7 card suit is silly|pg||
nt|chick: and why opening 4@S with a 7 card suit is dangerous|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT! that's again modest|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: kib suggests he's afraid of it being passed |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: since last board understandeble:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: anyway, this should make comfortably, and a small gain for israel|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the right plan was to ruff 2 @d and 2@s before pulling the trumphs and then palyed a@hJ and N was endplayed (from Johan Upmark)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't think your rigid views are mainstream|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dagold: he had to decide how likely it is pard has a good hand with clubs when holding Qxx himself. not so unreasonable to pass imo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ikke tid. Synd.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
nt|doks: Must leave right now. Big thanks for excellent company and valuable contribution from specs, was pleasure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here 2@h was 8-11|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||
pc|h9|nt|richie: problems are solved now, 9 tricks in the pocket|pg||
nt|chick: but they are based in good theory and work ...whether or not people use that theory correctly is up to them|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|richie: maybe if she manages to make 6 tricks they will win 1 imp :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: weired bidding as well|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  One should ask for unblock or count, the other for attitude|pg||

nt|chick: It works fine for the 4 level also, 5+ not so good|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankbo: den kl 3 kan lure begge spillerne|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal anyway is a hook in @H. No special signals.|pg||
nt|loe48: i mean draw spades and dias..look for possibilities..a hook is often to simple to just do|pg||
nt|loe48: you get valuable info|pg||
nt|loe48: that might make you change foot|pg||
nt|frankbo: drar han alle korta til bunns kan Ø kaste kl ess for ikke å bli innspillt|pg||
nt|loe48: da har han 12|pg||
nt|loe48: saa johansen..dra ned en trump til du|pg||
nt|spenny80: but with @h 4-3 is good slam...|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe pitch @dQ here to put some doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: well, maybe not if @C 4-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: not sure...|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be the same|pg||
pc|dA|nt|timve:  well no problems in 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: A board for Rana Avis Frank?|pg||
nt|loe48: well done Johansen!|pg||

nt|spenny80: do you make 2 suiter with E?|pg||

nt|marionmi:  heheh yes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|spenny80: bid|pg||
nt|josj: if Margherita can take action now...|pg||
nt|ntmon: surely worth it|pg||

nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think she will|pg||
nt|marionmi:  then 3@s-5@d?|pg||
nt|richie: that would shut out NS bidding completely |pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, 1@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 nt in open room |pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosb: Another example of a pushy dbl|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes, but isn't mp|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's easier to adapt your bidding methods than give away your years |pg||
nt|mrdct: some goods 10s and 9s|pg||
nt|richie: horrible hands!! they open multi and EW face these hands... |pg||
nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky this time, happens, but EW had a 6@D slam too|pg||

mb|1S|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the contract here|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||
nt|marionmi:  into doubling them?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer X with all points outside|pg||
nt|chick: by the way, the LoTT for preempts assumes that partner has his fair share of the remaining cards in the suit.  In that hand, it didn't happen|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Then does the LOTT not work if partner does not do his bit by contributing a massive dummy? :)|pg||
nt|chick: massive not required, two spades would have helped a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: in other room netherlands girl think as me|pg||
nt|ntmon: may die out at 5@S|pg||
nt|richie: well bid |pg||

mb|2H|nt|frankbo: hehe|pg||
nt|oosb: But then again, I'm never opening this 1@C|pg||
nt|josj: should not be too difficult to locate @CQ|pg||
nt|josj: E will be known to hold 5-5-2-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 2 suiter in est and seeing 2@s in E, Q@c can't pay|pg||

nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||
nt|richie: then you should pass again|pg||
nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I like 1@H ni the other room more than I like 2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In copen room Lothan said pass|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
nt|antoniz: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||
nt|spenny80: but here is the same|pg||
nt|spenny80: normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably the same outcome if south did open|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
nt|richie: north never showed her extra values, 3NT will be the end|pg||
pc|h7|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||
nt|murat e: some spec suggests 2 dia instead of 2 sp but matchpoint bidding is not that way|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @S is best |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And now padon has takaway NS suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 1 too much |pg||
pc|h2|nt|timve:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|timve:  if declarer takes in her hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: good lead|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal bid of 3@s by west and a good lead by north whice means the contract gonna fail by 1 trick|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||

pc|dT|nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||
nt|bebechira: you went quiet Richard ?|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in the meanwhile makes comfortably|pg||

nt|richie: @dQ on the K :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c pitch seems automatic, whether W can ruff or not|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|richie: Q is an alarming card, 9 still too vague|pg||
nt|marionmi:  spangenberg wont think her partner has 5 diamonds, so i think she should play the queen to show something weird is going on|pg||
nt|marionmi:  9 might also be neutral from Q9x|pg||
nt|richie: unlucky @c break dooms the contract|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The @C8 lead was sensible in a way ... protecting against partner having singleton @CQ: but it really was the wrong suit|pg||

nt|richie: Magdalena has to switch to a @d to set the contract (at least not spade)|pg||
nt|bebechira: i just typed ...diamond 2 now|pg||
nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: North in 4h in the open room...|pg||
nt|rensph: Operator, could you check result for board 12 after play?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yep, must be|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Seems like only 3 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: North can't prevent the fourth diamond from being ruffed - his clubs are too small|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 of @c makes a ruff j and 9 both in south true|pg||
nt|bebechira: good contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 diamonds and spade to give ...probably|pg||
nt|bebechira: well done|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  One more round to-day|pg||
nt|murat e: 520 beats this one if any...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You might see the lead in board 14 this way: Chance for more than 1 trick = @C-lead|pg||
nt|oosb: North should not have passed.|pg||
nt|oosb: Stuck for a bid I wouldve chosen 3@C|pg||
nt|oosb: Or dbl.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with everything behaving, should make 5@h|pg||

nt|runnerup: if decl..doent guess @h -he is off because no squeze exist|pg||
pc|c3|nt|timve:  well defended|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  my thought to|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: except the info that south had to lead from Qxx which means he didn't have anything more attractive|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so there is a clue about the hearts then|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

nt|spenny80: W can play a 4th round in @h... I hope no|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry red suits ..yes makes even then ..so opening lead was critical|pg||

mb|5H|nt|spenny80: 2@d minimum w/o 4@h|pg||

nt|spenny80: 2@s 4+@d|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3imps are 3 imps... it is a gain :)|pg||
nt|richie: west has a small powerhouse, but in green no need to risk for a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d by E now?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now N could bid 4@d|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and he did|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Thats not easy to double|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now birman should know 3@H was not junk so maybe 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: It's a bors for NT, 2 or 3 is little difference|pg||
nt|josj: hoping all the tens will come in, Fabio?|pg||
nt|spenny80: and with 3 10 i prefer more 3nt|pg||
nt|richie: normal 4h but no chance after the excellent diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
nt|richie: 3@cX = I want to lead this suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level here |pg||
nt|richie: funny thing is that every VP has double the value|pg||
nt|eliran_a: good 5@h by dror|pg||
mb|d|nt|asig: But may be hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: ja, systemet er ikke saa godt at de faar vist trumf 10|pg||
nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
nt|bebechira: french girls in 2s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Right end.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W has shown 17 + and with E 2@d is FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
nt|richie: easy board|pg||
nt|marionmi:  pretty risky 3@s bid by north :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead, still Ticha will make at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Häxan in Sweden I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
nt|richie: VERY comfortable!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: but after this good lead, you may need it|pg||
nt|runnerup: needs @s lead fo -2|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like +100 for N-S as they can make 5@c|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman is thinking maybe to correct it to 5@s |pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 5@h both @d and @s lead from N are 2 down for +300|pg||
nt|bebechira: 8 more imps for Italia on brd 13|pg||
nt|runnerup: -1 seems normal because @s lead is too difficult to find|pg||
nt|bebechira: Alon still there...ar is he getting water|pg||
nt|runnerup: for those who thinks @d lead is ok -north playes small first round and -1|pg||
mb|5S|nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||

mb|p|nt|dagold: Israel playing in 1@c on 14 after east didn't respond|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s it is|pg||
nt|richie: french will grab extend their lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But they played not the normal one. 2@c is either any strong or 14-16 w 6+@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 7 tricks and has to decide between @s and @d were the 8th and 9th are coming from|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@s in open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see a route to nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||
nt|spenny80: but better than 5@d|pg||

mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about 3 when looking at @CK|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  We saw it come...|pg||
nt|frankbo: they did lead H against 6sp so easy to make|pg||
nt|marionmi:  note that west also started with a quiet pass over 3@d there, hoping for a misunderstanding |pg||

mb|5S|nt|richie: for 3NT to succeed you need @dA singleton or doubleton|pg||
nt|rensph: Declarer may choose to finesse in spades now, before giving up a heart trick. There's a danger of being shortened in trumps otherwise.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3H is fine by me. Max room for exploration and if partner wants to play in D you have a good card|pg||

nt|timve:  this board the Italians were saved by the bell|pg||
nt|timve:  or by a block in the spades|pg||
nt|timve:  think the Dutch played better. Especially since 13 imps of the Italians came from a lucky slem|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: he has more than he promised|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 5th @S, 5-5 generally good shape, even @D king might be a trick if partner has xx|pg||

nt|rensph: we're taught to lead trumps against doubled partscores, as specs point out. No different here.|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: if north doesn't know he has a fit, then X is clear|pg||
nt|runnerup: but down it goes like that also -because north didnt trust fo sing q -in clubs|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dagold: yes. impressive set from the EW pair here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stil neg X also at that level by those bids.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this is not the best EW contract|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: X must show @Hs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Or responcive as well|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and this X is support I guess|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: nice stop in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so well stopped bye Isr in 3@h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  to slow|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: if a @H fit were established, north could X for an invite|pg||
mb|3C|nt|2hplus4: NS bidding seems strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: as a spec points out, had the other table reached 6NT on the last board the extra undertrick would've cost 7 imps. They'll be happy to hear they stopped in 3.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but south doesn't know of a fit yet, so north can't X (probably pen)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  S dbl 3 @h ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  wow, our first 1 level contract...players must be tired.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1 Nt open also but E misgused @d|pg||
nt|rensph: meanwhile the other table had a misunderstanding and played in a 4-1 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: That was costly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rensph: 4@H looks like one loser in each suit, provided you get the trumps right|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: likely another pickup for israel|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  otherwise you cant double on S hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|loe48: he will bid 5h, but they never get to balancebid like now|pg||
nt|rodal f: A tricky small @D?:)|pg||
nt|loe48: it just get a shot in blind|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d makes -and they will bid it also after this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|2hplus4: 10 tricks now if he gets H correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Done|pg||
mb|p|nt|eliran_a: nice bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|loe48: normal play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this can make on DD play|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: @D to dummy, @H queen, put E in with the @H jack, then play the @S queen and finesse east's jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: that 4 @c here even thow was 2 tricks too high was worth 9 imps -because ew bid valuntairy to 5 @c -duly doubled -3 in other table|pg||
nt|twcho: tks you too. :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well deserved swing to Serbia. 6@D is an excellent slam|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes lillte easier now when  has seen @c suit |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: this is looking like -2 however|pg||
nt|chick: This is another point where I differ with conventional wisdom ... I think leading Q from QJx(x) is a loser about 80% of the time|pg||

nt|eliran_a: thx a lot ! my pleasure|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel still 18 VPs in front and almost impossibile to catch.. the Israeli kids had a great tournament|pg||
nt|runnerup: and last board looks like a hard 3nt -makes luckyly |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chick: I kept some statistics on that particular lead for about 6 months in vugraph play, and it turned out well about 20% of the time. |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well thanks all, with apolgies for my internet provider...|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 9 tricks here in 3nt with a lot of luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: 2@h -dont ask?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dan_ehh: I think it's Padon's famous pass more than Birman's famous 4@S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eliran_a: 2@h = 4 spades with 10+ hcp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|2hplus4: Leading partner's suit is my favourite lead Even C|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: And he will be severely punished|pg||
nt|chick: I agree that when partner bids a suit, it's different. |pg||
nt|runnerup: North bid only 1nt to 1 @h and they never found @d |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|runnerup: one critical board off thsi match was where ns has 4-4 in @s and good lookong 6@s -here it was 3nt -other table found 4-4 @s but for some reason played 6 nt instead off 6 @s -and ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: lost 12 instead off winning |pg||
