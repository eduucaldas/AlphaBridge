nt|poohbear: Lets see if North gets  " busy " in 3rd seat fav|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi SiSito|pg||
nt|eleni: last:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|riccho:  we all made revokes. THe difference is in handling the situation afterwards|pg||
nt|vasmar: slam depending on diamond finesse if played by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|basu_4139: clearly a Michael|pg||

nt|runnerup: perhaps 4 @d is forcing and good cards -so either pass and take all hates of your patrner -and try to explain some stupid -i did nt have for my 1nt --or bid 5 like a man|pg||
nt|poohbear: but what do I know :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: *bid|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|Gerben42:  hmm i wonder what 2@C was|pg||

mb|d!|nt|Gerben42:  probably @C or not @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now showing @D+M|pg||

nt|loe48: white colors..3c okay ...but 5c from partner now...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friendly layout.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: South shows game inviting values - some of us elders may have considered this a 2@H raise |pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  A sporty 1 Nt bid here ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shows (very) weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 620/650 is on, so 500 is OK|pg||
mb|3D|nt|loe48: look like 500, 3 down with a fast view|pg||

nt|smirny: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  West made an aggressive Dbl of 1NT and will be happy to get -1|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Zimmermann will be surprised dummy has everything|pg||
nt|smoller: 4 down unless defence helps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  father|pg||

mb|p|nt|andy_h: E-W lead 3rd-5th in trumps too? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  guess so|pg||
nt|smirny: is it better to lead 2nd/4th in trumps|pg||
nt|smirny: ?|pg||
nt|smirny: i think it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West would dbl takeout over 4@d|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Gerben42:  maybe better is small?|pg||
nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: but doesnt want to lose to singleton Ace in East|pg||

pc|h5|nt|andy_h: The standard lead for a trump (opening) lead is usually small because you never know if any of your big trumps can be promoted (you never know!). But otherwise if they are actually ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: useless or of equals then you can use them as suit-preference signals|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad board for my poor DK anyway - they didÂ´nt make 4 @S in OR...?|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting that Schwartz plays a @c now. Cant be right unless partner falsecarded|pg||

nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||

nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||

nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||

nt|vasmar: previous board was a disaster for Italy|pg||

nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@S in EW fails on a number of ruffs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|riccho:  I dont like the 2@h bid. shape misdescription is generally not a good idea in hands with slam potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had E bid 2@D and then @H, it was possible. Lets see.|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet hollandalýlar genelde transfer oynuyorlar acýþtan sonra|pg||

nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||

nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||
nt|ady: down 2 around 2  if they find the club ruffs|pg||
nt|rensph: @DQ overtaken, returning a club.... looks like down 2?|pg||
nt|riccho:  filigrane|pg||
pc|d6|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree.|pg||
nt|eleni: right Richard|pg||
nt|riccho:  Its sheer luck that 7@s is not an obvious contract |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||

nt|rnmalik: OR also.E bid 2@D and then @H but @S the contract.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@s is a terribly contract and would have failed if the @s are not playable for zero loser. |pg||
nt|riccho:  swo its a 5 or 7 Hand in @s|pg||

nt|atalok: cl atagýna veya dönüþüne batabilir|pg||

nt|rnmalik: @S 3/3, lucky contract.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||

nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||

nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
nt|yusufb: celik 2nt demesi lazýmdý|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||

nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||

nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
nt|vasmar: this can be a crucial board|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult bidding though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@d seems cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: and 7 if you ruff 2 clubs or make 3@S tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||

nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
nt|eleni: oooooooooooops a passive bid|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think 4NT by N should be more accurate|pg||

nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||

mb|p|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||

mb|6D|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||
nt|rodal f: It often use to be right when NS are vul and EW not|pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead makes difficulties |pg||
nt|ady: now the Queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Artur already played for Norway, in the Nordic Championships recently|pg||

nt|athene: ok, i guess west decided that with @HAQ @CA @DK east was not just bidding 4@H over 3@S|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Ish Delmonte preferred bidding 1Nt to bidding the very weak @h suit, which might be passed out in a 5-1 fit. I prefer @H myself, but I can see all 52 cards. |pg||
