mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  on this lead, 3NT is easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -ew has 5 @h/east !!  and 5 @d will come -for down 1 -but perhaps 5 @h makes in practise by west also|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|kaapo: Italy 2nd after R15, as they have been for the most of the tournament. Finland now 16th|pg||

pc|h7|nt|eleni: I am sorry 3rd round|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
nt|kaapo: A quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco might have promised stronger hand than this with his bidding, or might be just normal youngsters friskines on both parties|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they need a good win now if they want to chalenge Israel....good for moral as well|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry, choæ w Polsce ma³o pogodny:)|pg||

nt|famus: I presume 3@ds was routine rev bergen|pg||
nt|zebutin: Sadly i don't know anything about italian pair, Kytömaa&Vallivaara are both students in university of Oulu|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eleni: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|bmkl: same as in open tbl|pg||
nt|arigun: @s mecuber 1 tur daha boslayacak 10 love olacak|pg||
nt|stevedr: good defense for -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good switch not giving declarer a chance to make:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
nt|rado: declarer might produce 9 tricks but brobably defence will be 1st with 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: E playing 1NT in the open room....|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we will start with a swing...|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand young superstar Madala is playing, who has played almost every round of the tournament|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand = other room|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||
nt|dkkello: Yes but still some work to do|pg||
nt|runnerup: a little suprice that ns didnt bid 5 @d|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Terve|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankbo: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, a bit passive|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of work for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: now declarer seems to have 2@D+2@S+3@C+@H eventually, and then opponents have setting trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be too much work :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: now @H to discard later @D|pg||
nt|bagman: Kytömaa's opening was a bit on the light side considering the position and vulnerability but he's not going to be badly punished|pg||
nt|runnerup: so there was one good point from east activeness -there are in -bad point is that this is -1 -still can no big lost |pg||

nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Frank Bogen and Liu Jing|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H looks normal here - unless NS end up in trouble|pg||
nt|panosk: tough spots in @C for S tou discourage if they play udca|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 2@H in the OR was takeout I assume        North simply decided to convert|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|runnerup: only partials here -even thought -4 @s doens seem so bad |pg||
nt|famus: Hi Liu Frank|pg||
nt|frankbo: hi there|pg||
nt|liujing: hi|pg||
nt|rado: maybe after Smolen W might bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|stevedr: with good def this can go -6|pg||
nt|stevedr: but probably to hard again|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
nt|liujing: this must be an important match|pg||
nt|liujing: 2nd(ITA) against 3rd(DEN)|pg||
nt|zebutin: something like that might give chance for it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and not does S wake up?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  S has an easy 6@h now?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yep with hearts 3-3 is ok for 10 it seems|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: hi to everyone|pg||

nt|lady007: NS also have some chances in 5@d played by north. but it wont make today|pg||
nt|dkkello: He will make i comfort witout a @S lead i think|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
nt|famus: the current standings are such that it can go to the wire in the final rounds:srael -275. Italy -261, Denmark -235, France -230. Norway -225, Croatia-221|pg||

nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||

nt|liraren: with the first pass u can bid 2 @d with that kind of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: site for results http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||
nt|frankbo: no makes without D|pg||
nt|veistikke:  4@s, 4@h, and 5@c make. lets see where they get :P |pg||

pc|d4|nt|eleni: hi Dennis|pg||
nt|famus: uh-uh|pg||
nt|liujing: he can manage 3 @D after a finesse|pg||
nt|famus: no more lest he plays a low|pg||
nt|liujing: now Tofte is safe and he can take care for his 4 winners|pg||
nt|frankbo: strange play|pg||
nt|frankbo: A in D|pg||
nt|famus: u have to wait till he plays the nxt card|pg||
nt|liujing: but reasonable if Qx/Jx @S in west|pg||
nt|liujing: anyway low @S from east is a good switch|pg||
nt|famus: no hope now|pg||
nt|zebutin: and spade suit is quite lucky with singelton J, especially when Di Franco bid it|pg||
nt|veistikke:  -1 |pg||

nt|runnerup: @d would have been better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: West has no entries for a double @d finesse now|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lie very friendly so maybe even 7@H|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|eleni: now Q@s will give Stankovic  his discards|pg||

nt|zebutin: ending was interesting, could have played @H suit at the end and maybe have something good come up...|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems here is another 3nt, this time most likely making with 3@C+ 4@S+@D and 1-2 @H tricks...with @D lead might make even more diamond tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: that 5 @h -contract was the same-lead the same but +1 in other room -strange -so 13 for Israel|pg||
nt|runnerup: lucky 4 @s here |pg||
nt|daman: very lucky|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
nt|liraren: natural weak 2@d|pg||
nt|ybob: X and over suit at low level, bids @D |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most teams playing in 3N board 3 it seems|pg||

mb|2H|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||

nt|stevedr: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 piki skurczybyki|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: Missing all TOP honours , I would definitely hesitate to Open a weak two in first seat  |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden seems to have given up strong club and shifted to this system instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes its the new swedish club ;)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||
nt|ybob: pass works fine to collect 200|pg||
nt|ybob: and probably down 1 in 4m|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla will pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
nt|panosk: E unbloched the 10@S 1st round of spades so dummy spades were good, only 1 entry needed then|pg||
nt|daman: good bid by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead from N? i might prefer passive @S|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D pictures most likely behind declarer, Jx doesn't look promising, and A10x isnt going anywhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: or thats my thinking on lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: these yuongsters just bids those games|pg||
nt|daman: fearless|pg||
pc|hA|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||
nt|rado: French top player Alain Levy recommends to seek for Major lead when unbid Majors at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: interesting lead|pg||

nt|friggi: 1@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, I believe EW use 3rd/5th leads so @D2 is usually from 5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||

nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||

nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
nt|zebutin: but then J could cover, if singelton honor takes it 654 against H3 is enough|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: nothing fancy in the end: declarer likely to make his 8 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: running scores are here|pg||
nt|ntmon: first IMPs for CZ|pg||
nt|ntmon: you could not win when you won't bid games|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have the major fits to maybe cause problems here|pg||
nt|possessed: 5cl seems cold, but lets see if they can bid|pg||
nt|ntmon: hard to reach  |pg||
nt|tejjyid: "6 decent cards in a pleasant hand" is a good description (probably not acceptable in the ACBL)|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|offthebend: only 3 imps tho - deserve more than that |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  only 3 imps, but it should have been 5 for denmark|pg||
nt|timve:  hello all|pg||
nt|lady007: hi Tim|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Tim|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 2 was played in 4 spades making all 22 times|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with 16 HCP and stiff @s ,  would have doubled for sure so no finesse against J @s |pg||
nt|ybob: S showed A@S KJ @H A@D and K@C, with A@S stiff not bid pass over 3@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: wery good result for F in open here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  or some FG hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is 15+9 balanced hands worth game?|pg||
nt|jkotor: frajerski tryk :(|pg||
nt|antoniz: niestety|pg||
nt|jkotor: S mia³ graæ kiera po K@s, widne karty|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ko co przewidzieæ:(|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale rozdanie nie bêdzie raczej przegrane|pg||
nt|runnerup: so north miscounted -was home and down he went |pg||
nt|panosk: was greedy|pg||
nt|daman: and now an easy 4@H contract|pg||
nt|daman: Hungary needs action to move up in the standings (or down )|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: niewa¿ne - ale puszczenie lewy w oczywistej sytuacji chwa³y nie przynosi|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d by south I guess|pg||
nt|ahri:  (almost) misfit distributive hands, this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  East was squeezed on  3 - nice play by Giampetro on that one|pg||
nt|ritong: south has to invite|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural 2NT seems to match his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it'sa whole lot of losers, but too many points to do less|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great bid,the natural 2NT|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might end in 3NT here; down with a spade lead and make if declarer can get 9th trick from diamonds in time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  it all depends on how do you agree what 3@h is here. some play it forcing, some play it constructive NF, I don't find any of those "wrong" :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c is GF relay|pg||
nt|lady007: wild board|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi 3nt sorunsuz oluyor diyecgim gen olmayacak|pg||
nt|arigun: ne dersin yusuf ? :)|pg||
nt|stevedr: 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: an over-ambituous 3NT:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  west is quite aggressive and unpredictable. I know that best, he's my ex partner :)|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||
nt|dkkello: Denmark with a great oppertunity here|pg||
nt|ybob: clear slam |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  U have the same problem if u bid 1@h nat and opps bid 3@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: With 4-4 you can double using standard methods|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open|pg||
nt|bagman: 15-17 + 9 is always a game|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt forcing 2@d|pg||
nt|daman: and Italy need a win|pg||
mb|2H|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 2 only Romania in closed room bid and made 6c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||
nt|eleni: a tricky lead of small !g can keep them off slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||
nt|eleni: !g|pg||
nt|eleni: THX Todor dear for the explanations:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but east should have taken @DA earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: after the @c lead, is a claimer|pg||
nt|lady007: seems like NS are back on natural bidding now, after the overcall |pg||
nt|timve:  3NT by south?|pg||
nt|lady007: Wouldnt 3@d show 5/5 now?|pg||
nt|timve:  I think so|pg||
nt|lady007: not sure i want to play 3N with the south hand then|pg||
nt|timve:  but in diamonds you know the wrong hand will play|pg||
nt|arigun: guney tarafinda @d atagini 9 lu ezilirse aliriz defans 3@d+1@h alir ezmezse boslariz |pg||
nt|zebutin: really wd for romania then|pg||
nt|runnerup: south counting if a slam can exist|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mamos: everyone cuebidding :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||
nt|chrisky: it promisses fit in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
nt|yusufb: :)|pg||
nt|rado: strange to buy contract at 2@D at other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@c forcing 2@d*|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@s=4@h|pg||
nt|kaapo: This looks like puppet stayman|pg||

mb|4H|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@c gazzilli 2@d 8+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 4@S looks normal here unless West falls too deeply in love with the void|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing special here -10 now and + some|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: promising 1st or 2nd round control in @hs|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@h means " all was natural"|pg||
nt|veistikke:  much imps for sweden|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt=min no 4@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for france|pg||
nt|zebutin: needs to quess @H right to have any chance at this... when J or Q drops its much better odz that  Rubino has other honor...but then you are always losing 1 @H trick|pg||
nt|panosk: y matter of overtrics now, he shudnt try for too many :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer plays low and there's no good move for W|pg||
nt|jkotor: ta jest panie komendancie !|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: When was the Häxan convention invented, Johan, do you know?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Was it before or after Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if defence would have started with 3 @D rounds, then 5 @H tricks would maybe have been enough|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: EW  have done their job   hopefully their teammates can do theirs|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s lerden batýramayýz antrede yok ortakta puan ve @d var|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eleni: French courtesy to pd:) Lorenzini is a young gentleman:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this makes 4 @s seems good idea from ew -but  they were never inn bidding|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi @h pasi emniyetli|pg||
nt|yusufb: merhaba tekrar|pg||
nt|tez: çift @d empasý yaparak yapabilir|pg||
nt|tez: yusuf hoþgeldin:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: hoþbulduk tezcan:)|pg||
nt|tez: kozlara batýnýn kart atmasý zor|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer sets now a spade trick and hopes that the defense sets him a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: Then he would have 9 tricks without relying on clubs|pg||
nt|stevedr: my god|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vasmar: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello: This wont take long , though Niclas Ege is a very carefull player ( slow) :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: yes and he would have bid his @c suit after 2NT ( probably by transfert ) |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No after  i think|pg||
nt|veistikke:  3!n dbl W/E other room |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kaapo: He's probably questioning very carefully about EW's lead methods|pg||
pc|s9|nt|possessed: a deserved 11 imp|pg||
nt|offthebend: S has done well not to bid his Club suit which may help declarer play the D's right |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eugenio123: just @c swithc to fail 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit over the top! |pg||
nt|sybarra: other room |pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: Häxan ("witch") is the Swedish cousin of Gazzilli|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think it was Catarina Midskog who invented that one in the swedish way|pg||
nt|kaapo: It shows either a strong hand or long major|pg||
nt|galois85: I don't know that convention, any reference online?|pg||
nt|kaapo: While Gazzilli shows either clubs or a strong hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No NS plays like that way but the ordinary way in sweden is to play it lika Gazilli|pg||

nt|mamos: ok in 5@d  not so in 6@d|pg||
nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
nt|liujing: is 4@H too fast here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: You never know when playing against Finns :)|pg||
nt|bagman: some players cannot play the 9 from Q9; he needed just 3 club tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: well everything is possible|pg||
nt|zebutin: so score almost even|pg||
nt|bebechira: he needed to guess the hearts after the spade switch|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4d the limit here|pg||
nt|zebutin: 5@D seems like youthfull bidding at the other room|pg||
nt|zebutin: or -l there|pg||

nt|daman: need a precise bidding system|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gmarco24: Q was a nice card for the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Magnus Lindqvist tecah that to Midskog i've heard from the Audince|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||

nt|liujing: I might open with east's hand|pg||
nt|bambik: niezwykle trafnie 1ba|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Mr.Grosset maybe never heard of 8 ever, 9 never:):) (too young for it:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: 1@h over X shows a good suit|pg||
nt|lady007: E trying to double NS out of slam :)|pg||
nt|lady007: not that they will bid it anyway|pg||
nt|lady007: i dont like that double so much|pg||
nt|frankbo: me too|pg||
nt|liujing: 5 ctrls|pg||
nt|famus: is this a begenish response?|pg||
nt|famus: bergenish*|pg||
nt|bebechira: norway-denmark 14-0 after 4 brds so 18-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: South will most likely TRF, and leave it|pg||
nt|chrisky: 3nt for ns here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W make 3@S and N-S 3@h|pg||
nt|offthebend: North had to bring in the D suit for S to even think of slam anywhere -- with his poorish opening bid |pg||
nt|lady007: you mainly have a lot of spade tricks|pg||
nt|tez: 3@s deseydi güney gitmiþlerdi kesin|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes and if you loose 1 @H like mostly -you can loose no @c or @d|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT was a MP bid imo|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: 4@S to|pg||
nt|arigun: ama sasar yanilir key card sorarsa ortagindan 5@s i gecen bir cevap geliyor|pg||
nt|kaapo: Riccardo's 1NT looks a little odd having opened light|pg||

pc|s8|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||

nt|yusufb: K cekerse yapar|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested passing 1@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
nt|jkotor: graj¹ idealnie, tylko jako nie pamiêtam, ¿eby ostatnio co wygrali :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³y czasy, ¿e brali i wówczas byli najlepsi na wiecie|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe he wants to make it harder for EW to balance|pg||
nt|zebutin: which would seem reasonable with (sub)minimum opening|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like same score at this room|pg||
nt|bebechira: flat board... Di Franco chose not to take the money|pg||
nt|jkotor: sekwencja inwitowa i zapiera uzgodniony w licytacji ci¹gnik|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
nt|tez: 5@h diyecek..6 ya gelecekler|pg||

nt|friggi: this will make|pg||
nt|galois85: double dummy this can be make|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like comfortable make, so some more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The cards are nicely with @H 3-3, @S 3-2 and both rounded suit aces onside|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||
nt|bebechira: influenced by the vulnerability for sure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|arigun: ilk baord'dan anladigimiz kadariyla KG midi Nt oynuyorlar 12-14 civari birsey|pg||

nt|kaapo: A couple of @C ruffs should do it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  see if the bidding helps him to do that|pg||
nt|galois85: sice spades are 3-3 one can just lose I spade, 3 diamonds and the club... |pg||
nt|friggi: decl must asume that @C are 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah well, maybe it needs getting the clubs right to avoid promotions|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer just needs to capitalize his good luck|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||

nt|bagman: Looks also normal to go down in 4@H|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W might sacrefise in 4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to land in 4 @H here |pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has chances -best defence baets but can be home if best not found|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||

nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||

nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobry wist na -1|pg||

nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||

nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||

nt|runnerup: this time just  take all from top -basic curs +1 :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||

pc|dA|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
nt|runnerup: it was too greedy to open here 4. seat|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||

nt|lady007: over 2@s, north will surely bid 2N and he might raise to 3 then|pg||
nt|timve:  well you can bid 2@S, but will you pass 2NT by partner? knowing you probably have a heartfit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well thats good defence...|pg||

nt|runnerup: 1nt could have had better chance |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: yusuf gelmeden düzelteyim:)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahri:  quite distributive set this is|pg||
nt|pinticus: only 1 round today for juniors|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, certainly the best option for standard players|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C is much better than 3NT |pg||
nt|friggi: Det kan godt være men vi skal snakke engelsk, skal vi ikke?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: 12+12 BAL is often a game|pg||
nt|kaapo: However with @Cs 3-3 and hearts as they are, declarer might come to 9 at NT|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT in the OR    making 4    the defense led a @D and not a @H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chrisky: a slam in @H or @C for ew|pg||

nt|tejjyid: it's also becoming the standard option for the best players|pg||
nt|cicus: nice shift  of word order :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 3nt de|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt küçükler @c @h yani|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense needs to attack the spades in time to beat 3NT|pg||
nt|zebutin: good morning Andrea|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Andrea|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D even more|pg||
nt|cicus: unfriendly lie of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||
nt|timve:  but the spadelead seems normal, the clublead doesnt|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@c ye pas düsünülemez bile|pg||

nt|mamos: wrong again  forgot to allow for NS lol|pg||
nt|eleni: nah Mike! Michaels coid in @d asks for a slam|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s bid made the bidding even easier|pg||
nt|eleni: void I meant:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@H much, much more :)|pg||
nt|pinticus: X by E shows strong hand,3@d shows limit 5@h4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  two keycards missing here|pg||
nt|vasmar: double is dangerous|pg||
nt|offthebend: but does he gain anything out of it ?:)|pg||
nt|liraren: south X is transfer to @s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  tough call for north now, it's probably not clear that 3@c would be forcing|pg||
nt|dkkello: not my style |pg||
nt|arigun: 3nt ye kamaz zannetmem en azinda 4@h -2 iyi baraj|pg||

nt|andreasw:  3@c not force?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na kolejne m-stwa trzeba opodatkowaæ zawodników za puszczane w ordynarny sposób lewy i kontrakty|pg||
nt|runnerup: no -pass was not what i expected-many here opens norths card|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kaapo: This bidding looks very natural - maybe that's why they alert the calls :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eleni: (sorry everyone for my typing:) I never qualified as a secretary:):))|pg||
nt|mamos: well done fellow commentators and Greek EW  (though I think French NS helped a bit :))|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  +50 was still worth 5 imps for Germany|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but may be caused a problem, this may head for 3N|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can access live scores by clicking on either JUNIORS or YOUNGSTERS|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nah, Italians usually have some fancy stuff, so this may only appear natural|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead is good start for defence|pg||
nt|stevedr: 3clubs shows 4s and 5+ clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: no idea|pg||

nt|tez: tam olacak 3@s ..@h dam ataðýýndan sonra|pg||
nt|ahri:  diamonds behaving, heart ten dropping early|pg||
nt|eleni: a save to 7@d would win, as E-W have no 7@hs with a @s lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 5@h4@d*|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czego siê czepiacie jednej lewki...to tak jak ze stowy wydawaæ grosza reszty|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  good call, he knows @c king onside and just hopes for an entry in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: but he may need two entries if Kxx of Club is with W and S has to have at least 2 cards in Clubs |pg||
nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
nt|juan lukas: the 2@h opening helps EW to bid 5@d |pg||
nt|dkkello: 2 C!  maybe artificiel? dont know|pg||
nt|ybob: probably Gazzilli|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D alerted ?|pg||
nt|runnerup: he bid 4 @d here also -perhaps some 5-5 showing bid ..-this will loose in practice|pg||
nt|arigun: ama ondan sonra 3nt  nasil desinki tek @h le bati|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4koz 8 onor doubleton sadece 1 seviye yukseltcek slem solemicekti ve bunu devamlý yapýyolar |pg||
nt|stevedr: nf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we might see 3 @D |pg||

nt|mamos: Im not sure N should be even thinking of bidding after South thought for so long|pg||
nt|offthebend: sigh of relief -- he didn't get a Heart lead |pg||
nt|lady007: worst thing that can happen in junior bridge is when you miss game|pg||
nt|ybob: was natural :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: brave x for spade lead|pg||

nt|ntmon: E could have passed with his collection|pg||
nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|s6|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
nt|famus: duck|pg||
nt|liujing: a good lead but a bad duck here|pg||
nt|famus: shud b careful not to release @hA|pg||
nt|galois85: yes 3@c asking major. What would you lead in N?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see 6 tricks; AQ of hearts onside does not help; he needs to set up the clubs and prevent EW from cashing 2 spades|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  points for N/s now |pg||
pc|h4|nt|ntmon: raise to game is moot action even expecting partner a king stronger|pg||
nt|pinticus: yes,maybe W hoping for better @h suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: W could not be sure about the value of @SK at all |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so also 5@H here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: can see only S and W,the tray isnt here now|pg||
nt|cicus: where couple = 1 :) not allowing a club ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet still that @s bid deprived N-S from finding their slam|pg||

nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||
nt|frankbo: new imps for sweden|pg||
nt|yusufb: beklenmedik biþey dedi ne acaba|pg||

nt|kaapo: Sweden currently 8th with 244, needing 28 to catch up with France in 3rd place. If memory serves, 5 qualify for the world champs, Sweden is 20 VPs behind that|pg||
nt|panosk: they must be quite balanced for this kind of auction|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 5 @c defence has to pull twice trump very soon -this makes i think and ns has 5 @d without ruffs|pg||
nt|daman: I don't see the doom you do|pg||

pc|h2|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
nt|famus: The declarer mistimed his @D ruff in the last board--he shud ruff@D first and then return with @Hs--this can be a potential swing to Danes|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like nice pick up for finland|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Antti in the open room tried to prove he's a man by leaping to 4@S :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|ritong: when south " raises" @ds, it becomes clearer|pg||

nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||

pc|d4|nt|key1809: ping -pong, back to 500|pg||
nt|dkkello: very aggresive dbl. from the danish North in open room|pg||

nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose a spade, a club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the hearts on the @DK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in W in 6NT already|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||

nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||

nt|bagman: If N makes a help suit try in hearts, S has a very bad hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||

nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||

nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if can show shortness in diamonds and invite that way, not much better then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
nt|kaapo: In that case 5@C shows 1 or 4 keys... but maybe they weren't on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: must be the case|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||

nt|tez: 2/3 saniye düþünemeyecek miyim der selin|pg||
nt|arigun: perde de hesitasyon 20+ saniye kabul ediliyor bildigim adariyla|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So both player here thinks that they showed sometthing extras but partner didnt understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: Also facing a short suit trial in diamonds, S hand is not good for raise|pg||
nt|panosk: and therfore will go down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
nt|tez: perdeli oynanýyor maçlar..dolayýsýyla direktörler çok prim vermiyor ona|pg||
nt|kaapo: Somewhat strange as 4@D really looks like the ace to North|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
nt|tez: @h un birini yere çaktýrmak yeterli bu elde|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp gelecek|pg||
nt|tez: 10|pg||
nt|runnerup: some carefulness needed or 1 trick will disapear -for -1 only|pg||
nt|gio 89: bad news in @c for declarer unfortunately...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless ofcourse behinds a million imps and alot of imps needed:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s Q kuzeyde biliyo|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The problem here that 3@h doesnt show a superhand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjn: a little break now|pg||

nt|runnerup: and north didnt pass that test --low -to @d k|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|bebechira: 12?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Gerben42:  so lucky for Sweden that @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  otherwise would be 14 out|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now only 1|pg||
nt|timve:  this is the second match these two pairs play|pg||
nt|timve:  Helmich Hop seem out|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yusufb: hesitasyon:geç deklere vermek, beklemek, tereddüt etmek|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps North didn't realize the opening was from 3rd hand and took 2@S as a constructive raise|pg||
pc|c9|nt|veistikke:  1 imp for sweden|pg||
nt|gio 89: wrong choice by W|pg||
pc|c8|nt|offthebend: throw West in with last D and get last two clubs after cashin S and Heart to the K |pg||

nt|bebechira: Israel 'only' 11 VPS ahead at the moment|pg||

nt|garden2005: Fisher móg³ siê obroniæ ale dobrze dla nas, ¿e nie widzia³ wpustki|pg||
nt|panosk: Schwartz opted for the safe -1 quite rightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  after being demolished by the two huge favorites, Eggeling - Brinck have a strong performance here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes but remeber that "1d here was @h or trf to NT|pg||
nt|runnerup: north get trick back -unexpected just when communications were dead between ns|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dkkello: an even 6 @C is worth 2 imps!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, on to the next board. 2@C auctions can be tricky but luckily they are quite rare :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East's Diamond exit was deadly accurate here|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a flat board 4@s -2 v 6@s -2|pg||
nt|cicus: but it could not go away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 on a hook....or a pin|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Wich partscore to see?|pg||
nt|famus: all kinds of possibilities with E-W hands--if they stretch it --might get a bonus-|pg||
nt|famus: W shud add something for his !aq|pg||
nt|famus: @dAQ|pg||
nt|gio 89: EW wouldn't do too well in a @H part score, but may get away with -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@H in the other room at this point was a bit wet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  AK AK and support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and 6th @H|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he opts for a more noisy solution|pg||
nt|eleni: lololololo, yes too old in your early 20s:):)|pg||
nt|liraren: its not easy being operator , i am sure u do ur best :)|pg||
nt|timve:  I will bid 4@D with the easthand|pg||

nt|jkotor: to A@s, impas trefl i na trzeciego trefla wylecia³ przegrywaj¹cy kier a przebitka od lewy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42:  so another chance for Germany|pg||
nt|timve:  transfer to spades not sleminvitational|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe that means something different for this EW pair|pg||
nt|timve:  dont want my opponents get the chance to intervene|pg||
nt|gio 89: wise choice, in my opinion, from W to pass|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Seems enough by 3@D. Who knowes?|pg||
nt|ahri:  we started so well, with all boards providing some imps, let's hope we are done with pushes. It's junior bridge after all :)|pg||
nt|cicus: ok, I checked the movie|pg||
nt|ybob: good bid 3@S by E|pg||

nt|andreasw:  another board missing an ace and trumf K:) bid away guys;)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2nt is not enough!|pg||
nt|key1809: N-S can make 3nt here|pg||
nt|lady007: I'm sure he isnt planning not to bid game :)|pg||
nt|dkkello: 2@D=limit+ or better raise of clubs , 3 @S shows stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello: or will maybe  be an advance cuebid in a second when he bid 4 @C ?|pg||
nt|famus: probably asking for WHERE is help from E--wonder?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Might be another chance|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table seems bidding has stopped at 2@Sx|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
nt|famus: was this 2NT alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: no|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w 11 s¹ punkty ale niedu¿e...chyba ¿e znowu kto siê za wist zabierza|pg||
pc|dK|nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely 3 spades in other room was a singleton heart as suggested by 2 specs|pg||
nt|ybob: and 9 + cards m´s |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if it does show clubs why not play in them?|pg||
nt|dkkello: what to lead? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: any @d works |pg||
nt|yusufb: her ne olursa olsun bu elle 2@s acmak cok kotu|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can get 1100 but often defense drops a trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -north learned -1 nt this time (out of board 8)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: but south should've bid 3nt, not north|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd accept, he's a passed hand, and has Max for his pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Celik have told his hand well.|pg||
nt|ahri:  east showing concern about clubs|pg||
nt|dkkello: oops|pg||
nt|famus: if not alerted--then a gen game try|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: H lead wd have given declarer some thought, now it will be a claimer |pg||
nt|timve:  well they succeed getting it in the easthand|pg||

nt|famus: if he manages to ruff the 4th @D with @H he wud be home, wud have to manage this|pg||
nt|famus: @h9|pg||
nt|famus: now a @H is best|pg||
nt|famus: which Madala I'm sure wud work out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lady007: actually the best game is 3NT, but this will also make with the diamond finesse onside|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|key1809: generally, its not right to lead from an Ace, witha 4card suit, esp in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahri:  well bid. everything lies well on tihs board too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: indeed why not play in clubs here...6 clubs looks the same play as 3N on the non diamond lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timve:  hard to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|timve:  with these hands|pg||

nt|ritong: drijver: "sigh"|pg||
nt|offthebend: NOW N shd be brave enough to bid game in H |pg||
nt|timve:  1@H with north|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3@d makes without @c ruff -but can you bid|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club and a transfer to spades. The usual style in Sweden is that 1@S shows either minimum and 3-card support or weak NT and 2-3 support|pg||
nt|gio 89: the italians in or, scuse me|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: N should pass, if he doubles, S will remove and he does not want that|pg||

mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@Sx seems to be the contract they landed in|pg||

nt|zebutin: it is atleast a good try|pg||

nt|veistikke:  so 4-36 unless director was called for something. :P|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahri:  wow|pg||

mb|3S|nt|key1809: 2nt, starts of Leb,weak hands i presume|pg||

nt|ntmon: 6@C has the merit - it makes|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  exactly|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, wonder what 2@S would show from North|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably passed 2@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead was @H Q at other table...so most likely down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|key1809: he might be planning to s/o in 3c|pg||

nt|panosk: running scores here : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|gio 89: lets see if next few boards will bring us something a little more exciting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Pekka should have been more careful in his advice|pg||
nt|bebechira: the very important test between Englsnd and India starting soon...and looking at the preview I did not notice that in brd 13 Robert went down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|key1809: cl Q i mean|pg||
nt|eugenio123: interesting hand ! finally|pg||
nt|mamos: (through Greek pair in 4@H on 14 !!!!  4-2 |pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the hungarians have grinded it up|pg||
nt|famus: @c partial|pg||
nt|kaapo: When the @SA is no longer in the north hand, it's not any better time to lead the singleton...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland will be happy... a very good cricket match|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt|pg||
nt|veistikke:  it would hurt :P@@|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia o 16,30:)|pg||
nt|panosk: the real battle is for places 5-6 where even nineth team currently is with striking distance|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mamos: what a monster for East   - what NT range do we know?|pg||
nt|liraren: i have to go see y around|pg||
nt|yusufb: o yüzden maçlar 16 bordluk 2 devre olarak yapýlýyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu maçýn 2 devresi saat 16:20 de|pg||
nt|yusufb: bbo yayýný var|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes...should have said "don't lead @D, or play it after you have taken trick"|pg||
nt|bagman: true :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: dbl shows 4+@h here|pg||
nt|tez: niye pas der eren|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: I don't agree to open 1@d|pg||
nt|key1809: 6s/6nt there for the taking|pg||
nt|chrisky: an slam in the minors for ew|pg||
nt|ritong: be careful with 5332!|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  5@d as reached in the other room is the normal contract, and it is normal to go down one by finessing the diamonds|pg||
nt|tez: anlaþýlmaz..bu kadar temel biþey..dbl demedi|pg||
nt|yusufb: eren dikkat ettim elinde 9 puan olmadan konuþmuyor|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In open room did EW plays min nt 9-12HCP and thats why E easily could bid 1@s and not be worry to miss something|pg||
nt|kaapo: Anyhow, here we seem to have a perfectly natural 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H looks like a transfer to spades, maybe invite or better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wrong colours |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol..yea|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s out here is standard.. |pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 4@d is a good contract|pg||
nt|panosk: 5VPs , between 5 places|pg||
nt|runnerup: a good slam -best seems to be 6 @d /east but home also by west like is 6@h -6nt|pg||
nt|panosk: will they find it?|pg||
nt|panosk: .|pg||
nt|runnerup: east worried about many suits like @c -so maybe not|pg||
nt|panosk: pass by west wud be more helpfull but how can he ?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt -some misfit -some communication problems -something to guess but should make --here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not sure double was the way to go |pg||
mb|2N|nt|chrisky: i think 15-17|pg||
nt|ritong: the law has its limits|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, never scorig more than 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: 5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Did North pass in tempo?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here implies that he's made a mistake with the 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx|pg||
nt|cicus: why was 1@H alerted?|pg||
nt|ritong: mystery|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smell the cards and open 1@S and after pd's 2@c/1nt bid 3nt ;)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahri:  this is 21:9 for croats now if i am not mistaken, being on the "good" side of the VP scale for croats.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he said can be with 3 cards|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu pasýda kabul edilemez|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here 1D always unbal|pg||
nt|kaapo: With a weak hand 2@S is available|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H probably in multi-landy context showing a good overcall (my guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 7@s doesn't make last hand,only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: kontr deyip yaptýrsa mýydý?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He basically removed partner from the decision making with 3@D ... partner's never going to try 5@D after a weak raise like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: oh ,clubs are not breaking|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other boring NT? Can miss it if @S lead from S|pg||
nt|ahri:  a regular 3NT hand here|pg||
nt|pinticus: 10 top tricks here|pg||
nt|yusufb: 29 nolu bordda 6@d dersek baya iyi olur 800 telafi ettigimiz gibi bayada sayý alýrýz ama batan yere gelirsek kotü|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ca³e szczêæie, ¿e obroñcy te¿ bêd¹ mieli tu swoje k³opoty|pg||
nt|panosk: dont seem to have any problem this way either, i think they will now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||
nt|mamos: I think he should have started with @d   and then bid 6@c the next round|pg||
nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||
nt|famus: looks hopeless|pg||
nt|liujing: but not easy to stop with 25HCP|pg||
nt|famus: but for @s pips|pg||
nt|lechcold: dobra obrona w wykonani Francuzów|pg||
nt|lechcold: wykonaniu|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eugenio123: it's not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|key1809: north is not going to stop|pg||
nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|famus: restricted choices of lead produces the best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|frankbo: seems like he need one D trick to make|pg||
nt|famus: @d10 might produce the setting trick|pg||
nt|famus: from the bidding N wud soon work out Declarer's sing @D|pg||
nt|famus: as the play progresses and has to remain vigilant|pg||
nt|vasmar: stis 20 ta 78 imps einai 25-1|pg||
nt|kaapo: I haven't got or seen EW's notes on agreements so don't know for sure but quite likely|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can draw trumps, play a heart up and then set the diamonds (or diamonds first and heart then)|pg||
nt|gio 89: once again, same lead as in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: best lead lets declarer do his guesses -but i think it doent help defence |pg||
pc|cT|nt|yusufb: partskora kolay kolay X demez zeynep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he had bid 4@D the first time, then partner will move on when that is correct ... and partner can also move on with 4@S on a 4-card suit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  both have showed their hands :) no more to say|pg||
pc|c7|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: West has 6-6  has had three rounds of bidding and hasnt managed to show one of his six card suits yet|pg||
nt|chrisky: i told ypu we play better they bid better...:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because @H3-3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: if this goes wrong it will be entirely East's fault|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  wow, nice stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice @c fit makes 6 @h or @c laydown ,but opponents bid so much that it was not found |pg||
nt|yusufb: derseki bilki en az 2 içeri:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h e kontr derse @s e ceza pasý geçmiþtim anlamýnda oynuyoruz biz(erenin eli)|pg||
nt|famus: great move--v interesting plan|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 down here i think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on best defence, this is heading down 800, for a deserved Italian swing|pg||
nt|bebechira: -3?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: As weel as @H from same side.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I must say that  I am impressed with the danes in closed room to day |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 7-k¹!!! czemu tak brutalnie?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think we will pass now|pg||
nt|cicus: I was told the same by a very reliable kibitzer :)|pg||
nt|ritong: two very reliable kibs  both orange stars|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eugenio123: n is looking for 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: running scores http://tiniyurl.com/6jn39hs for juniors|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, how will he figure out the spade K, |pg||
nt|key1809: maybe a 5nt ,now|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he knows nothing about K@H so it is difficult to place all his @h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d, 2;h,and a @c|pg||
pc|dA|nt|goss: hi all|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Adrien|pg||
nt|panosk: ruff a club and home|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, 7 shd be ruled out, even with the Sp K, cant count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: and http://tinyurl.com/6leq5ej for girls|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eugenio123: and now what to lead?|pg||
nt|key1809: Trump?|pg||
nt|key1809: looks safe|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume, he will go for a trump lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's hard, he would preserve his 10 @s |pg||
nt|yusufb: 6@d demiþiz |pg||
pc|h5|nt|key1809: West is on lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ahhhhhhh ok lol|pg||
nt|eugenio123: so trump seemed so normal, @d is another way to lead|pg||
nt|key1809: that was not a good opton, |pg||
nt|rodal f: Karlson by a pzyke?|pg||
nt|timve:  only 7 trikcs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42:  must be careful playing this|pg||
nt|timve:  would bid 1NT with south his hand|pg||
nt|lady007: so would I|pg||
nt|timve:  2@C on Q10xx |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: Claim|pg||
nt|lady007: might wrongside NT contracts but you dont even know if you have a club fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: should make if no high ruff comes to his maind|pg||
pc|c9|nt|goss: this one doesn't look good for my friends...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: and i am not talking about BBO star|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eugenio123: small @C ruff?|pg||
nt|key1809: ruff a club, and finesse spades, for 13, shdnt be that difficcult:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I would like to know what he's thinkig about lol|pg||
nt|famus: Ah i thot @D paly wud've been a great coup|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  austria made 6NT here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahri:  two tables made 6@c, one went down|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|timve:  yep|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahri:  my best guess is that east underbid because of known @s shortness in partner's hand|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  last board until the break |pg||
nt|cicus: 8 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: gabor, behave!|pg||
nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||
nt|yusufb: ilkdevrenin son eli|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt oynanýr|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin iyi atak yaptý ben yapmazdým @c A atagý|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he made it|pg||
nt|friggi: Sweden made some blunders missing the slam though|pg||
nt|kaapo: Oh, better news for Sweden then|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not clear to reach 4@S on that one but if South gets to hear about 3-card support he should give it a try|pg||
nt|bagman: by cashing the @DA, E prevented the nice safetyplay of @DQ (taking care of AT9x on W)|pg||
nt|zebutin: Vallivaara has quite good distribution... 6@D isnt exactly hopeless, just doesn't make|pg||
nt|goss: with a quite hard end (4 top countries to play) France aims at winning its qualification for the world championship|pg||
nt|goss: but a third place would anyway be appreciated :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: they will qualify...|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I must say that N/S Is very unlucky. |pg||
nt|stevedr: i would just call it bad def in other room|pg||
nt|veistikke:  their other partners have costed them 30 imps |pg||
nt|andreasw:  Danish match had a fun board:) who was more lucky? the ones who went 2 down in 6@d wich has 12 tricks and only lost 3 imps? or the ones who bid 7 wich was down 1 while 6 stands and gained 3 imps:)?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w po³owie rozdañ pad³y remisy|pg||

nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||

nt|bebechira: even without Thomas Bessis...they have very good players..Thomas was the special one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Advice for South?|pg||
nt|gio 89: EW went a little too far in OR, 4@s -1|pg||
nt|gio 89: same goes for EW here|pg||
nt|runnerup: they all bid 4 @s so no + score here either|pg||
mb|p|nt|yusufb: 30 imp geriyiz fakat yetiþebiliriz |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||

nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||

nt|bagman: might kill W hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||

nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@C from rubino?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be pass and 3@C from Kytömaa|pg||
nt|kaapo: you think? :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@d was made?|pg||
nt|bagman: lead director with Axx|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, i have seen some weird stuff before...this wouldn't be even top 5...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even though 6@D is laydown, I think this was the correct auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just shows the value of the preempt|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was just typing ..what happened to 6d|pg||
nt|goss: yes 6@d is making but hard to reach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The way to get to 6@D is for South to re-open with 5@D, and North to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|lechcold: problem w tym, ¿e WJ nie przewiduje ¿adnego rebidu z t¹ kart¹:)|pg||
nt|panosk: small spade beter here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I honestly think that 3NT was the better percentage choice|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But this is what we need :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Double would be nice though ;)|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart lead and ducked|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba wola³bym 2@C, wskazuj¹c 5+trefli i 15+PC|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I guess some of them wont sleep that good tonight :P|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: except that this makes now -lead was enougt  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
nt|andreasw:  naaah:) after playing alot of bridge you will allways sleep good:)(unless you went down in 7nt with 18 top tricks!);)|pg||
nt|panosk: lead or 3rd seat ur choice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I did once ;)|pg||
nt|runnerup: seems to go down even after this help -but lets see|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
nt|famus: bingo--trump lead best for defence|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: mistery:)|pg||

nt|zebutin: N/S have some cards again|pg||
nt|bagman: NS slam in hearts (or probably in clubs and NT too)|pg||
nt|bagman: NT and clubs from N|pg||
nt|bagman: hard to bid, easy to make|pg||
nt|goss: i agree with you|pg||
nt|goss: in pairs it would be obvious; in teams, we could also double and on clubs bidded by pd, bid diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mamos: not much for anyone here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i have to leave guys, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@s is 5@s and 4+minor, weak|pg||
mb|2H|nt|timve:  3@C with south or pass?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chrisky: 1 nt for ns|pg||
nt|ntmon: or 6@D for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they super raise with balanced hands|pg||
nt|lady007: 3@c is pass/correct|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table east just played it out after @h j -and @h ---two way to make -with @s finess -or @d to ace -no he played small -when north switched a @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i hope it s not 2NT " almost forcing"|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eugenio123: in the same time Italy, my team, is winning 42/18  |pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@c is min|pg||
nt|goss: but then you need to have discussed the auction with pd : 3S p p X p 5C p 5D|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew --some 9-10 in @d but i bet they dont play there -or-lets see|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||
nt|ahri:  operator: did north upgrade or is it 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 3 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: though|pg||
nt|famus: 4-1 trump break again we see|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Specs. S can not bid 3@H now. Game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he upgrated to 15|pg||
nt|chrisky: or 2@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: but agree, @S fit is at hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I must say I like to play 2NT NF|pg||
nt|zlatan: typical 1nt opening after a bad board :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they managed to bid 4@S at other table too on 15, so most likely same score|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H to prawdopodobnie dwukolorówka:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|goss: here Robert is showing 5-5 with little hope for slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pinticus: Italy gains 3MPs,Madala plays 6@s+1 on 14(@d lead)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT promising 4-card support I hope :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and inv+|pg||
nt|runnerup: this 4 @s makes what ever he trys --4 @s --really -pass -ok|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
nt|goss: otherwise, he wd bid 4@d|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@D directly over 1NT?|pg||
nt|goss: yes french standard|pg||
nt|goss: showing 5-5 majors, game level|pg||
nt|8252: non parla l'italiano qui ? |pg||
nt|goss: si si :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think this convention is the most common in sweden after 4 NT blackwood|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
nt|bagman: if 2@S was FG, S had time to listen to a reaction from N with 3@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The youngsters are required to play French Standard, are they?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|famus: wud go down in 5@s ass well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahri:  good switch|pg||
nt|eleni: yet pls gfollow the final scores on the sute of the Youth's European Champioship:) as they chanfe ar every board:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: a bit too shy E here|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but can he set up the spades then?|pg||
nt|juan lukas: on a @d lead, declarer has to pick up the Q@s |pg||

nt|chrisky: tha mporw..|pg||
pc|s8|nt|timve:  if he went for it yes|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe it would have worked better for east to return a low heart, so west can play another round of trumps|pg||
nt|timve:  yep|pg||
nt|ybob: S showed AQ @D now|pg||
nt|famus: i think instead of 4nt e wud've done well had he cue bid in @Cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H probably shows some extras as with a weaker hand South might jump to 4@H over 2@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I don;t like 4@C becasue it's hard to get back to 3NT|pg||
nt|goss: no they aren't but i quite know those ones|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: Just look at the site, after the end of each round |pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think that West's duck of @DA was all that wise|pg||
nt|runnerup: brave double but they do it rigth time -ns very high with those values|pg||

nt|ahri:  cash&carry for croats now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Give the children a shower. I will brb|pg||

nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, trasnfers open's up a whole new range of possibilities|pg||
nt|eleni: a flat board that should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have one good board each from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is good for Denmark, 20 will be good for Sweden|pg||
nt|lady007: this hand looks more interesting|pg||
nt|timve:  wild board again|pg||
nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
nt|dkkello: On running score board 14 is wrong |pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are in the mini 1NT zone|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahri:  (although he was belgian)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and Hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes it does... almost too many options|pg||

nt|dkkello: and that defense didnt look right either|pg||
nt|friggi: 6NT here or what?|pg||
nt|bebechira: rememeber brd 15 ... the -800?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: So East will have to open 1@H and try to tell the extras later|pg||
nt|bagman: W has an easy decision to preempt; more difficult if 3@H or 4@H|pg||

nt|mamos: this will be a 4 imp gain for Greece|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly a good tool  needs a decade to get operational, perhaps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's extraordinary what a huge impact such a small change has with transfer responses|pg||
nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||

nt|8252: surprising french standard commands a 1@s|pg||
nt|goss: I don't understand here|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||

nt|kaapo: But at least bidding slams is nice. Keeps the players fresh :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: thx Todor|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes or 6 :P depens how they lead|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @d everytime they get inn|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
nt|bagman: N needs to push the @SQ thru|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt /4 @h -those will do -but 800 you cant get so 9 lost here ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS in trouble in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: why?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E opens 2@d multi|pg||

nt|goss: 5@c showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Asks for trump queen|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will play @D AK and @D and play for a @S houner in place|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is hard ...and Delle Cave 4nt made things easy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  i dont belive on that result after a splead in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@D is down on a @S lead????|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently Fryklund didn't believe his partner has any trumps, but he had a trump trick himself|pg||
nt|bagman: now the @HQ scores and NS can take the club ruff, too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem with the double ... partner bids 4@C, and there goes 3NT which could easily be your only making game|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||
nt|goss: then hope to also make 5@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
nt|8252: double ruff brings 12 easy tricks, if W doesn't switch @s : 9 @s K @d and the 2 aces|pg||
nt|rado: that's the reason people open 3@S sometimes:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chrisky: no quess is neded|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: 1ha shows nt hand or hearts and clubs, 1sp asks, 1 nt shows balanced hand - same spec|pg||
nt|baardolav: a good game 5@d, a little bit unlucky|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for your kind help, all pectators|pg||
nt|cicus: good contract reached|pg||
nt|dkkello: I know!   read my E-mail adress!|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding here|pg||
nt|galois85: so let's get back to 15-15? |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So they one good slambidding and one bad  |pg||
nt|friggi: this will bring some IMP's to Sweden:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here the bidding was natural |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|eleni: and that was not the card it should have feen plaued:)|pg||
nt|timve:  south tries to find an 6 sixth trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|key1809: wouldnt he open 1nt with 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|eleni: now things look a lot brighter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19-11 VPs is my guess|pg||
nt|goss: here once you have made the 3 and 4 of spade, you're home|pg||
nt|bebechira: Italy is extending the lead , but unfortunately for them..Israel is only 11 imps down to Netherlands at the moment|pg||
nt|8252: correct, but on @s switch, Robert must play on his @c, with precise timing|pg||
nt|goss: all that results are not helping my country !|pg||
nt|goss: yes, @s switch would have jeopardize the contrat|pg||
nt|lechcold: teraz bêdzie -2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: A new @H are normaly the best def. Don't matter here.|pg||
nt|eleni: now it's imperative the 9|pg||

nt|famus: last chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: Nice def|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lady007: he'd better give his partner a club ruff or there wont even be a 5th trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark now a firm 3rd 17 vps ahead of France|pg||
nt|veistikke:  avoid would be nice :P. |pg||
nt|bambik: masz racje Lechu|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eugenio123: with 5 cardss majors?|pg||
nt|8252: forced to play well now, like we say in the Lions Club of Derbyshire|pg||
nt|8252: it's funny to see how double ruff play is not natural : this board should take 30 seconds |pg||
nt|goss: he might be tired...|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 3 szóstki?|pg||
nt|bambik: za chwile okaze sie czy ma 00|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andreasw:  @S 10 would be wrong.. i highly doubt W would play a @S back if he had an honour if he had and felt endplayed it would 100% be the K;)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chrisky: quess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: for those more interested in the meaning of bids: 2@C Stayman, 2@S 4@S, 3@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|cicus: but S did not obey|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|lechcold: dobra obrona|pg||
nt|bambik: szczesliwie nie musi|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|nt|cicus: for me the concept of inquiring the balanced hand is hard to grasp|pg||
nt|panosk: my personal opinion and with no disrespect for the rest of the teams here , Israel was the favourite from the start|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like opening with 5 cards majors|pg||

nt|juan lukas: but if S open weak @d , they will play 5@d i think |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north may bid spades first|pg||
nt|ybob: but lost 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: they take a break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lose 4 trump tricks in 5 diamonds it seems|pg||

nt|bebechira: Israel-Netherlands 35-36 so 15-15|pg||
nt|goss: should reach 4@h here|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie ma emotek :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: another monster hand|pg||

nt|goss: which is touchy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ntmon: NS shall cope with this preemt|pg||

nt|lady007: 2@d multi|pg||

nt|lady007: lets see if they will compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 3NT by N ? |pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|goss: but could make on @s good guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i was at danish festival ... was playing a tourney .. i was in 2nt where all just sat bad and i was glad i was in 2nt! i somehow got 8 tricks and i had like 5:D no one else took 8! except my pd who was playing with someone else who where in 3nt |pg||
nt|panosk: that was the general feel indeed |pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d here is well done -i wander if it is bid without ns ,s help -needs @h 3-3-so |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  most probably 3NT hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and took 9 lol:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: they must steer away from the rather poor slam|pg||
nt|ritong: just needs a @d jack to produce a cold slam|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|cicus: if the bid slam with @DJ and stay in 5@D without it we say well done|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if 2@s describes this handtype, the @s K is not wasted|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 4 @s but bad sits -down 1 is the destany|pg||
nt|kaapo: Though a kib would have played small diamond, hoping for a misguess by the chocked declarer :)|pg||

nt|lady007: cant really bid 5@h with that|pg||

nt|ritong: well done|pg||

nt|eleni: Kacper is informing me now that Miss Sakowska in S at the open table is a girl:):) we wish her all the luck:)|pg||
nt|lady007: but we've seen them bid very agressive before|pg||
nt|lady007: no, not this time|pg||

nt|lechcold: tego ju¿ W nie zniesie:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|pinticus: oh,he discarted the wrong card,so 1iMPs for turkey|pg||
nt|friggi: sry -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||
nt|ahri:  4 minors to cash and then it's time to let mr. Coudert guess spades|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H -1 6@D =|pg||
nt|eleni: E-W as they are behind they are playing a catenaccio:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like Finland might be getting chunk of imps back, when Italy is playing at 4@S in deal 16|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to s¹ skutki wejæ po kilkakroæ podlimitowych|pg||
pc|sA|nt|key1809: he had 8 tricks in the bag, trying for overtrciks, and rightly paying the price|pg||
nt|rodal f: Switch a @C    @S NS and EW have a nice major|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least on the diamond lead|pg||
nt|goss: only @c really beats it|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but surely NS have underbid, after all 5 diamonds a good contract|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: and declarer may take the @c correctly |pg||
nt|goss: :( :(|pg||
nt|goss: well done by Di Franco|pg||
nt|8252: is Difranco related to Massiliano Di Franco ?|pg||

nt|goss: who are you refering to ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|friggi: need also friendly lead:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|bagman: now declarer probably guesses the spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
nt|bagman: and ducks twice to set up a spade for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|veistikke:  dbl from west shows 15+|pg||
pc|s2|nt|goss: few mistakes by Italians since I arrived|pg||

nt|Walddk4: And now the good board for Sweden. Rimstedt did well when she passed 1@H. It propelled N-S to 4@S, and 5@D can't quite make. And even better, the Swedes collected 500 when declarer ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of an exciting match|pg||
nt|lady007: south might double, but north wont and might even bid 5@s|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
nt|ybob: as 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west should have bid 4 spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: and of course many thanks to Bill, Adrien and Rado..excellent job as well|pg||
nt|lechcold: wyniki live|pg||
nt|lechcold: no niestety...|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie nasza para otwiera bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|veistikke:  how they only got :P|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like this may turn out for a decent match for our team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure I care for that 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: ka¿de 11, itp|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table made it i am told|pg||
nt|famus: this has been an eventful contest--both teams played well--But i give my vote to the Danes as winner in todays contest--they displayed great resilience--well done--Thanks alll|pg||
nt|liujing: last board|pg||
nt|liujing: a lot of swings in this segment|pg||
nt|spenny80: buffon|pg||
nt|spenny80: sorry it was my pw|pg||
nt|garden2005: na pochy³e drzewo ka¿da koza skacze :)|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
nt|bagman: this might make for a small gain compared to 1NT down one|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I see now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: tx all operator kibs and commentators:)|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
nt|lechcold: st¹d brak inwitu 2BA od Tuczyñskiego|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
nt|runnerup: guessing now to all -2@c -good hand --2@d=8+ --3@d= gf with @h and @d and so on|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
nt|kaapo: France up against Israel, so with a great result, Italy would've been much closer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Grzesiu pamiêtasz mo¿e detektywa Banaczka?|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: by³ taki serial i tam wystêpowa³ Banaczek - Polak z pochodzenia choæ Amerykanin|pg||
nt|bambik: nie rozumiem dlaczego pierwszego trefla zabil krolem przeciez potrzebuje dojsc do reki|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i on cytowa³ polskie przys³owia w swoisty sposób je krzy¿uj¹c np. kto rano wstaje to ka¿da kmoza skacze|pg||
nt|lechcold: w tej chwili 6 miejsce od 10 dzieli tylko 7VP...5 kandatów na jedno premiowane miejsce|pg||
nt|lechcold: nasi maj¹ 2VP do 6-go|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i tak cz³owiek skazany na ogl¹danie gromadzi te niedok³adnoci a potem mówi¹, ¿e zmierz³y i czepia siê do byle czego|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na szczêcie kontrakt jest dalej chodliwy na podziale pików|pg||
nt|panosk: then he shud jus bang the Ace@H and pray|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 2 @c like gazilli -can be normal hand also with @h and @c -but then he would bid 2 @H to 2 @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
nt|goss: 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|liujing: thx all|pg||
nt|famus: I was going to respond--since I praised the Danish boys more--maybe the Italian in you got aroused and called me a buffoon--haha:))))np Fabio|pg||
nt|liujing: 4@S is played in open room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: N ma niezbyt komfortow¹ sytuacjê jest w czym w rodzaju ucisku Mortona |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ntmon: 3NT is normal but destined to fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: next match of Italy is the decisive one...they face Israel and ONLY a big win will give them any chances to the title|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ussaly when you dont get many tricks in a contract there is can be 2 reasons  1. Bad declaring 2. good defence;)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chrisky: claim|pg||
nt|chrisky: =|pg||
nt|mamos: bad news for Greece from OR |pg||
nt|mamos: as 3@sx=|pg||
nt|veistikke:  ;)|pg||
nt|panosk: this is the last board of this match and day for juniors|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2off|pg||
nt|lady007: he knows partner will only have 4 (4th best leads) so the 9 is only wrong if partner led from AQ8x|pg||
nt|timve:  yep |pg||
nt|timve:  think if north plays a heart |pg||
nt|timve:  west will cash his trikcs|pg||
nt|timve:  for 9|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
nt|frankbo: down now i thk|pg||

nt|panosk: we must thank our very able operator Todor, well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: 1@D-1NT is an  easy pass for me|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: the match has seemed quite close but too many silly mistakes from Greek team |pg||
nt|chrisky: specialy in the other room|pg||
nt|eleni: The kids are stressed, from all sides we suppose|pg||
nt|baardolav: with 16 too?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT then|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|mamos: how old are this pair?|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can cash the @SA and play on sidesuits for a make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|timve:  now a free finesse|pg||
nt|dkkello: very close around 3 position now , this will be 17-13 or so for denmark |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|veistikke:  should have returned @s back :P|pg||
pc|h2|nt|zlatan: its good they finished 50 minutes earlier than given time, they have time to rest to take maximum Vs  last placed Belgium |pg||
nt|runnerup: yes that was not a good idea in this board -to ruff heart |pg||
nt|frankbo: down 2 i thk|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|andreasw:  So last board of the match! Thx to fellow commentators specs players and vugraph cordinator! |pg||

nt|goss: bye all|pg||
