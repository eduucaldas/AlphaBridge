nt|liraren: anyone know anything about EW system please tell me|pg||
nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Frank Bogen and Liu Jing|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H looks normal here - unless NS end up in trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: only partials here -even thought -4 @s doens seem so bad |pg||
nt|famus: Hi Liu Frank|pg||

mb|3N|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
nt|liujing: this must be an important match|pg||
nt|liujing: 2nd(ITA) against 3rd(DEN)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably he will leadwith Q@h|pg||

nt|ybob: not necessary after this lead ...|pg||
nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||
nt|famus: the current standings are such that it can go to the wire in the final rounds:srael -275. Italy -261, Denmark -235, France -230. Norway -225, Croatia-221|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||
nt|eleni: Thx operator of this transmission:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D start will kill 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: doubled  :)|pg||
nt|liujing: while Israel leads Italy by 14VP|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead makes this quite hopeless|pg||
nt|kaapo: I hope it wasn't the Italian waitress who caused the outage - or if it was that at least she brought some good food :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree but still good save|pg||
nt|vasmar: hello|pg||
nt|chrisky: no 5 i think bill|pg||

nt|kaapo: Quite a many tricks in a club contract so there weren't a great trouble for the Swedes|pg||
nt|galois85: good afternoon everybody|pg||
nt|zebutin: on 1st deal they managed to climb only to 3@S, but made one trick less, so score is still even|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|possessed: open room East open this|pg||

nt|vasmar: so phantom sacrifice|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N is quite a bid. can be a disaster if partner doesnt bring anything|pg||
nt|arigun: tek sorun zeynep durabilecekmi|pg||

nt|frankbo: yes makes easy now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lady007: i think i would have passed with north but i wouldnt be happy about it|pg||
nt|zebutin: and click on tbl number you want to know more about|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks rather a normal contract but maybe West could search for 5@D on the way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|possessed: 3sp probably means invitation with 4 card|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h5|nt|ntmon: good guess by declarer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lady007: maybe he could have tried to play another spade, in case partner has T9 of hearts|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||
nt|lady007: oh no, wont help, he bid 3N so declarer will never play him for the stiff king|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|gmarco24: after A@d situation is pretty clear for declarer|pg||
nt|lady007: at the other table east opened the bidding and then EW missed 4@h|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@D might be a better contract but far from laydown with a spade lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|juan lukas: push board |pg||

pc|d6|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  i agree with subhash, you don't bid 2@d with only 4@s and say 2@h; if LHO bids 3@D you have to guess, may miss a cold 4@s or bid a ridiculous final contract|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||

nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden seems to have given up strong club and shifted to this system instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes its the new swedish club ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||

pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||

nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||

nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||

nt|mamos: EW have the major fits to maybe cause problems here|pg||
nt|possessed: 5cl seems cold, but lets see if they can bid|pg||
nt|ntmon: hard to reach  |pg||
nt|tejjyid: "6 decent cards in a pleasant hand" is a good description (probably not acceptable in the ACBL)|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|offthebend: only 3 imps tho - deserve more than that |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  only 3 imps, but it should have been 5 for denmark|pg||
nt|timve:  hello all|pg||
nt|lady007: hi Tim|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Tim|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 2 was played in 4 spades making all 22 times|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with 16 HCP and stiff @s ,  would have doubled for sure so no finesse against J @s |pg||
nt|ybob: S showed A@S KJ @H A@D and K@C, with A@S stiff not bid pass over 3@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: wery good result for F in open here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  or some FG hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is 15+9 balanced hands worth game?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d by south I guess|pg||
nt|ahri:  (almost) misfit distributive hands, this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  East was squeezed on  3 - nice play by Giampetro on that one|pg||
nt|ritong: south has to invite|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural 2NT seems to match his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it'sa whole lot of losers, but too many points to do less|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great bid,the natural 2NT|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might end in 3NT here; down with a spade lead and make if declarer can get 9th trick from diamonds in time|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  it all depends on how do you agree what 3@h is here. some play it forcing, some play it constructive NF, I don't find any of those "wrong" :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c is GF relay|pg||
nt|lady007: wild board|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi 3nt sorunsuz oluyor diyecgim gen olmayacak|pg||
nt|arigun: ne dersin yusuf ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: an over-ambituous 3NT:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  west is quite aggressive and unpredictable. I know that best, he's my ex partner :)|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||
nt|dkkello: Denmark with a great oppertunity here|pg||
nt|ybob: clear slam |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  U have the same problem if u bid 1@h nat and opps bid 3@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: With 4-4 you can double using standard methods|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open|pg||
nt|bagman: 15-17 + 9 is always a game|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt forcing 2@d|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||
nt|eleni: a tricky lead of small !g can keep them off slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||
nt|eleni: !g|pg||
nt|eleni: THX Todor dear for the explanations:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but east should have taken @DA earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: after the @c lead, is a claimer|pg||
nt|lady007: seems like NS are back on natural bidding now, after the overcall |pg||
nt|timve:  3NT by south?|pg||
nt|lady007: Wouldnt 3@d show 5/5 now?|pg||
nt|timve:  I think so|pg||
nt|lady007: not sure i want to play 3N with the south hand then|pg||
nt|timve:  but in diamonds you know the wrong hand will play|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|mamos: everyone cuebidding :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||
nt|chrisky: it promisses fit in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
nt|yusufb: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@c forcing 2@d*|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@s=4@h|pg||
nt|kaapo: This looks like puppet stayman|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@c gazzilli 2@d 8+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 4@S looks normal here unless West falls too deeply in love with the void|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: promising 1st or 2nd round control in @hs|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@h means " all was natural"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt=min no 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
pc|c5|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer plays low and there's no good move for W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kaapo: When was the Häxan convention invented, Johan, do you know?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Was it before or after Gazzilli?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: EW  have done their job   hopefully their teammates can do theirs|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s lerden batýramayýz antrede yok ortakta puan ve @d var|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|eleni: French courtesy to pd:) Lorenzini is a young gentleman:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this makes 4 @s seems good idea from ew -but  they were never inn bidding|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi @h pasi emniyetli|pg||
nt|yusufb: merhaba tekrar|pg||

nt|yusufb: hoþbulduk tezcan:)|pg||
nt|tez: kozlara batýnýn kart atmasý zor|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer sets now a spade trick and hopes that the defense sets him a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: Then he would have 9 tricks without relying on clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasmar: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello: This wont take long , though Niclas Ege is a very carefull player ( slow) :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: yes and he would have bid his @c suit after 2NT ( probably by transfert ) |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No after  i think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: He's probably questioning very carefully about EW's lead methods|pg||
pc|cT|nt|possessed: a deserved 11 imp|pg||
nt|offthebend: S has done well not to bid his Club suit which may help declarer play the D's right |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|eugenio123: just @c swithc to fail 2@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: Häxan ("witch") is the Swedish cousin of Gazzilli|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think it was Catarina Midskog who invented that one in the swedish way|pg||
nt|kaapo: It shows either a strong hand or long major|pg||
nt|galois85: I don't know that convention, any reference online?|pg||
nt|kaapo: While Gazzilli shows either clubs or a strong hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No NS plays like that way but the ordinary way in sweden is to play it lika Gazilli|pg||

nt|cicus: hi Andy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|_fonzie__:  after trick 1, i can imagine many cases where it is interesting to switch to clubs and many cases where you should play your singleton @d|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  but it shouldn't be a guess|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  with singleton heart in dummy, north should be able to indicate whether he holds something in clubs (Q or K) or not by playing his smallest or largest card|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, I see|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bagman: If the clubs are good for 3 tricks at trick 2, they would be good for 3 tricks after setting up the spade|pg||
nt|zebutin: playing for 10 seems curious, when at 1st trick he basicly finesed 9 away from Kytömaa, or am I missing something?|pg||

nt|liraren: but east didnt trust him|pg||
nt|lady007: if declarer has KJx you probably have to give him a heart trick anyway and then you have to hope partner gets the lead before he has 9|pg||
nt|timve:  good board for the Dutch|pg||
nt|lady007: the queen also caters for Jx in dummy and is unlikely to cost a trick|pg||
nt|liujing: is 4@H too fast here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: You never know when playing against Finns :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: making games, of course|pg||

nt|lady007: at the other table North didnt bid 3@d and now has to decide over 3N if he still wants to mention them|pg||
nt|lady007: think it was better to bid 3@d immediatly and get it off your chest, so you dont have to guess later|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: anybody bidding @H by W?|pg||

nt|arigun: ama sasar yanilir key card sorarsa ortagindan 5@s i gecen bir cevap geliyor|pg||
nt|kaapo: Riccardo's 1NT looks a little odd having opened light|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have a good partscore but not game with at least 3 aces and a spade to lose (or 3 clubs + 2 aces in NT)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||
nt|lady007: and west seems to think they are in a forcing situation?|pg||
nt|lady007: or maybe he thinks he hasnt showed his hand yet :)|pg||
nt|tez: yaptýrabilirler|pg||
nt|yusufb: K cekerse yapar|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: and easier 4@ss|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S and 1@C for sure losers|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  N should duck @CA once|pg||
nt|timve:  1NT with this hand is pretty agressive|pg||
nt|timve:  would you have bid it Marion?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested passing 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south choses the best 3 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  so, standard multi sequence here, some balancing, some moysians.|pg||
nt|ahri:  this table delivers interesting contracts.|pg||
nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe he wants to make it harder for EW to balance|pg||
nt|zebutin: which would seem reasonable with (sub)minimum opening|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42:  so perhaps @DQ @H ruff, @CK ducked, @H ruff|pg||
nt|offthebend: fast play 11 tricks - no swing |pg||
nt|lady007: yes. i might have bid it as well, not wanting to miss a possible 4@h contract|pg||
nt|gmarco24: A@d, @h to A@h, @d to K or...?|pg||
nt|runnerup: so handling as i sayed |pg||
nt|tez: 5@h diyecek..6 ya gelecekler|pg||
nt|famus: a good4@S|pg||
nt|liujing: I guess dbl shows 4+@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: kestirmeden oldu|pg||
nt|famus: yes but was a v hefty Neg X|pg||
nt|famus: W wouldn't have expected such a great dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make|pg||
nt|galois85: double dummy this can be make|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like comfortable make, so some more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The cards are nicely with @H 3-3, @S 3-2 and both rounded suit aces onside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  both current and previous croatian NPCs are kibitzing this table. this cannot be coincidence, they know where swings will be made.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but then unfortunately @DK does not cash|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but a tough contract..|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chrisky: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|arigun: ilk baord'dan anladigimiz kadariyla KG midi Nt oynuyorlar 12-14 civari birsey|pg||

pc|c5|nt|arigun: dolayisiyla bu sekanlari muhtemelen 12-14 dengesiz bir el vaadediyor 1@d-1@s-2@s yani|pg||
nt|kaapo: A couple of @C ruffs should do it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  see if the bidding helps him to do that|pg||
nt|galois85: sice spades are 3-3 one can just lose I spade, 3 diamonds and the club... |pg||
nt|friggi: decl must asume that @C are 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah well, maybe it needs getting the clubs right to avoid promotions|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer just needs to capitalize his good luck|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: gee, excommunication is a bit tough; a simple flogging should be adequate|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C-1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vasmar: -50 instead -140|pg||
nt|gmarco24: make it simple|pg||
nt|frankbo: will see D 5-1 so thk i will manage|pg||

nt|ntmon: +130 available|pg||
nt|bagman: now a heart up and soon the next board|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|cicus: so you can combine fitjumps with splinters by using cue as splinter and jump shifts as fit jumps|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|tez: Macarlarýn durumu ne?|pg||
nt|galois85: 6,5@s or 6,5@d in this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 4H should be bid and made -- 4S looks too expensive |pg||
mb|1C|nt|eugenio123: finally a game |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice NT contract|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S EW this time|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H=|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ?|pg||
nt|lady007: true juniors playing here, 6 boards and 3 doubled contracts so far|pg||
nt|juan lukas: fine result for france in open room |pg||
nt|arigun: orta þeker|pg||
nt|arigun: bizim 2 katimizdan 2 fazla su anda :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fryklund got the trumps wrong in the open room on the previous one and thus went down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chrisky: a @S contract for ew|pg||
nt|tez: 6. imiþler 11 takýmda|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42:  is similar to the prev. hand by her (probably) sister|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h doesnt look like a very good contract|pg||
nt|offthebend: North does not really have any convenient bid over the T/O dbl -- so pass will be ok but stretched to a RDBL  |pg||
nt|liraren: when i bid TO with west hand my pd always bid 3@c |pg||
nt|lady007: this looks like 4@s by NS|pg||
nt|lady007: coffee break|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: both @h/@s|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT don't make on @D lead|pg||

mb|d|nt|key1809: yes, evrything makes|pg||
nt|ybob: probably push hand|pg||
nt|ybob: sry can lost if 3 round @H|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt should have been -1 -5 @c can be made with qoublefiness in @h -this was a big bid -good or bad -i dont know|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS may be able to jam the bidding a bit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks normal to reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe West can suggest 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks also normal to go down in 4@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: @Ds are foul so no direct 9 tricks at NT either|pg||
nt|zebutin: knows partner had short spades, so @S K seems like wasted value on this auction|pg||
nt|zebutin: had = has|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: except 3nt:)|pg||
nt|cicus: should E go aggressive?|pg||
nt|ritong: he does|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  with diamonds behaving, sky is the limit here|pg||
nt|ritong: brutal, i d say|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, developing can sometimes be toxic|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead is favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult decision|pg||
nt|cicus: on a spade, we would go down quickly|pg||
nt|liraren: south must have  thougt that pass was forcing |pg||
nt|tez: biz 9. deðil mi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: ahaha|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = strong hand supp 3° ...|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Again, 1@D is shoing 4+@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes , Dennis BIlde shifted to a @C in open room in trick 2 , made it "easy" , but 3x @H |pg||
nt|yusufb: iyi atak yaptý|pg||
nt|zebutin: this was maybe little unexpected development|pg||
nt|kaapo: This may not be a good way to do it, either|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
pc|d3|nt|eleni: right, but a @c has to be given early to opps|pg||
nt|pinticus: seem 2@s=|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||

nt|frankbo: hard to take down this one|pg||
nt|drserhan: 10 takým var|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|ybob: no if it, declares play AK @S and run @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: and win too|pg||
nt|frankbo: great score for sweden|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||
nt|ahri:  12 tricks outside clubs (doubledummy)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its ok for 10 though..|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if 3 rounds in @h , declarer trump , play AK @s then @d no ? |pg||
nt|ybob: no way to defeat|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||
nt|key1809: but all roads lead to Rome|pg||

nt|vasmar: only if W overcalls in @D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Wd bye E here|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table Madala passed as South over the double, and West's 1@D didn't show any values|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here west was able to show something by doubling 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Danish declarer went 2 down in 6@D|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dkkello: true 10 tricks|pg||

nt|tejjyid: but typically my partnerships open 1@S very heavy|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky 4@S for N-S|pg||
nt|offthebend: after the RDBL , the player always owes a bid to his partner |pg||
nt|timve:  yep he still is|pg||
nt|timve:  in fact he is only 24|pg||
nt|timve:  but will be 25 later this year|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Bob, in OR Bob Drijver is playing right?|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i think that was the name, let me check  :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Marion, you know that... he played in Tijanjin 2006?|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: he played in my team|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh man, i am so old  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: :)|pg||
nt|tez: boþa umutlanmayýn:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4 te duramayabilirler|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 6h, a decent contract, needing 3-2 hearts, but not here with a bad break|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|gmarco24: i know, we beat in you in basketball, and (i really don't know how) tomorrow in bridge  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -the question here is can you stay out off this nonvuln game|pg||
nt|tez: her an 4@h yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt açardým ben batýnýn eliyle|pg||
nt|arigun: cok zor ... @s ler adam olmuyor|pg||
nt|tez: qx qx var majörlerde ataðý karþýlamak için|pg||
nt|arigun: defans yardim etse dahi 1@s artirir 9 lovede kalir|pg||
nt|kaapo: Denmark is currently 3rd, best of the Nordic countries|pg||
mb|1N|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
nt|yusufb: cok tehlikeli X bunlar|pg||
nt|kaapo: "antti è un nome maschile o femminile?" they ask in the open room. Without knowing any Italian my answer was "maschile"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
nt|yusufb: fazla anlaþmalarý yok olanlar bile buralarda fire verirken|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
nt|arigun: @DAK baslarsa defan durum sakat tabii|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edirse..ki edilir ..sonrasýný iyi ayarlamak lazým|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
nt|famus: first sign of  cheer for Danish fans with Italy going down in 4@S-- the declarer there lost trump control on a @H lead--he played !A and back-Danish yougster--took both @S and ...|pg||
nt|famus: forced a @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||
nt|liujing: and play @C AK|pg||
nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: EW play mini NT when vulnerable so West has max 9 HCP|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||
nt|tez: defans en zor yeri briçin..en zevklisi ayný zamanda|pg||
nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make this for a 5 IMP gain for Finland|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yusufb: sacma bi iþ yaptý|pg||
pc|s6|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
nt|kaapo: Especially after this switch|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
nt|friggi: not the best switch|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
nt|bagman: good time for espresso :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eleni: Basilis has to split honors in @d anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|tez: ortaðýnýn ne dönmesi gerektiðini söylemeli|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|nt|cicus: in effect, Gazzilli tries to translate the standard opening into a strong club|pg||
nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||
nt|tez: hala @c kaybý duruyor..batacak|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||

nt|tejjyid: There's a few problems with strong @C Gabor; Gazili sems like a nice compromise|pg||
nt|eleni: the @d9 was the key card:(|pg||
nt|vasmar: freak hand by North|pg||
nt|offthebend: hand for 6C |pg||
nt|offthebend: hope they at least get to some game |pg||

nt|liraren: i can´t imagine any bidding too 6@c so hope for game|pg||
nt|lady007: over 2@s, north will surely bid 2N and he might raise to 3 then|pg||

nt|friggi: Det kan godt være men vi skal snakke engelsk, skal vi ikke?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: 12+12 BAL is often a game|pg||

nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 3nt de|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt küçükler @c @h yani|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense needs to attack the spades in time to beat 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D even more|pg||
nt|cicus: unfriendly lie of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||
nt|timve:  but the spadelead seems normal, the clublead doesnt|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@c ye pas düsünülemez bile|pg||

nt|pinticus: X by E shows strong hand,3@d shows limit 5@h4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  two keycards missing here|pg||
nt|vasmar: double is dangerous|pg||
nt|offthebend: but does he gain anything out of it ?:)|pg||
nt|liraren: south X is transfer to @s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  tough call for north now, it's probably not clear that 3@c would be forcing|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  +50 was still worth 5 imps for Germany|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but may be caused a problem, this may head for 3N|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can access live scores by clicking on either JUNIORS or YOUNGSTERS|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nah, Italians usually have some fancy stuff, so this may only appear natural|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead is good start for defence|pg||

nt|tez: tam olacak 3@s ..@h dam ataðýýndan sonra|pg||

nt|pinticus: 5@h4@d*|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czego siê czepiacie jednej lewki...to tak jak ze stowy wydawaæ grosza reszty|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  good call, he knows @c king onside and just hopes for an entry in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: but he may need two entries if Kxx of Club is with W and S has to have at least 2 cards in Clubs |pg||
nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
nt|juan lukas: the 2@h opening helps EW to bid 5@d |pg||

nt|ybob: probably Gazzilli|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D alerted ?|pg||

nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
nt|famus: duck|pg||
nt|liujing: a good lead but a bad duck here|pg||
nt|famus: shud b careful not to release @hA|pg||
nt|galois85: yes 3@c asking major. What would you lead in N?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see 6 tricks; AQ of hearts onside does not help; he needs to set up the clubs and prevent EW from cashing 2 spades|pg||

nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: raise to game is moot action even expecting partner a king stronger|pg||

nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
nt|famus: so the Danes have managed to recover from the earlier shock|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||

mb|3D|nt|timve:  well would you have bid 5@D with south?|pg||
nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||
nt|timve:  I think you can make a case for double|pg||
nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
nt|liujing: sure, they catch up a lot|pg||
nt|friggi: Sweden is kicking back|pg||
nt|bagman: 11 more boards to come; unlikely that they would be 0-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table bidding was at 4@S before got to bid again after x with Di Francos cards...so they went to 5@D|pg||

nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||
nt|frankbo: new imps for sweden|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
nt|famus: The declarer mistimed his @D ruff in the last board--he shud ruff@D first and then return with @Hs--this can be a potential swing to Danes|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like nice pick up for finland|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Antti in the open room tried to prove he's a man by leaping to 4@S :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||

nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||

mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 Bal or strw @c,@h or @s|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D now or are there options?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||
nt|timve:  well if they lead a heart|pg||
nt|yusufb: slem oynicaklar|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *one|pg||
nt|offthebend: so 3 more imps to Denmark - in that case  |pg||
nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
nt|juan lukas: agressive 2@h and 4@h |pg||
nt|ybob: they are juniors :)|pg||
nt|tez: 12 puanla reverse yapýyor|pg||
nt|tez: çok ilerletmiþ|pg||
nt|yusufb: south stil olarak 2 konuþmasýnda 2@s diyo|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT on a @H lead!!|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@h is 4+@s|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H setting trump?|pg||
nt|bagman: this looks like a partscore in spades for 140|pg||
nt|kaapo: Aimala bid 4@S on this one too|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table bidding was 1@S-2@S-4@S on this, so they managed to get to fullgame|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so she could bid that to|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d baþlamasý dogru|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
nt|kaapo: How about 3NT? Denying a decent heart fit, or some kind of serious slam try?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is either trf w @h or trf to Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d baþlamasý gerekiyordu bence|pg||
nt|tez: ben ayrýlmak zorundayým..hoþçakalýn|pg||
nt|yusufb: byeee tezcan|pg||
nt|famus: but shud land in a @s partial--ah-uh--some imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||
nt|ybob: agressive to bid not to punish !!|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a bit too high|pg||
nt|tez: önce majör deðil..güç varsa önce uzun|pg||
nt|galois85: now 4@d  6@h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla thoughts that she has shown some values here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps via RKC to 6@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose a spade, a club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the hearts on the @DK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding 1NT istead of 2@S looks good, though probably they'd stop at 3 even if he raised|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lady007: you never know.... if there is no tomorrow ;-)|pg||
nt|tez: heyecanlandým þimdi|pg||
nt|tez: koz ne bilen var mý?|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4nt ye 7@d patlat gitsin|pg||
nt|famus: 5 back to italy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
nt|bagman: If N makes a help suit try in hearts, S has a very bad hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c oynatma bizi cengiz|pg||
nt|tez: yoruldum oluyor mu diye bakmaktan:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S might be kick back|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if can show shortness in diamonds and invite that way, not much better then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
nt|kaapo: In that case 5@C shows 1 or 4 keys... but maybe they weren't on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: must be the case|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
nt|tez: daha az yorardý|pg||
nt|arigun: seneye bize bi ekmek varmi tezcan bak bildim, gerci 2 sn olmadi ama :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin diyemedide eren dedi |pg||
nt|yusufb: madem 7 dicektin de niye 6@c dersinki|pg||
nt|arigun: masada 6@c hesitasyon varsa masaya ozel kuvvet gelebilir|pg||
nt|arigun: yani 6@c-6@d derken|pg||
nt|tez: 2/3 saniye düþünemeyecek miyim der selin|pg||
nt|arigun: perde de hesitasyon 20+ saniye kabul ediliyor bildigim adariyla|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So both player here thinks that they showed sometthing extras but partner didnt understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: Also facing a short suit trial in diamonds, S hand is not good for raise|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
nt|tez: perdeli oynanýyor maçlar..dolayýsýyla direktörler çok prim vermiyor ona|pg||
nt|kaapo: Somewhat strange as 4@D really looks like the ace to North|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
nt|tez: @h un birini yere çaktýrmak yeterli bu elde|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp gelecek|pg||
nt|tez: 10|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s Q kuzeyde biliyo|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The problem here that 3@h doesnt show a superhand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little break now|pg||
nt|chrisky: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|offthebend: now it is makeable |pg||

pc|c9|nt|tez: @s partajýna oynarsa olur ..@s empas yaparsa olur..bi tek @c ekspasýna oynarsa batar|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding at the other table seems quite inconsistent with what we've seen from the pair before|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  so lucky for Sweden that @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  otherwise would be 14 out|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now only 1|pg||
nt|timve:  this is the second match these two pairs play|pg||
nt|timve:  Helmich Hop seem out|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|yusufb: hesitasyon:geç deklere vermek, beklemek, tereddüt etmek|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps North didn't realize the opening was from 3rd hand and took 2@S as a constructive raise|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|offthebend: throw West in with last D and get last two clubs after cashin S and Heart to the K |pg||
nt|timve:  do you have more info about that?|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe only for the moment|pg||
nt|lady007: no|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't see that west can x 4 hearts, and for all E knows west may be just spades..|pg||
nt|ybob: X  KJXX  AJXXXX  AX, W X 4@H too shows good hand with @S not penalty|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think north could may be have doubled 4 spades|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Gerben42:  after being demolished by the two huge favorites, Eggeling - Brinck have a strong performance here|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||

nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||

nt|timve:  1@H with north|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3@d makes without @c ruff -but can you bid|pg||

nt|ahri:  he decided to keep them away of 4@s instead of pushing them into it. on this board, that was "wrong", on some other it will be "right".|pg||
nt|ahri:  all in all, 5 imps for croats|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  Here 1D always unbal|pg||
nt|kaapo: With a weak hand 2@S is available|pg||

nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||

nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|famus: restricted choices of lead produces the best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|frankbo: seems like he need one D trick to make|pg||
nt|famus: @d10 might produce the setting trick|pg||
nt|famus: from the bidding N wud soon work out Declarer's sing @D|pg||
nt|famus: as the play progresses and has to remain vigilant|pg||
nt|vasmar: stis 20 ta 78 imps einai 25-1|pg||
nt|kaapo: I haven't got or seen EW's notes on agreements so don't know for sure but quite likely|pg||

pc|sA|nt|yusufb: partskora kolay kolay X demez zeynep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||

nt|kaapo: you think? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@d was made?|pg||
nt|bagman: lead director with Axx|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, i have seen some weird stuff before...this wouldn't be even top 5...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But this is what we need :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Double would be nice though ;)|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart lead and ducked|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
nt|famus: bingo--trump lead best for defence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
nt|famus: there u go|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||

nt|lady007: 3@c is pass/correct|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: i hope it s not 2NT " almost forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: in the same time Italy, my team, is winning 42/18  |pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@c is min|pg||

nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Specs. S can not bid 3@H now. Game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he upgrated to 15|pg||

nt|ntmon: but agree, @S fit is at hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I must say I like to play 2NT NF|pg||
nt|zlatan: typical 1nt opening after a bad board :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they managed to bid 4@S at other table too on 15, so most likely same score|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pinticus: Italy gains 3MPs,Madala plays 6@s+1 on 14(@d lead)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT promising 4-card support I hope :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and inv+|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think this convention is the most common in sweden after 4 NT blackwood|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
nt|bagman: if 2@S was FG, S had time to listen to a reaction from N with 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||

nt|timve:  yep|pg||
nt|ybob: S showed AQ @D now|pg||
nt|famus: i think instead of 4nt e wud've done well had he cue bid in @Cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H probably shows some extras as with a weaker hand South might jump to 4@H over 2@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: I don;t like 4@C becasue it's hard to get back to 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: Just look at the site, after the end of each round |pg||

nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, trasnfers open's up a whole new range of possibilities|pg||
nt|eleni: a flat board that should be|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have one good board each from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is good for Denmark, 20 will be good for Sweden|pg||
nt|lady007: this hand looks more interesting|pg||
nt|timve:  wild board again|pg||
nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
nt|dkkello: On running score board 14 is wrong |pg||
nt|kaapo: EW are in the mini 1NT zone|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahri:  (although he was belgian)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and Hi|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes it does... almost too many options|pg||
nt|cicus: hi|pg||
nt|dkkello: and that defense didnt look right either|pg||
nt|friggi: 6NT here or what?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: So East will have to open 1@H and try to tell the extras later|pg||
nt|bagman: W has an easy decision to preempt; more difficult if 3@H or 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eugenio123: nice auction right now|pg||
nt|mamos: this will be a 4 imp gain for Greece|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly a good tool  needs a decade to get operational, perhaps|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's extraordinary what a huge impact such a small change has with transfer responses|pg||
nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|lady007: might end in 2@s here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|famus: sry -1--forgot they were in 5 only|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: and somewhat surprising it took so long to happen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Second time this set E-W in the open room bid a slam off two cashing tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was the other one|pg||
nt|lady007: will east rebid 2@c or 2@d? and do they play some type of gazilli here?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Are we to see a easy major or an NT end EW?|pg||
nt|baardolav: It open one extra bidding round |pg||
nt|lady007: and now what. he might well pass|pg||
nt|lady007: it might depend on the meaning of a direct 2@s response over 1@h|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like a board that should not affect any matches|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eugenio123: bad now :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@d is "weak weak two in major"|pg||
nt|kaapo: But at least bidding slams is nice. Keeps the players fresh :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
nt|bagman: N needs to push the @SQ thru|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS in trouble in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: why?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E opens 2@d multi|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah right, some East's might venture an opening|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
nt|famus: that wud set it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @d bye |pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D there so really a trouble|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Wasn't W free to bid 4@D at the road?. My way always.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  i dont belive on that result after a splead in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@D is down on a @S lead????|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently Fryklund didn't believe his partner has any trumps, but he had a trump trick himself|pg||
nt|bagman: now the @HQ scores and NS can take the club ruff, too|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||

nt|lady007: and then what|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|friggi: 4@H is good here due to a friendly layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|timve:  well I wont bid with east|pg||
nt|timve:  too many tricks|pg||
nt|timve:  wrong number of spades|pg||
nt|timve:  west has a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but west has an aceless hand|pg||
nt|lady007: cant really bid 5@h with that|pg||
nt|dkkello: I like Eges 3 @H , bravely done |pg||
nt|famus: since he hjad to find @Ds as he did for 3NT--a duck might have been brilliant|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: que by @S|pg||
nt|ahri:  this would be interesting in 3NT, to see how E would tackle minors|pg||
nt|ritong: well done|pg||
nt|cicus: please forgive my laziness not having  searched for their conventioncard|pg||
nt|eleni: Kacper is informing me now that Miss Sakowska in S at the open table is a girl:):) we wish her all the luck:)|pg||
nt|lady007: but we've seen them bid very agressive before|pg||
nt|lady007: no, not this time|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C probably 9-11 with 3-card @H support|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: this round has been a slaughter of imp|pg||
nt|ybob: nice dummy pd said E :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h bye Nin open |pg||
nt|kaapo: Also bid by both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: oh,he discarted the wrong card,so 1iMPs for turkey|pg||
nt|friggi: sry -1|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make only 8 tricks in hearts losing 4 blacks and a diamond|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||
nt|ahri:  4 minors to cash and then it's time to let mr. Coudert guess spades|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H -1 6@D =|pg||
nt|eleni: E-W as they are behind they are playing a catenaccio:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like Finland might be getting chunk of imps back, when Italy is playing at 4@S in deal 16|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|key1809: he had 8 tricks in the bag, trying for overtrciks, and rightly paying the price|pg||
nt|rodal f: Switch a @C    @S NS and EW have a nice major|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least on the diamond lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but surely NS have underbid, after all 5 diamonds a good contract|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: and declarer may take the @c correctly |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|friggi: need also friendly lead:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|bagman: now declarer probably guesses the spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
nt|bagman: and ducks twice to set up a spade for a diamond discard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ntmon: EW with combined 15 HCP X their opps in a partscore for penalty|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: *slam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: not bid in OR either|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bagman: did N think that E underlead the @SA ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahri:  playing @cK from doubleton didn't prove great for croats in their first match. here it was correct.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East a notorious ace-underleader perhaps...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|key1809: not a bad idea to go for overtricks, but ur contract shd never b in danger all the way|pg||
nt|kaapo: Madala managed to get his partner to declare|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Out for a push.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|timve:  think vulnerable you should only bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|dkkello: So far Tofte has done everything right today |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|timve:  when your pretty sure you make it vs an non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|timve:  bidding for 1 off |pg||
nt|timve:  isnt good imo|pg||
nt|lady007: well, they might not double you and then its a good save if they make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahri:  guessing time|pg||
nt|eleni: boy with all those conventions!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahri:  although i doubt he'll miss.|pg||
nt|kaapo: From East the leads were much friendlier|pg||
pc|d7|nt|friggi: sure|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chrisky: it was a asking bit for @C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lady007: but i agree, you should be very carefull bidding 5@h at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: well only 4 clubs left..|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|eleni: simple bridge=best bridge:)|pg||
nt|mamos: no great damage done here as 5@h-1 from OR but boy oh boy these Greek boys have had so  many chances here |pg||
nt|kaapo: Back in the 19 - 11 league, with Finland gaining 13|pg||
nt|bagman: If N has the @CA, he has the rest|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kaapo: Especially the dimond chosen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dkkello: around 18-12 19-11 for Denmark then |pg||
nt|bagman: so it's safe to play a club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 20 - 10 if looking at the right column|pg||

nt|eugenio123: thx all |pg||
nt|key1809: thx eugenio, |pg||
nt|ahri:  and some more 6carders |pg||
nt|ntmon: difficult to comment this one|pg||
nt|pinticus: really hard|pg||
nt|ntmon: let's go to final board, hope for more normal development|pg||
nt|ritong: last bullet now|pg||
nt|zlatan: anyway dbl is no almost no cost if in in other room partners dont bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And now the good board for Sweden. Rimstedt did well when she passed 1@H. It propelled N-S to 4@S, and 5@D can't quite make. And even better, the Swedes collected 500 when declarer ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of an exciting match|pg||
nt|lady007: south might double, but north wont and might even bid 5@s|pg||
nt|timve:  yep on this board its very good to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|lady007: even if its a wrong bid in theory, it might work out very well|pg||
nt|dkkello: well done |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: welldone|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Well played in both rooms|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yeah, on to the last board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: this rather offtrack opening might get them out of game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Todor, our excellent operator in Albena. Good job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: thx|pg||
nt|timve:  and preferably fast and convincing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor, our great operator!|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|eleni: Last board for this round:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we are back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden may even gain 12 IMPs here, but it won't change the result, 19-11|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d bye N|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eugenio123: I'll be back at 16:20 cet to comment italian girl... who knows what my eyes will see lol|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: the lower you stop in @S the better|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N for east here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Earlier I remarked that it has been a tough day for Finland - but tougher still it is for the operators, who may have to keep focused through all 60 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: next room could not avoid the 6@d snag|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Häxan in effect here?|pg||
nt|bagman: interesting 2@C|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mamos: so well done|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor for the fine work|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it seems they play forcing nt, another terrible convention I would never play|pg||
nt|ahri:  would be fun to see club lead with diamond underlead on 4@s. just for sake of entering bulletin.|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: :) ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sweating time for east|pg||
nt|ahri:  and a great lead for south|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think he is in control|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c showing any 16+ or 14-16 with 6@s|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@D showing 8+ and GF opposite 16+|pg||
nt|dkkello: 3 NT ?|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is good|pg||
nt|ybob: hard now  3nt :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S is a overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like 4 @s but can you make it -you have to be careful -@d ruff beats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He showed a cl suit here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C would be strong or long @Hs - so with clubs Mikael has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bagman: In NT the defense can grab 7 first tricks (and declarer has only 6 quick)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|key1809: i like to play it as SFG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 1½ hours with 4 more matches|pg||
nt|kaapo: Though maybe 1NT would be an option also|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Madala shows only @d in other room |pg||
nt|zebutin: seems finns are pushing for slam on 17...so might be again chunk of imps coming to Finlands bag|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
nt|ybob: as 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west should have bid 4 spades|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like this may turn out for a decent match for our team|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table made it i am told|pg||
nt|famus: this has been an eventful contest--both teams played well--But i give my vote to the Danes as winner in todays contest--they displayed great resilience--well done--Thanks alll|pg||
nt|liujing: last board|pg||
nt|liujing: a lot of swings in this segment|pg||
nt|spenny80: buffon|pg||
nt|spenny80: sorry it was my pw|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
nt|bagman: this might make for a small gain compared to 1NT down one|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
nt|kaapo: France up against Israel, so with a great result, Italy would've been much closer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
pc|c6|nt|liujing: thx all|pg||
nt|famus: I was going to respond--since I praised the Danish boys more--maybe the Italian in you got aroused and called me a buffoon--haha:))))np Fabio|pg||
nt|liujing: 4@S is played in open room|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: 3NT is normal but destined to fail|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chrisky: claim|pg||
nt|chrisky: =|pg||
nt|mamos: bad news for Greece from OR |pg||
nt|mamos: as 3@sx=|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2off|pg||
nt|lady007: he knows partner will only have 4 (4th best leads) so the 9 is only wrong if partner led from AQ8x|pg||
nt|timve:  yep |pg||
nt|timve:  think if north plays a heart |pg||
nt|timve:  west will cash his trikcs|pg||
nt|timve:  for 9|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
nt|frankbo: down now i thk|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ntmon: we have seen solid performance by both teams|pg||
nt|ntmon: but let's move to OR for final boards|pg||
nt|pinticus: thx all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: 1@D-1NT is an  easy pass for me|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mamos: the match has seemed quite close but too many silly mistakes from Greek team |pg||
nt|chrisky: specialy in the other room|pg||
nt|eleni: The kids are stressed, from all sides we suppose|pg||
nt|baardolav: with 16 too?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT then|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mamos: how old are this pair?|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can cash the @SA and play on sidesuits for a make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|timve:  now a free finesse|pg||
nt|dkkello: very close around 3 position now , this will be 17-13 or so for denmark |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|zlatan: its good they finished 50 minutes earlier than given time, they have time to rest to take maximum Vs  last placed Belgium |pg||
nt|runnerup: yes that was not a good idea in this board -to ruff heart |pg||
nt|frankbo: down 2 i thk|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahri:  another great board for croats.|pg||
