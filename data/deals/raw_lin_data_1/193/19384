nt|brolucius: An Icelandic kibitzer tells me proudly that they have 4 times provided Miss World.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, here it is brains before beauty.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hi folks, wc at this round 32 in the Spingold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Players briefly discussing system, about to start|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, World's strongest man.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Spoke last week with 'Svenni' an Icelandic TD in Albena at the youth EC|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do they have a world championship for TDs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now they're really starting!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 1nt is max on EW|pg||
nt|imp_jan: He is convinced Jon Baldursson is still the most competitive playe on his island|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jonsson will open a strong 1@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: were the four Miss Worlds bridge players?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C 17-up if balanced, on the E/W Precision system.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not much in it for ew in spite of thr 23 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, or 16+ unbalanced|pg||

mb|r|an|5-7|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: West will have used Pass and Redouble to describe his limited values.|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nowadays south will ovcercall 1@H, but v strong club a dbl (majors) is the popular approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT showed the majors, so North's 1@H did not guarantee any fit, really. 3@H was a bit much after that, but players like to make their mark on the 1st deal. To show they will not ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: be pushed around. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I wasn't here and am catching up - he did show 5-7, what bid was that and I'll back up and put it in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe South thought that North showed four hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: A double actually gives responder more bids. He can assign Pass, Redouble and 1@D  to have different meanings within the negative range.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W might have been more inconvenienced by 2@H, as it turns out.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true - but the redouble also gives advancer (responding defender) more options too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: That's what they claimed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: South again bids forwardly, staking a claim for the 'Macho Man' title. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East could bid 2@s here - he has done  |pg||
mb|3S|nt|imp_jan: 4@s interesting or 3n..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: classically, defines a weakish opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East's retreat in front of the redoubler proclaims a minimum distributional hand.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: E/W bid the hand well.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then that depends on what EW define as weakish|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so who has the @CJ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe East can set up two discards, with a bit of help.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: might not matter - on a heart lead, a diamond can be discarded |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only a @d lead and another @d to @dQ  can create problems|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Jonsson asks about signals: "standard"|pg||

nt|brolucius: It seems not, with North holding 3 trumps, so maybe ace and a low diamond to the queen was not required.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: North's hand is limited by him not bidding 2@H on the previous round.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|imp_jan: 2@S pretty agressive by west|pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Here we go. Now we are live.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hi All.|pg||
nt|joest: thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: hi|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bjr henri|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: this hand will test how low the Meckwellopeing bid requirement go|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting play of top @D from dummy   -   i wish i could think of that type of psychological play  before it is made at the table|pg||
nt|joest: over a 3@h opener Pettis might take action, I guess with double if you feel like you got out of bed on the right side|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler might just pass seeing if a   is available at these colors|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest: Gary is also a BIG fan of the 'blue card' or at least he was in his younger days|pg||
nt|joest: this is cold|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: looks like 2 lots of transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but removing to 5@c isn't that cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D = @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  So I would be cradle robbing :)|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H = @Ss|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: beth isn't timid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chorush: 500|pg||
nt|leo lasota: -500 is still much friendlier than 4h redbled making.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that lead worked out well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Boyd opened South hand 3@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d1 now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: if n/s play precision which is popular in tceland the 1nt will be 13-15|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chorush: Meckwell can take first 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- are you a 1@S or 1N bidder over 1@H?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
nt|kit: 6 top tricks, but hard to see where  7 will come from|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save after all :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
nt|kit: I always bypass 4-card spade suit -- can get it back if partner is strong, and makes bidding much easier when partner knows I'm unbalanced for the 1@S rebid.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||
nt|kit: normal style here -- count over attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: North does not know that South hasn't the @HQ.|pg||
nt|kit: obviously North can never find the play|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: always bypass when balanced, that is.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: you can keep an eye on the other table via  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for Meckstroth to find diamond shift|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|chorush: I don't believe in being crtical of opening leads in general but I really think a trump was called for here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: and it all went as predicted -- 12 IMPs to Robinson|pg||
nt|joest: i agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes careful defence|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 5@s????|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do I not like that 5@S!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pratap asked about 2@h before bidding 4@s and was told it was just a weak 2 bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow what a final pass by East..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: grammar, David, grammar|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Partner has pushed them to the five-level. That is not the time to hand the advantage back.|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are all playing the system: The five-level belongs to us!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: I have an old card for B-J where 2@h is described as "weak" - dates fom 2008|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe they are playing that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has no reason to place the @SK with West.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: tx Mike that explains a bit East's not doubling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pratap asks "you play second and fourth?" Jonsson: "on opening lead 2nd and 4th but later in the hand 3rd and 5th"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will soon wish that he had doubled. Indeed he probably did when the dummy went down.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he probably does already |pg||
nt|imp_jan: icemen heading for a nine imp gain on the brd still|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: It will still be a sizeable swing, which (some uncharitable people would say - not me) was just what North deserves.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pratap makes a sort of hmph'ing noise on the spade - now thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: Jan Martel, our VG operator, is one of the best at giving us table-side extra info. Much appreciated!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|joest: north south would seem destined for 3NT here|pg||
nt|kit: might not be so simple with East being 6-5|pg||
nt|kit: and West having 4-card diamond support|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: if the auction times out in such a fashion that Robinson gets to show his @Ds|pg||
nt|chorush: that;s true|pg||
nt|leo lasota: win king clubs, ruff heart, club to 9 ruff heart diamond up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low diamond lead was best dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I should know never to lead your suit."|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3/4@S now!?|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT = Jacoby|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: Probably responsive double by Rodwell here|pg||
nt|joest: Berk might have a problem if declarer plays low but Pettis might play Cohler for KQ98 I suppose|pg||
nt|joest: still if declarer has A10 he has two tricks coming|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: double must show a singleton @S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kit: Meck might bid 2@H -- not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice pressure by NS.  I don't see a way to make this|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: looks like a zugzwang position|pg||
nt|ritong: zugzwang is a chess term, meaning that you have to play and any choice is bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Palmer is certainly deliberate in her pace of play.|pg||
nt|ritong: say east leads a @h, three rounds of trumps, then good @d guess|pg||
nt|ritong: and east is cooked|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR rates roddy's hand as 17.40|pg||
nt|henryb:  North might lead a @d????????|pg||
nt|daman: strip the @Cs   draw trumps and play a @S?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: @D is the classic frozen suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I think it is cold now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: probably queen of diamonds played by Robinson at trick 1|pg||
nt|ritong: seeing that coming, palmer prefers to make it short|pg||
nt|othered1: with that lead, south may get endplayed when @S is lead.  Opening @S lead would have beaten it\|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup that looks right|pg||
nt|daman: Sontag is one of the fastest declarers in the world|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry about that.|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like most routes lead to down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    a cool tool to see how small changes can affect value of a hand|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Kit's line looks better than a club to the ace.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: a lot would depend on what west pitched on the spade jack too|pg||
nt|kit: maybe not -- East have had stiff king|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he was interested to find East with a single @CK.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Classic comment by S: "If I had bid @c would you have led a @s?"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd leads count card back, so Robinson knows Boyd has 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: tah day|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: will have to finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: which may lead to down 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd should be able to work out from this line of play that declarer has bid a 3-bagger.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s7|nt|kit: Declarer will simply take heart finesse and go down 1 -- noth much else left|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Still not clear how to defend -- he doesnt' know about club spots|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: This cover is not a good play I don't think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because West has a diamond entry|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson can still survive, but now it is trickier|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not at all easy to find, but this would have been d2 if berk had led heart through and cohler plays 3rd heart after cashing last spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: In fact, what happens if spector cashes a club now?|pg||
nt|joest: or one round ago?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to dump jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: yes, you're right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|joest: assuming becker could read to drop the @hk|pg||
nt|kit: or stiff his king of hearts if he is a real man|pg||
nt|roswolf: leading pard's suit is rarely wrong|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: snatching defeat from the jaws of victory|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: defense needs to get that ace of clubs out of there|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The North hand will make several tricks if he choose trumps, hardly any if the opponents do. That is a good reason to pre-empt and 3@H looks right with that suit.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@H inv for spade game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I had doubled 3@h as S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, this is what we paid our entry fee for|pg||
nt|brolucius: On similar bidding West signed off opposite partner's 3@H at the other table. (You can see the bidding by putting your cursor over the Closed Room result.)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Baldursson picks up Gordon's convention card to look at something, I don't know what. Now put it back and leaning back thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: That was conservative on his hand, after a protective 2@S bid. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps the weak 2  opening can mislead W with the count and play S with a doubleton @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet he's thinking, where's the kig of diamonds? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Baldursson asks what Pratap would have led back in hearts if he had A52 and Gordon says usually would lead the 5 back - guess he's trying to figure out shapes|pg||

mb|2S|nt|kit: In closed room, North did well to rebid 2@C rather than some number of spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Meck would RDBL to show 4+@S   i NEVER thought about 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|joest: it is of course 'more flexible' and it works well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they'll back into the 44 @S fit|pg||
nt|kit: they are in force here, so seems like South can pass and North can bid 3@S -- must be 4 since no 2@S call last time.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX doesn't show @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And why not. Must be better to show at least nine of your cards rather than six|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I like 2@S only.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: i like 2@s as well notwithstanding this result|pg||
nt|kit: true -- if it definitely showed clubs -- but most pairs play at least semi-forcing NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I think the 2@cs was semi-forcing.  If I read the hand signals correctly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or get there right away|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I like raising my partner with any excuse, but I think that vul cohler does not have a 3d raise; he did well to just pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: When East leads one red ace, declarer will assume that he must hold the other red ace too. Not that this info is particularly useful.|pg||

nt|chorush: As it happens, EW chose the less fortunate suit to play in|pg||

nt|ritong: you might get one or two broken bones|pg||
nt|henryb:  Thid hand needs one of my Toronto opponent's favorite plays: the "intra-finesse"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: You could be cold for 5@C, and even 6, while playing the hand in 2@S. North has a two-suited hand with spades and clubs, not a one-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|kit: Not 100% valid inference about the other ace -- East might prefer to lead ace-doubleton rather than from some broken diamond suit|pg||
nt|chorush: the hands fit splendidly and the lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denied a 5-card suit, so 3@S was exactly 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually this concept of transfer raises came after i raised eric on Kx at the paducah regional in the mid-80s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it right?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he liked the idea of Hx raises with some hands but still wanted a "normal" raise available|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The number of flesh and blood kibs keeps increasing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Up to 17 or so.|pg||
nt|ritong: it also goes along with strong @c, right?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: no big deal since N/S make 3d.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: many in europe would reach 4@S on the e/w cards once a multi had been opened|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i didn't think acbl let kibs in this late in a round|pg||
nt|henryb:  at least needed it until N led the @d10|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: The problem with this approach is now what does he do?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd's failure to overruff doesn't necessarily mean that Boyd can't overruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is always an open room|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, walter, although an overcall limitates a hand as well|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chorush: It was unlikely, though not totally impossible, that 3 spades might be allowed through|pg||
nt|chorush: more likely that it would be down 1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: ruff a spade high, play a club and claim|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: wonder if double of 3@H would have let north avoid the suicidal lead|pg||

nt|ritong: 4@s has play|pg||
nt|ritong: but @d A is offside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think starting with Spingold Round of 32  and  Wagar [women's ko - with Beth Palmer a defender]  usually just finals|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: Becker also passed  --  i thought Robinson would try 1@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong club auction to 3nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  Tim Seres came back once from a big Paris event - he said, "In Europe, if they don't lead a doubleton, they don't have one". contributed by a kibitzer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C looks like Bergen raise of 4+fit with normal values for 1-2|pg||
mb|1S|an|no major|nt|brolucius: He can make five side-suit winners, ruff a spade in his hand and score four of the remaining five trumps.|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s obviously treated as forcing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: Robinson will have to rebid 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@H is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You run the risk of never seeing dummy in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: spade lead might be interesting, since obviously declarer can't finesse|pg||
nt|joest: east on lead|pg||
nt|kit: South hand should bid 4@H I think -- KQJ109x is called trumps|pg||
nt|kit: If 3NT were right, North likely would have bid it directly|pg||
nt|kit: now, will Boyd quit or bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will bid 3@H, though not sure he should.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chorush: It's important to have agreements here. Most, I think, play 3H as the weakest hand while pass is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler alerted the pass.  Berk did not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oops -- and dummy is dead|pg||
nt|larrymori: tough call, misfits shud stay low|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other room   P-1@S//2@D-2@H//2N-3@H//P|pg||
nt|kit: AJxx an ugly suit to lead from, and gets the usual result.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so EW must play 2-way Drury|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will try to slide the 9 of hearts through -- he doesn't want it to get covered.|pg||
nt|chorush: The friendly hearts should let this one home|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks about minimum openings.  Boyd: "We aren't shy about 11 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: hands."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Interesting play problem here for cohler in 3 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: for berk that is :)|pg||
nt|chorush: The hand lies very favorably for NS but it will still be no picnic to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who wonder what is meant by Maximal DBL   Palmer's situation was one where it would apply   3@S is just competitive [non-invite] and DBL with no room would have been the ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ONLY way to invite game|pg||

nt|chorush: Good play by Landenm makes life tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually al, they may play both X and pass as different game tries since 3@C forced them to 3@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: I don't think Robinson will be ducking any hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no reason to expect such good hearts, for a NV weak two-bid. So, he tries 3NT in the hope that South has something like @SJ-x or at least @S10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
nt|roswolf: some specs are surprised that west didnr open 1@D 3rd in hand - they must have had red meat for lunch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: I am really surprised about what happened in the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has the problem of being locked out of both hands.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: 3NT should only be 'very wrong' when partner has mis-bid. South has just about what he has shown with regard to supporting a 3NT contract.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: Becker should cash the third diamond before playing on clubs, so defense won't have a diamond exit -- but not many players think of this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Some discussion confirming that the first @d play by Boyd was USDC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kit is correct, but it will not help declarer here when West has A10xx in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: it may help for damage control|pg||

pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell shows his cards and asks about the finesse.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Boyd has to be enjoying the way things have gone|pg||
nt|kit: Actually I don't think Robinson should have repeated the finesse -- Surely Meckstroth would have covered from Qxxx, and Rodwell might have ducked his queen.|pg||
nt|chorush: I agree with that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry -- lost the play.|pg||
nt|chorush: When the 8 appeared on round 2 finessing again was not indicated|pg||

nt|kit: sensible lead -- heart or club lead figures to cost more than to gain.|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Interesting decision for cohler whether to rebid 2s here.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room   1N-2@C//2@D-end|pg||
nt|ritong: winning 4 imps when it is right in the end, but risking the dreaded double game swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, but if you say that you play weak-jumps vulnerable, you have to bid on that hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: It looks like the do something intelligent double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Normally with balanced hands and 5 card majors, you just pass 1nt with 9 or 10 points, hoping that partner will be able to win enough tricks on power.|pg||
nt|chorush: Personally, I would have bid 2 spades with the south hand but i am a big fan of raising on 3 with reasonable hands|pg||
nt|leo lasota: However, with a small doubleton AND Ax in another suit, I think 2S is the winning call.|pg||
nt|chorush: Brek may have lost his best chance to make this when he didnt put up the queen. Not that he should as a normal rule but the rest of the hand lies atrociously for his side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen giving this play a really good think....|pg||
nt|joest: well third hand high saves the day|pg||
nt|joest: if he plays low Berk has seven tricks right now|pg||
nt|chorush: If he plays low Berkowitz will happily take +90. If he plays the 10 I think Berk will return the 9 giving EW a chance to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: which costs a tad more|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Is there any sensible way to reach the good 6@d?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few pre-empts are without risk, but that doesn't stop them from being effective, of course.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: So they did survive it, but South had to make a good guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding was well judged around the table.|pg||
nt|kit: defense in trouble now -- club shift difficult to find, and probably too late anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now rodwell has entry to dummy for misguess in @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|kit: Rodwell knows spades splitting, so setting that up first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will probably punt with another diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: Contract will hinge on heart guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd jumps into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will likely misguess hearts due to Boyd's original pass -- provided Boyd defends passively|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: the 3 should be suit preference for clubs |pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: if Robinson can conceal his AK of clubs, declarer might misjudge the strength and play him for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|joest: then again maybe not|pg||
nt|kit: well, so much for that idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was good for a few seconds!|pg||
nt|kit: Becker knows Robinson would never be leading a heart from queen, so he should go up ace in case Boyd has stiff queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will of course also be broadcasting from the Spingold (and Wagar, women), starting on Wednesday with the Round of 32 in the Spingold|pg||
nt|kit: Admittedly difficult to construct a consistent distribution where Boyd has a stiff hearts, though|pg||
nt|brolucius: And East would have had to lead 3rd best from 4. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room, Becker led @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: Now the defense pretty much can't get it wrong|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO all the evidence pointed to getting hearts wrong. I would have|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: Boyd will get the heart count from his partner on 2nd round of hearts, so he will know not to duck.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|leo lasota: he may actually make 2 here with pettis pitching a spade.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson makes it easy for the defense.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd must know the whole hand now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: is anyone else surprised that Rodwell   a) bid 2@C opposite known 17-18   and/or b) rebid 2N instead of PASS 2@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||

nt|henryb:  Perhaps 1@s-2@s-3@c short suit game try - 3@d - 4@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: very nice fitting hands here for N/S.  South should make a slam try in hearts and of course North will accept with good 21.  |pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|roswolf: on bd 5 the icemen bid 4@S over a weak 2 opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: well that's one way to approach it|pg||
nt|kit: This could lead to exactly the same result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson took his time before pasing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: passing|pg||
nt|kit: 5@S by Spector, for sure, and Robinson will save in 6@C|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson will now big eight clubs over 7@s|pg||
nt|joest: bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector 1st seat PASS |pg||
nt|chorush: How many clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: 4 looks right to me|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Berkowitz will use Texas and RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: And it might be a good save, as it was in other room|pg||
nt|joest: then again there is always that fear of pushing them into a making slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker asks about the double.|pg||
nt|joest: but yes you gotta remove this|pg||
nt|kit: Double shows extra offense and defense, but still seems clear for Robinson to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: right you were|pg||
nt|kit: And Rodwell will take a possibly good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: good prediction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes, he is subtracting from his partner's defense.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C wasn't surprising...  2NT shocked me speechless|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: now spector with a double of his own|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see if RKCB is 4@s or 4N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S10 is rusinow...  may have a higher honor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: He will claim later that it is an obvious Lightner Double.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: He'll find a 7th trick here.  The @C10 is placed well for declarer in that EW can't threaten to run th esuit.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Spector pretty much has to double I would think -- and can becker find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|henryb:  If anyone wants an illustration of the intrafinesse, go to the other room and run the movie of board 5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boyd will be disappointed to learn that he has lost IMPs.|pg||
nt|kit: Wow -- so Spector saves 5 IMPs by not doubling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny way to gain/lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector sighs and shakes his head when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|joest: cheaper to take the save in 6@h :) -- which makes on a club lead|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson has to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: Best kind of save is a make|pg||
nt|joest: two without?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: A lead I think is pretty obvious looking at his hand, but he thought otherwise.|pg||
nt|kit: Partner opened 1@D, he has majors bottled up -- where does declarer get tricks but trumps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set they had an even better sacrifice  6@CX making|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he could counter a trum by starting spades|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: chances are declarer will try to steal a trick before revealing his @ds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: Only a trump lead keeps the contract from immediately being made, and I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|joest: low club gives it up at once|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That's what North bid.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|joest: well there's always the @CQ ira|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|chorush: sorry Jack:) I did neglect that one|pg||
nt|ritong: although, @c K(x) onside and he s home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [he'll correct me if i'm wrong]  Rusinow = 2nd of touching honors   so when Walter says higher honor that means a non-touching sequence of  AJT or KJT   not QJT, which would lead ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack|pg||

nt|leo lasota: You can only wonder if berk was holding his breath when he saw the ace diamonds hit the table.  Fortunately, Cohler had him covered.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: good question!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I did -- wait a minute -- oh..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Short break at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: What I think happened is that Cohler is used to playing 4S as rkc and over that 5H would show 2 with the Q. Just a guess. Berkowitz and Cohler are not regular partners|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe you are correct Ira.|pg||

nt|larrymori: this is a big steal of vul game|pg||
nt|chorush: Very big theft|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  24  the other room   P-1@C-DBL-3@C//DBL-5@C-P-P//5@D-DBL-end|pg||
nt|larrymori: question of system, if X is 3 suited takeout and 4nt is 2 suited takeout he has to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he does |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|joest: you are also endplayed after 1NT if partner bids 2C or 2S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 3@D over 2@C show this type?|pg||
nt|joest: it does if you agree so :)  I have seen folks play that fit-showing as well|pg||
nt|kit: spector considering making this not such a dull deal after all|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what 3@h was|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very thoughtful of him to consider the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|joest: but it appears Spector treated as natural|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a shot to get to 3NT if partner bids it, planning on signing off at 4@S otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Unfortunately, I cannot read the notes from here.|pg||
nt|joest: the fact that he is still thinking however is threatening to 'undull' this deal :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The Commentators' Curse strikes again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did think about 3@H as a no-trump problem, but it seems a bit risky. 4@S is the world's safest rebid.|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||
nt|brolucius: no-trump probe..|pg||
nt|kit: 4 of a previously bid major is to play.  Period.  End of story.  A very good agreement all partnerships should have.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: was going to be an artificial response but after the X the responses are natural|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 4@c is not superclear|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: potential double fit; favorable vulnerability.  5@d seems auto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I hope you can take a joke."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is not a hand that favors the law of total tricks.  E/W can be held to 3 hearts, N/S can be held to 3 diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That was a lot of thinking for a pass.|pg||
nt|joest: and if the club king were onside we'd be asking why he didn't bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Interestingly, the Walsh approach would have led to a bit slower auctionand NS might never have found diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: after all, pard bid 3@d voluntarily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, they get to 4@S. No harm in entertaining us a bit along the way.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, no swing -- but at least it wasn't dull for the specs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: well defence have a blueprint of this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sontag says the double shows diamoonds, at least "I think so" -- Berk:  no low level doubles are penalty; try to remember that|pg||
nt|roswolf: might not help them of course:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Landen is taking it all a bit seriously at the other table, rebidding 4@S.|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will likely shift to a trump here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Hoping declarer has 3 clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly a vlaid point, but you could keep making his hand better with the same distribution til he had to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that doesn't sound right Larry -- a) equal level conversion may apply [so 5@C-5@D]  b) DBL gets left in a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and c)  meckwell are notorious crooks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: But they are very pleasant about it at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: Bridge-wise, if you reach into you rpocket to get your wallet you may shake hands with one of them|pg||
nt|larrymori: I do not know their agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd asks about the style of weak two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at favorable -- implies 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "A wide variey of hands."|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|larrymori: he did not want to ask earlier revealing strength, so pass or X had to be fairly quick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: This is reasonable also|pg||
nt|ritong: so, expecting @d Hxxxx and an other feature is not overoptimistic|pg||

nt|ritong: which might help them to make 4@c, so..|pg||
nt|ritong: well it s easier from upthere|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Playing 'ace for attitude, king for count' leads, East would start with the @CK and discover that West had an odd number of clubs, clearly five on this bidding. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: making 3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c8|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||

nt|kit: he has seen his partner's minimum opening bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was supposed to show 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|chorush: most experts play 2H as a constructive raise here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzfc: Thumbs down on the spade raise from both sides of the screen.|pg||
nt|joest: well if that's so that is what I would bid with this hand b/c 2@s is reserved for horrible hands|pg||
nt|chorush: If NS do, the Cohler doesn't think his hand is constructive. I disagree|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Cohler has tough decision whether to show constructuve values or not; an ace and a king are very promising, but 34333 shape is not.|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect he showed nonconstructive or we would not be waiting for Berk's bid|pg||
nt|joest: well I play 2@h as constructive and believe me I would bid 2@s on so much less than this I couldn't afford to take the chance with 2@s|pg||
nt|chorush: I'm definitely with you Jack. 2S could be a 4-3-3-3 3count|pg||
nt|joest: "constructive" does not mean "limit raise"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I agree with both of you, the constructive 2h raise would be my choice as well.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: and the 2@D raise makes North's 2@H call more competitive rather than constructive|pg||
nt|chorush: no, it just means a hand that if you compete with 3 spades later you wont be finding a Yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lee Trevino [and others]     The more I practice, the luckier I get|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|chorush: so much so that Meck has a maximum|pg||

nt|ritong: fortunately larry cohen is not in the audience anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I guess there is a good reason he is playing and I'm doing the Vugraph. :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Both Souths did well to raise the hearts on their moderate hand. Obviously the right move. |pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: berk "I denied 4 spades"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Provided robinson reads the lead as a singleton -- he should, since South marked with short spades.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Don't most people play 2@H as a one-round force here? If it isn't, then double|pg||
nt|kit: not clear whether to return a trump or a spade here -- probably spade, playing partner for Kx is best|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 3H was passing the buck|pg||
nt|joest: yeah well I don't like 3H for two reasons|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, sometimes it is worth considering how aggressive your partner's bidding style is.  As we see, Berkowitz still made the aggressive game try so the game is still reached.|pg||
nt|joest:  1: you are torturing partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57   Berkowitz 5@D West|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think he will lose a @h to try the @c finesse|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|joest:  2: if partner gives you a slow 3@s you have an ethical night mare|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I really like reason  1 just on principle.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I don't think most people play 2@H forcing|pg||
nt|joest: well I offered two just in case :)|pg||
nt|chorush: exactly Jack. Both very important points. IMO is 2 spades was not constructive, Cohler had the all-time quick 4 spade bid after the 3 club try|pg||
nt|henryb:  Notice that 2@h is only one down. Raise on 3!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|nt|joest: I know I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then you have to double|pg||
nt|kit: why?|pg||
nt|kit: if partner passes 2@H I'm probably high enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H constructive, but NF|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding you may want to compete against 2@D with quite a modest hand including fair hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play the same with no interference, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- here 2@H isn't necessarily so construcive|pg||
nt|kit: yes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: but as I said, here 2@H isn't necessarily constructive.  With no interference, it is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many bridge teachers say 'Change of suit forcing', but I have always thought that this is because it is much easier to teach! |pg||

nt|chorush: Well, the law of total tricks got massacred a couple of hands ago. this time it's going to be Goren's "26 HCPs make a game"|pg||

nt|ritong: general strength and shape are not very appealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Spector upgraded with the spade fit and got to the game.  Now he has to make it.|pg||
nt|joest: I think Brian SEnior devoted a chapter to it in his book "The Transfer Principle"|pg||
nt|joest: and Jeff Rubens has written about them off and on a while back in The Bridge World|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker takes a bit of a walk as dummy for the first time in this session (I think).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens wrote about them in the Bridge World, April 1981|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's excellent to bid the heart game. 3@H must have been bid on the partial spade fit. Well done.|pg||
nt|joest: wow " a while back" = 30 years.  I should have known.  :(|pg||
nt|kit: How should he play this?  Not clear at all.  Maybe just straight crossruff, which needs only queen of hearts onside or possibly a blockage|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell had to guess how many hearts and/or spades his partner had|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: 3 makes, albeit with a litle discomfort when diamonds do not come home for 5 tricks, from the North side.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: it appears he guessed wrong as both 2@H and 2@S probably down 1 -- but surely percentage action.|pg||

nt|leo lasota: it is important to have solid agreements with your partner there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Four hands to go and the teams are a vul game swing apart.  Great match!|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong artificial|nt|Walddk2: It has been an interesting set so far, although I am sorry to tell David that we may get a 1NT contract here|pg||
nt|kit: a case could be made for a 2@S raise, or even a 2@C rebid, as well as 2@H and 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen seems a bit annoyed.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently 1@c is standard. 2@h was a transfer|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|an|good 12-14|nt|daman: as I mentioned earlier     East is an extremely fast player     we are now 3 boards ahead of the Open Room|pg||
nt|othered1: even with bad trump break, 6@S is a good contract|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: Spector: 'Let me play them in future, will you?'|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room east ventured a brave 2@h call here|pg||
nt|joest: but Jeff Meckstroth has never been timid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Time to put on some tea, David.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 1NT might be pretty interesting I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David will be back in 10 minutes after he has had his shower. He always takes a shower when we display 1NT contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Your least favourite place to play.|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is obviously 100% forcing|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|daman: sorry   East is the fast player |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|brolucius: Miles too late for tea, Ross. We are well and truly into the alcohol zone.|pg||
nt|kit: Rusinow leads and ace from AK vs. NT -- king would be power lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|joest: so it looks like king is the 'power lead' (i.e. unblock partner) which forces pairs to lead the queen from holdings like this (assuming one is going to lead an honor)|pg||
nt|joest: too fast kit|pg||
nt|kit: 6 is upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact I will go downstairs and put the remaining half of yesterday's bottle into the ice box. brb.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell hoping his partner has a 2@S call instead of a 3@C call.  His prayers weren't answered.|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west has methods to unwind that hand after 2@C rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N would show 2-places-to-play, so maybe that translates to 3@C = 5+|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kit: Robinson can deduce declarer doesn't have A10x, or he would not have ducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He puts cognac in the refrigerator?|pg||
nt|kit: And partner can't have Axx and play the 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Roland, the British have some strange notions.|pg||
nt|kit: So it was safe for him to continue with king of hearts -- he failed to work that out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I have noticed, Ross|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry.  5 boards. :)|pg||
nt|daman: West|pg||
nt|othered1: Can someone translate this auction?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I think Berk has shown 4-3-3-3 with 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: board 58  [2@HW-1]  Robinson in 3@D North|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is normal, with 26 hcp  looks like a battle of undertricks|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 4333|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|leo lasota: Many options for pettis to consider on this hand.|pg||
nt|ritong: given the layout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C asks|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@c = 16+ unbalanced, 18+ balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@H = 3343|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N = 8-13, no 5 card major, balanced|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT = 8-13 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c relay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = italian transfer stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 level bids would show the 8-10 shapes|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: i'm told prayers are always answered -- but usually the answer is NO|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can continue diamonds and get a ruff with his 4 of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And the diamond shift gave declarer  7|pg||
nt|chorush: He will be doing well to make this, after he finds 4 spades in South he is likely to play North for diamond length|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler did well to stay off the diamond lead -- with only one trump|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT+ the 11-13 shapes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: battle of undertricks     sounds like a title for .....  <fill in the blank>|pg||
nt|ritong: so, declarer is known with @c AQ and @s Q|pg||
nt|ritong: also, 4 @hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|brolucius: I heard that. It is the rest of the world that is strange. |pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should -- reason Robinson didn't lead heart was likely to be that he had the ace.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Yes, Cohler has hidden from pettis the nature of his distribution.  Unlikely that Pettis expects North to be 1714.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: no bidding; no singleton lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I think Pettis will need mirrors to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There are mirrors in the room, but they are too high to see any other hand. :)|pg||
nt|chorush: play could also have been fascinating had Cohler led his diamond, After taking a ruff with the spade 9, he could not return a heart because that would give the trump show away|pg||
nt|daman: 5@D asks for the @S Queen|pg||
mb|6C|an|king of diamonds + SQ|nt|ritong: and presumably 2@s, but @s count is not 100% sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|leo lasota: Believe me, Pettis is certianly someone that I would like to have declare a hand like this. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: cool auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now he just has to make it|pg||
nt|othered1: well done and partial trump elimination will let west score this, ruffing the 4th @H with dummy's @S2|pg||

nt|bigtrain: y|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And now they start with relays en masse|pg||
nt|brolucius: The deals have not seemed particularly swingy as they appeared on the screen. Amazing that the score is 40-7.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is not a great slam, particularly not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I was thinking that too - last board was the first double digit swing, but most of the little swings have been one way |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a risk of a club ruff|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You can take three discards and lead towards the club. Not so bad.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depends on @CA onside, doesn't it?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A diamond lead would give you the chance of trying for 4 club discards.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not as good as that, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because on a heart lead you need to take all your pitches first|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then if they stand up lead a club up and hope there is no ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: South might have led a singleton club.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pratap asks for explanations. Baldursson: I was asking through 2NT - he has 7 spades & a stiff heart; 4@d was an artificial slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's clearly below 50%|pg||

nt|chorush: The doubler may survive to regret it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: walter   the correct spelling is OY|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm another tricky hand|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|nt|brolucius: Not suitable for Michaels. 1@H, perhaps?|pg||
nt|joest: I would agree.  disparity too great.|pg||
nt|joest: you'll bid hearts and then bid spades later, treating spades like a four card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Yes, 1@h.  I haven't put it up yet.|pg||
nt|chorush: 2D seems like a make to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Totally unsuitable for Michaels for various reasons in my view|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@s on @c finesse|pg||
mb|2S|an|solid suit|nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- other than Warren, who is upset that this match is so close|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: He had 8 facing a strong 1@C, so had to get to game.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C reasonable, but gives Rodwell another chance|pg||
nt|ritong: spector team likely ahead by 2 at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Would not surprise me if Meckwell try 4 hearts on the EW cards on this hand as well.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: meck gets another chance|pg||
nt|kit: big decision here -- I think he'll get it right|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s seems too little in a limited opener, 3@d? What do you guys think?|pg||
nt|chorush: If that Kx was naywhere else he would pass, but not spades|pg||
nt|chorush: I would have bid 3D, letting partner bid 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I'm waiting on  Boyd.  Meck bid 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = artificial game force  [2-way checkback]|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chorush: unfriendly lie of the cards here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: will take work to just go down one.|pg||
nt|joest: is cohler more likely to underlead the club ace or the QJ?|pg||
nt|chorush: low probability of either|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very low shot of either|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: After that rebid, presumably a solid suit, west with all those winners will drive to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East hand is now great, he wil think, with a singleton in South's suit. He can expect no wastage.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still has to make 3@H on 59 for that to occur|pg||
mb|5S|an|asks for club control|nt|joest: wonder if they would have stuck it out had Spector brought out the hammer :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't really. Boyd could have hearts stopped twice|pg||
nt|joest: i understand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if it does go 3@D-3@H   then what?|pg||
nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|chorush: I would make whatever my choice of games bid was;|pg||
nt|kit: his 5@C call far from obvious, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: much more likley to be robinson by 3|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: then 3@s|pg||
nt|larrymori: the other choice was 4@s|pg||
mb|6S|nt|joest: but still I wonder :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double might frighten them into a making club contract, from South's point of view.|pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is one of those hands as declarer that you wonder if you think long enough, perhaps I can have the queen of hearts added in to my hand. :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: on the previous hand a spec asks what is the correct odds line -anyone care to calculate it?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Rodwell will have a plan upon seeing dummy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: oops forget they weren't vulnerable so likely robinson by 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: i never argue on decimals:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that lead helps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: On the @H ruff-out line, north needs to hold at least 3@H.  Other lines, I think, require more.|pg||
nt|henryb:  This hand is simple: on a red suit lead you cash 4 red winners and lead a @c to the K|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: If declarer manages to make this, he may shunt the 6@C doubled contract off the front page of the bulletin.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: stiff jack in south seemed more likely than stiff king in north.  I like Boyd's try there|pg||
nt|chorush: Rodwell going to defend this one quickly. Take first 3|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club, two shakes on the top diamonds and down one|pg||
nt|joest: two rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|chorush: He might be considering whether and how he could handle a stiff quack in north|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis still trying to imagine a miracle layout where he may make.  He may ruff club, cash AK diamonds, then play ace and king hearts hoping for QJ tight in the North hand.|pg||
nt|joest: yes. in fairness he is not giving up on making this|pg||
nt|joest: and if he plays a heart up, Cohler will split just to be sure and play will slow down further :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: If South holds honor fourth in trumps and north has the stiff jack or queen, the hand cannot be made if we agree that spades are 42, with south having no more left.|pg||
nt|joest: and Meckwell has matched the contract again|pg||
nt|chorush: for a stiff quack based on what he has seen, North would be 4-1-3-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Pettis apologizes for taking the time....|pg||
nt|chorush: and he can't handle that|pg||
nt|leo lasota: in which case north still has Jx spades and declarer will have one too many losers to avoid|pg||
nt|chorush: so he has to loook for doubleton QJ. that he CAN handle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 60 where Rodwell held 3N to down 1,  Robinson in 3N also, but Puppet Stayman auction concealed his @H length   Cohler led @HQ   now we wait|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were 'forced' into it after a strong club and Rodwell showed 5-7 with support|pg||

nt|chorush: Could Boyd have thought his pass was forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Surprise!  Meckwell reached 4@s in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think most players would raise the spades on that. Except strict followers of the Ron Klinger Losing Trick Count.|pg||
nt|kit: my rule is:  no aces + no kings + no singletons + no voids = no bid|pg||
nt|joest: = no fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held a doubleton club, the game would be OK.|pg||
nt|joest: defense would have to seriously awry to let this in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even without it hearts could come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|joest: south would need Kx or Kxx of hearts + trumps breaking|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Disaster here for E/W.|pg||
nt|othered1: It depends on how he read the opening lead.  someone with Sontag's table presence, even against good opponents, will get that right most of the time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @SJ = 4th best  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Goren said you were supposed to lead 4th from longest & strongest, right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on sontag's failed slam - lots of interesting comments -ty all specs - the majority feel his line was right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chorush: well, if he had overcalled one heart he probably would be defending 3NT in the manner Leo described|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead trumps against doubled partials, except when dummy has just 1 trump :)|pg||

nt|ritong: but do we make this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we?|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this doesn't make by E, but @h|pg||
nt|warrens:  @h's block if played by W|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, not vulnerable|pg||
nt|ritong: good point W|pg||
nt|bigtrain: personally i'd be satisfied to get to 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks -- i was wondering how to phrase that Walter|pg||
nt|ritong: the " normal" choice here is low @h|pg||
nt|ritong: playing south for H10, twice more likely than KQ|pg||
nt|ritong: but south overcalled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then Palmer has 3 choices --  the normal choice, a fast losing choice and a slow losing choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Declarer still thinking about the hand and then Meck needed to take a quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: break.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Beth -- the middle choice is rarely chosen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room has caught up -- everyone still confused about the result for 60|pg||
nt|ritong: so what do "we" know|pg||
nt|ritong: south overcalled, but was a passed hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: after no club lead, declarer has a real chance.  He plays on hearts, and what does North do?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he showed his hand and right or wrong it seems like Robinson has to double or bid 5@s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: There is no right or wrong answer to the question of whether Boyd's pass is forcing.  The important thing is for partnerships to have firm and unambiguous rules, and follow them.|pg||
nt|joest: now there can be some serious damage|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 300 if they take ruffs|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler coudl be afraid he is dealing partner ruffs withnatural trump tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: 3NT would likely have had a better chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with @DJ onside|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift allows this to make|pg||
nt|kit: so does ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: either a passive heart or underleading the diamond needed|pg||
nt|joest: definitely not easy|pg||
nt|kit: heart exit is okay I think|pg||
nt|kit: and of course low diamond is most successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK certainly looks attractive, though. He will do well to avoid it.|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room south got a diamond raise in (from where?) but here no bidding from south|pg||
nt|kit: Becker would have been better off leading king of clubs on opening lead this time -- of course, on a different day that could cost the contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfc: Play was very quick once Jeff got back.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: would you know for sure in your partnerships if the pass is forcing?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|kit: and the swing goes back to Robinson|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I am not surprised by that. The winning defenses were very hard to find and just happened to work, I would say.|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson with only three swings in favor: but all whoppers|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chorush: Assuming they play unusual v unusal, boyd had a way to show limit or better with spades. Most likely, taking that rougte and bidding 4 spades would be forcing|pg||
nt|joest: of course Pettis isconvinced AJxx of hearts at his right|pg||
nt|chorush: That is a mistaken point of view. No one compelled partner to shift toa diamond if he didnt want to ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis has 5 tricks here if he takes them.|pg||
nt|joest: a point Mr. Berkowitz might make in the post mortem :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: since he knows that south is likely short in diamonds and north is short in clubs, he should cash KQ hearts.  He will be pleasantly surprised for d2.|pg||
nt|joest: next door n-s on track to make 3NT so n-s need a   here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sQ|nt|chorush: or at least, that may be what Robinson thinks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|larrymori: start with he bid it to make so I do not think pass is an option|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|nt|kit: obviously that is what he thought -- but you can't "think" here -- you must know for sure.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|leo lasota: oh no|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: well if he cashes the heart ace and the jack doesn't drop he can get the whole club suit run on him|pg||

nt|kit: yes -- 3 double figure swings vs. 0, and match still very close|pg||
nt|chorush: If your partnership has a rule that there are no preempts over preempts, then maybe 4 spades should do the trick|pg||
nt|kit: there must be strict rules which cover this auction (and others)|pg||
nt|joest: yes they did have 800 coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There will be some post-mortems on that one -- on both sides, I think.|pg||
nt|chorush: Incidentally, are their more 1H overcallers than doublers here?|pg||
nt|joest: a very close and exciting match all the way so far|pg||
nt|daman: and now the penultimate board of the first session|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, 17+ bal|pg||
nt|kit: that is my rule -- 4@S not a preempt over a preempt, therefore bid to make voluntarily, therefore in force.  But I'm not guessing.  |pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 1@h i confess|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: As we were all saying.... an excellent raise by East on the first round!|pg||
nt|chorush: I would also|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another discussion to be made with all partnerships is if you play equal level conversion doubles with 4 spades and 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ GF|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2N=game force 4441@C/@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: thats me too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck can ask for shortness or set trump suit|pg||
nt|othered1: this may be the fastest played set on vugraph this year.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bigtrain: 3@D = natural 5+|pg||
nt|bigtrain: forget that 3@H = 3fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: need to look more carefully before typing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 62, Boyd did NOT bid with Meck's hand   will Berkowitz-Cohler find 5@C now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lucky slam here -- they won't get there after this start I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Meck will be more interested if partner has stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does ASK|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's where the ambiguous 1@C can make it tough for north to compete|pg||
nt|henryb:  But why does he want to bid again, Ed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On this hand, that is|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: What does 6+4+2 come to?|pg||
nt|kit: Should Becker open 1@S or 2@C?  Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|joest: partner could have spade queen, diamond queen, heart ace|pg||
nt|joest: but those values are hard to locate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4441@D|pg||
nt|kit: do they play rkc relay here?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess not needed -- Meckstroth can just set trumps with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL changes things -- but I bet it gives Meck MORE room|pg||
nt|joest: landen surprised tohear hearts bid at his left for sure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = asking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: choose not to ask|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT serious slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: Because with @C length in south, this could be a game-partial swing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: i don't think Becker is passing|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he might move now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open 1@S. It gets too messy after 2@C with 6-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL, i think after 3@D   4@C=RKC @H  4@D=RKC @S|pg||
nt|kit: Even with king of diamonds wasted Meckstroth can still picture possible perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he bid 3@H?  There clearly can be no value to playing 4-4 fit opposite the 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|chorush: Picturing perfectos can be an expensive experience. Hamman says "If you need the perfect hand, I don't have it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@H is a RELAY [not setting trump]   with DBL, we need Walter|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps to set up a RKC for hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod writing a lot of explanation to Robinson.|pg||
nt|joest: now Cohler would like to bid 2@c natural|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or a "why should they go down when I can" hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: at some point, Rod describes strength of hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: extremely unfriendly hand to declare for either side.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: blackwood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3keys|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: notwithstanding the breaks, you can get a lot of mileage in 2@c north-south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Thanks....I think."|pg||
nt|joest: where does he start? :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I have no clue. the only thing he probably likes about Coh;er's hand is the spade 9|pg||
nt|joest: and if he works diamonds, the jack will be an ominous sign|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|kit: So he will bid the slam|pg||
nt|joest: yes they are still mid auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: but if he asks about the trump queen, they might still hang short|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double surely means that West has the @DA and South has the @HA.|pg||
nt|kit: but partner might have xxxx of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HA is not such a good card, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: the double surely means only 1 diamond loser|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K ask|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|joest: he may duck this|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chorush: club 8 will eventually score|pg||
nt|leo lasota: queen clubs out of hand trick 2 would be my choice.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker thinks: '2-2 break at worst'.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: and it would be berk's choice as well. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: You are in good company. :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: yeah.  + partner might table Jxx or spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: So many IMPs riding on the lie of the cards. |pg||
nt|kit: good perecentage bid by Becker.  Unlucky about the double of 5@D.  Without that, I think Becker would have asked for queen of trumps and stopped.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what Rod said with DBL -- but they did nice job of stopping at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod: "trying to show some extras."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "This won't take long."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: landen has high hopes that his partner holds Jx in diamonds.  Unfortunately for him, berk has the second diamond, not pettis.|pg||
nt|chorush: this feels like if they offered Berk down 2 he would accept it|pg||
nt|joest: i know i would|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S = 1K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems counterintuitve for the hand with a void to be asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only Walter can explain what Meck's other options were|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chorush: Yes. It was very helpful for Meckstroth to know that Rodwell was specifically 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Amazing." -- when he sees the @c split.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, is 3NT a serious try?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, I see, you said so before, thanks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: they bid 6@s in the other room as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D doubled at the other table too...|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least it is fair if both teams bid (or do not bid) such a slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker shows his hand:  "Do the spades break?"|pg||
nt|kit: Note the clear victory for playing 0314 as opposed to 1430 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it;s usual for 3@S to be bid as an ask|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It surprises me that Becker did not ask for @SQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chorush: this is a hand where whoever is on lead wishes he were not|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true ira|pg||
nt|joest: i have a highconfidence level the ten of hearts comes next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't ever remember not usinf it before cuebidding...  maybe 3NT shows short @S with slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 3 IMPs difference now.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that would be consistent with other sytem structures|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, boyd had a choice of leads and got it wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did somebody order an electric storm for the phoenix area??    it has just been delivered over my house|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chorush: suddenly things have gotten a bit better|pg||

nt|chorush: he is gonna come close to making this|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, someone ordered an electric storm over this table|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D fineese followed by a @S back breaks squeezes up|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm old that Team Iceland has three former Bermuda Bowl winners.  South hasn't achieved that yet.|pg||
mc|9|nt|leo lasota: 8 clubs here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: true def has a counter for that|pg||
nt|ritong: real tough switch|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  more for communication to set up @D|pg||
nt|ritong: the only information he has is the @h length  perhaps some inferences|pg||
nt|warrens:  Club back and he ruffs out @D's to make.  @S back and it's over|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 times club and draw 1 heart|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Ross, our excellent operator in Toronto. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|joest: now that surprises me|pg||
nt|joest: pass risks a double part score swing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chorush: well he does have a stiff where partner opened but I hate to sell|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would not bid 2h at unfav with singleton in partner's openiong suit.  Very lucky that partner happens to have K10x of hearts this time, but there are many other holdings where you ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: may go for a big number.|pg||
nt|joest: your hand can get sealed off in 1NT and add five tricks or so to the pot in 2@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: yeah well life is a risk |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  as before   2@D=bal 8-10, no 5+ suit  3N=signoff|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Steve doesn't see it my way :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will be back after a short break, perhaps 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks.  I've had a great time.|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead would be quite successful here -- should South overcall 2@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We should not let the last hand go without noting that a double of a Blackwood 5@D response on the @DA is not necessarily a wise move. You can see how it helped North here, at both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tables. It is different when you double a cue-bid with a high card sitting over the cue-bidder's high card.|pg||
nt|joest: a spade lead gives this a rough ride|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like routine 3NT headed down 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not -- Robinson has 109 of spades, so he will be under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: After a heart lead this is no gimme|pg||
nt|ritong: rodwell probably likes this auction|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chorush: Robinson not only has the 109 of spades but also the only diamond guard|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|kit: So heart lead, win, lose club hook, continue hearts, win, run clubs.  Robinson pitches 1 diamond, and then what?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: or even a heart lead and spade shift.  But difficult to fault club lead when hitting partner with just ace of clubs can be instant set.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|s8|nt|leo lasota: very true, but if the likely gain from bidding may be a double partial swing, while the downside is a potential telephone number, pass seems right.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Berk:  I suggest the king|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|kit: Declarer will still have to sweat North having ace of hearts since the spades will block, but all is well.|pg||
nt|joest: other room: heart lead + spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: that is unweighted for frequency|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Ross.  Great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: My pleasure. :)|pg||

nt|leo lasota: Ross :)|pg||
nt|chorush: thanks all. the fourth quarter looks like a real barn burner. We should resume in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It's OK, Leo -- I've been called worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 2 IMPs difference (if the scores are correct).  Don't change the channel.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's pretty loud suit preference @C4  and Cole obliges|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chorush: so I think this hand is makeable but needs some guessing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: whoa   last board of the 1st half   restart scheduled to begin in about 2 hours|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Robinson will have to pitch a spade|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Well, it was an entertaining session - very enjoyable. No need to complain about the dull deals on this occasion.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: very nice|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: I will certainly be back when the Spingold starts on Wednesday - one of the best events of the year.|pg||
nt|kit: Bud will Rodwell play for this, or play Boyd for Kx of spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe somebody on site can scope out scores in the LM Pairs|pg||
nt|kit: Now spade to jack, and when honor appears he will rethink.|pg||
nt|kit: I would expect he will get it right and play for this layout.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: he needs to play on spades to have any chance, so spade hook must be on.|pg||
nt|chorush: Robinson would always play spade 9 or 10 from 109xx so there is a guess involved|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson might have started with 109xx, QJxxx, Jx, Kx and discarded exactly the same way.|pg||
nt|chorush: Would you cash the diamond ace to see if, perhaps the diamond K has been blanked?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- spade hook first, then diamond to ace|pg||
nt|kit: spade hook always a must|pg||
nt|chorush: right, that will occur anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: however, 4@h is not cold|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|kit: now diamond to ace, and here we will be|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i forgot to credit George "DaMAN" Holland |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all specs for watching. We will be back soon with the second quarter|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|nt|kit: As pointed out, Robinson would (should!) always falsecard from the remaining holding of 109x, so 9 of spades not necessarily honest|pg||
nt|kit: He knows (or can assume) Robinson has the 10, but that doesn't solve the problem.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30 [our 5@D-4]   Becker playing a quiet 4@S EAST  after an unusual vs unusual auction|pg||
nt|chorush: Note that Boyd played the spade 6 and kept the 2, perhaps trying to influence Rodwell that Robinson was retaining the 2|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Robinson doesn't have to have king of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell gunts in frustration and dives back into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which gets us to      this is now a 34 board matcch|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's jack of diamonds might have been his last diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell: "Feels like a coin toss."|pg||
nt|kit: so Rodwell doesn't have the count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd: "Canadian or American."|pg||
nt|kit: he has the heart count, yes, but that isn't enough to tell him the shape|pg||
nt|chorush: well, there are more 5-3-3-2 hands than 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|8|nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  And why shouuld you credit him? Just because he makes more comments per square inch than most other people?|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: see you all in 25mins or so|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
