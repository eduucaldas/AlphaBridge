nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
nt|kaapo: A quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco might have promised stronger hand than this with his bidding, or might be just normal youngsters friskines on both parties|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they need a good win now if they want to chalenge Israel....good for moral as well|pg||

nt|andreasw:  Good switch not giving declarer a chance to make:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||

nt|bebechira: may be too much work :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ybob: now @H to discard later @D|pg||
nt|bagman: Kytömaa's opening was a bit on the light side considering the position and vulnerability but he's not going to be badly punished|pg||

nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||

nt|zebutin: ending was interesting, could have played @H suit at the end and maybe have something good come up...|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems here is another 3nt, this time most likely making with 3@C+ 4@S+@D and 1-2 @H tricks...with @D lead might make even more diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
nt|liraren: natural weak 2@d|pg||
nt|ybob: X and over suit at low level, bids @D |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most teams playing in 3N board 3 it seems|pg||
nt|runnerup: here nobody can make anything big -perhaps not even any little|pg||
nt|arigun: tablonun uzerinde istediginiz kategoriye tiklayip canli sonuclara bakabiliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club with transfers for NS, right?|pg||
nt|antoniz: sorry -2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in West already in 3nt....QD lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C some Bergen raise ?|pg||
nt|tez: 5 de kalmýþ öbür masa:(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes  a lot of trf :)|pg||
nt|bambik: to wunika z tzw rozluznienia szansa ze piki 3-0 jest minimalna ale mozna sie nad nia zastanowic|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @h4+|pg||
nt|stevedr: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4 piki skurczybyki|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: Missing all TOP honours , I would definitely hesitate to Open a weak two in first seat  |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden seems to have given up strong club and shifted to this system instead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes its the new swedish club ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||
nt|ybob: pass works fine to collect 200|pg||
nt|ybob: and probably down 1 in 4m|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla will pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead from N? i might prefer passive @S|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D pictures most likely behind declarer, Jx doesn't look promising, and A10x isnt going anywhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: or thats my thinking on lead anyway :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||
nt|rado: French top player Alain Levy recommends to seek for Major lead when unbid Majors at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: interesting lead|pg||
nt|bambik: na drugim stole po pierwszorecznym pasie i otwarciu przez Bytryna 1 trefl i interwencji 2 Pik Natalka golnela 4 kiery i 3 impy z niczego|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  She knows that partner doesnt have extras and 3@h|pg||
nt|friggi: 1@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, I believe EW use 3rd/5th leads so @D2 is usually from 5|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
nt|tez: 11 puanla þlem daveti bile yapmadý..ortakta iyi bir 22 bile olmaz diye düþündü|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||
nt|eleni: yes and then smolen|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H you most likely hit partners major suit, but he can't have too much points when you have 10...|pg||
nt|zebutin: but could work out with some combinations|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: @h küçük çýkýlabilirdi|pg||

pc|d2|nt|eleni: a lot depends on def.  as he has just 8 tricks, with correct guess in @s|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he should see that cl was not good there|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they need to right the ship |pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe beginning|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
nt|zebutin: but then J could cover, if singelton honor takes it 654 against H3 is enough|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: nothing fancy in the end: declarer likely to make his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: to play @c was like surrender here i think|pg||

nt|tez: iyi oluyor boyle cengiz..seyirciler mutlu oluyor biz bilemeyince:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I also play like that. Trouble with the method is that with 4-4 in the majors it's easy to lose the @S fit, especially if opponents interfere like this|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||

nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||

nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||

nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||

nt|rado: strange to buy contract at 2@D at other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||

nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for france|pg||
nt|zebutin: needs to quess @H right to have any chance at this... when J or Q drops its much better odz that  Rubino has other honor...but then you are always losing 1 @H trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||

nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||

nt|kaapo: NS may be able to jam the bidding a bit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks normal to reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe West can suggest 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks also normal to go down in 4@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: @Ds are foul so no direct 9 tricks at NT either|pg||
nt|zebutin: knows partner had short spades, so @S K seems like wasted value on this auction|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W might sacrefise in 4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to land in 4 @H here |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes , Dennis BIlde shifted to a @C in open room in trick 2 , made it "easy" , but 3x @H |pg||
nt|yusufb: iyi atak yaptý|pg||
nt|zebutin: this was maybe little unexpected development|pg||
nt|kaapo: This may not be a good way to do it, either|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
mb|4H|nt|eleni: right, but a @c has to be given early to opps|pg||

mb|p|nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|ybob: no if it, declares play AK @S and run @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: and win too|pg||
nt|frankbo: great score for sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||
nt|ahri:  12 tricks outside clubs (doubledummy)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its ok for 10 though..|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if 3 rounds in @h , declarer trump , play AK @s then @d no ? |pg||
nt|ybob: no way to defeat|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sac? |pg||
nt|sybarra: need more that guts |pg||
nt|andreasw:  depends on what dbl shows.. if it shows suit and lead or just lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||
nt|key1809: but all roads lead to Rome|pg||

nt|ritong: the fact that LHO is a passed hand is a factor imo|pg||
nt|ritong: he is less likely to balance|pg||
nt|lechcold: w tej chwili do 6 miejsca maj¹ tylko 2VP straty|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|gmarco24: i know, we beat in you in basketball, and (i really don't know how) tomorrow in bridge  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: heheheh|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -the question here is can you stay out off this nonvuln game|pg||
nt|tez: her an 4@h yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: fairly miserable part-score board|pg||
nt|lady007: this dutch team might be difficult to beat in basketball as well, they are all very tall|pg||

nt|arigun: defans yardim etse dahi 1@s artirir 9 lovede kalir|pg||
nt|kaapo: Denmark is currently 3rd, best of the Nordic countries|pg||
nt|stevedr: this will probably become a push|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|key1809: conservative pass by East here, knowing a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 6@h should be bid ,then you pay due of rotten luck|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  at the other table a pushy 4@H was bid - a bit too much|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
nt|yusufb: cok tehlikeli X bunlar|pg||
nt|kaapo: "antti è un nome maschile o femminile?" they ask in the open room. Without knowing any Italian my answer was "maschile"|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead looks like a good start for defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be difficult to stay out of 4 |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
nt|yusufb: fazla anlaþmalarý yok olanlar bile buralarda fire verirken|pg||
mb|2C|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||

nt|arigun: @DAK baslarsa defan durum sakat tabii|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edirse..ki edilir ..sonrasýný iyi ayarlamak lazým|pg||
nt|stevedr: altough i would be tempted to double with the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
nt|famus: first sign of  cheer for Danish fans with Italy going down in 4@S-- the declarer there lost trump control on a @H lead--he played !A and back-Danish yougster--took both @S and ...|pg||
nt|famus: forced a @h ruff|pg||
nt|bambik: widac ze Fisher nie czuje leku przed licytacja|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||
nt|liujing: and play @C AK|pg||
nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobry wist na -1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: EW play mini NT when vulnerable so West has max 9 HCP|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good stop:)|pg||
nt|stevedr: winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|stevedr: they need to hear, good stop, wins 15 :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: delikatnie to powiedzia³e Apku|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||
nt|tez: defans en zor yeri briçin..en zevklisi ayný zamanda|pg||
nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||

mb|3C|nt|yusufb: sacma bi iþ yaptý|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
nt|kaapo: Especially after this switch|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale widzê, ¿e lêku nie ma te¿ D¯essi jnr|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
nt|friggi: not the best switch|pg||
nt|stevedr: probably still push with h return|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be - 2 yes. a draw :P |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
nt|bagman: good time for espresso :)|pg||

nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||

nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
mc|10|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||

nt|famus: shud b careful not to release @hA|pg||
nt|galois85: yes 3@c asking major. What would you lead in N?|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||

nt|tomi2: I can tell you, if east makes this, north will eat the table, including the bidding boxes and his partner|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  so she could bid that to|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||

nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
nt|kaapo: How about 3NT? Denying a decent heart fit, or some kind of serious slam try?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is either trf w @h or trf to Nt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose a spade, a club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the hearts on the @DK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in W in 6NT already|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding 1NT istead of 2@S looks good, though probably they'd stop at 3 even if he raised|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 6 @s aint. some points for N/s if they get to 6@s|pg||

nt|famus: 5 back to italy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
nt|bagman: If N makes a help suit try in hearts, S has a very bad hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c oynatma bizi cengiz|pg||
nt|tez: yoruldum oluyor mu diye bakmaktan:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no idear if it is @sK that is missing and missing 2 aces with 8 cards fit and getting to slam would be very bad bridge:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S might be kick back|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if can show shortness in diamonds and invite that way, not much better then|pg||
pc|d6|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
nt|kaapo: In that case 5@C shows 1 or 4 keys... but maybe they weren't on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: must be the case|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
nt|tez: daha az yorardý|pg||
nt|arigun: seneye bize bi ekmek varmi tezcan bak bildim, gerci 2 sn olmadi ama :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin diyemedide eren dedi |pg||
nt|yusufb: madem 7 dicektin de niye 6@c dersinki|pg||
nt|arigun: masada 6@c hesitasyon varsa masaya ozel kuvvet gelebilir|pg||
nt|arigun: yani 6@c-6@d derken|pg||
nt|tez: 2/3 saniye düþünemeyecek miyim der selin|pg||
nt|arigun: perde de hesitasyon 20+ saniye kabul ediliyor bildigim adariyla|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So both player here thinks that they showed sometthing extras but partner didnt understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: Also facing a short suit trial in diamonds, S hand is not good for raise|pg||
pc|dK|nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
nt|tez: perdeli oynanýyor maçlar..dolayýsýyla direktörler çok prim vermiyor ona|pg||
nt|kaapo: Somewhat strange as 4@D really looks like the ace to North|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||

nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||

nt|andreasw:  unless ofcourse behinds a million imps and alot of imps needed:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s Q kuzeyde biliyo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The problem here that 3@h doesnt show a superhand|pg||

nt|runnerup: 3@d makes without @c ruff -but can you bid|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club and a transfer to spades. The usual style in Sweden is that 1@S shows either minimum and 3-card support or weak NT and 2-3 support|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: N should pass, if he doubles, S will remove and he does not want that|pg||
nt|timve:  wow|pg||
nt|veistikke:  also game 10. other room is 3!n +3 I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@Sx seems to be the contract they landed in|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it still right to lead the @d10 when playing the suit? Not intending to run, but hoping for cover?|pg||
nt|zebutin: it is atleast a good try|pg||
nt|bebechira: now to make it :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  so 4-36 unless director was called for something. :P|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahri:  wow|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  double game swing looming|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 2nt, starts of Leb,weak hands i presume|pg||
nt|eleni: interesting bid|pg||
nt|pinticus: X over 2nt could be penalty for one suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@C has the merit - it makes|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  11 from the top in @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  trump lead required to beat the 12th even|pg||
nt|cicus: E wit the axe|pg||
nt|ritong: again east tanking|pg||
nt|cicus: goes to my unbiased liking|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: this also makes with Kx of clubs onside |pg||
nt|timve:  D is agressive with east|pg||
nt|timve:  only west has his bids|pg||
nt|timve:  cause 3@H on a 4333 with 7|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, also with singleton club|pg||
nt|timve:  srr 3@C|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, cant blame west for bidding 4@s|pg||
nt|timve:  this board makes me feel old Marion|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  exactly|pg||
nt|bagman: sure it's right to play the !T but then you might go down against Q9 Jx|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  for sure|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes and there is nothing else to play for|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: i play X=negative in these situations; which will work nicely here!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Right|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eugenio123: why not 2@s?|pg||
nt|ahri:  would not expect that from them.|pg||
nt|ahri:  but it worked.|pg||
nt|mamos: still a long way to go in this match|pg||
nt|tejjyid: He;s looking for the RED X card - he doesn;t want West to take it out|pg||
nt|timve:  I thought I was a pretty agressive player|pg||

nt|tez: @c e|pg||
nt|kaapo: It seems Gazilli has enabled NS to stop low here|pg||
nt|zebutin: but at wrong contract|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that 1NT opening might have lead to 2@S via transfer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, wonder what 2@S would show from North|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably passed 2@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead was @H Q at other table...so most likely down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|key1809: he might be planning to s/o in 3c|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or @D|pg||
nt|famus: that shud make--a swing back to italy if 4@ds x makes which is most likely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chrisky: time to get some imps |pg||
nt|ritong: well the penalty aspect looks clear|pg||
nt|ybob: better if E put A @H and return @S ...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nice idea|pg||
nt|eleni: and there was no alert by N|pg||

nt|bebechira: welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hello folks|pg||

pc|h6|nt|offthebend: I suppose N didn't expect D Ace to be in the dummy - would rather have some other helpful card/s |pg||
nt|famus: so we still sit on a roller coaster--better still a pendulum|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer feels he should have a 100% line here ... he's just looking for it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: purple for ACTION|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lady007: lousy heart suit|pg||
nt|timve:  vulnerability|pg||
nt|timve:  is not good enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suspect @DA, D!J does it, because presumably South has overcalled with 5 hearts, so even if it loses to North, it's safe|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, KD sets up 7 tricks for the defence it seems|pg||
nt|bagman: With the West trumps, playing @DQ at trick one might have been a good idea; now getting the diamond might take some time|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zamêcz¹ go tymi skrótami:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|tejjyid: One of the things that makes bridge interesting is its limitations|pg||

nt|ahri:  he decided to keep them away of 4@s instead of pushing them into it. on this board, that was "wrong", on some other it will be "right".|pg||
nt|ahri:  all in all, 5 imps for croats|pg||
nt|ntmon: minor pickup for Italy on  12 - passed out here, undertricks by EW in OR|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  suddenly Sweden pulling away|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2 more  boards until the break!|pg||
nt|timve:  now its not strange to reach 4@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: unexpected +1 to F -in the end|pg||
nt|yusufb: bayanlarda takým sayýsý 10 yani oldukça az|pg||
nt|zebutin: and finesed again in @D, so seems like 6@Sx =|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Pekka should have been more careful in his advice|pg||
nt|bebechira: the very important test between Englsnd and India starting soon...and looking at the preview I did not notice that in brd 13 Robert went down|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|key1809: cl Q i mean|pg||
nt|eugenio123: interesting hand ! finally|pg||
nt|mamos: (through Greek pair in 4@H on 14 !!!!  4-2 |pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the hungarians have grinded it up|pg||
nt|famus: @c partial|pg||
nt|kaapo: When the @SA is no longer in the north hand, it's not any better time to lead the singleton...|pg||

nt|zebutin: yes...should have said "don't lead @D, or play it after you have taken trick"|pg||
nt|bagman: true :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: dbl shows 4+@h here|pg||
nt|tez: niye pas der eren|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eugenio123: I don't agree to open 1@d|pg||
nt|key1809: 6s/6nt there for the taking|pg||
nt|chrisky: an slam in the minors for ew|pg||
nt|ritong: be careful with 5332!|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  5@d as reached in the other room is the normal contract, and it is normal to go down one by finessing the diamonds|pg||
nt|tez: anlaþýlmaz..bu kadar temel biþey..dbl demedi|pg||
nt|yusufb: eren dikkat ettim elinde 9 puan olmadan konuþmuyor|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In open room did EW plays min nt 9-12HCP and thats why E easily could bid 1@s and not be worry to miss something|pg||
nt|kaapo: Anyhow, here we seem to have a perfectly natural 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H looks like a transfer to spades, maybe invite or better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wrong colours |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol..yea|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s out here is standard.. |pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 4@d is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: not sure double was the way to go |pg||
mb|2N|nt|chrisky: i think 15-17|pg||
nt|ritong: the law has its limits|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, never scorig more than 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: 5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Did North pass in tempo?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here implies that he's made a mistake with the 3@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx|pg||
nt|cicus: why was 1@H alerted?|pg||
nt|ritong: mystery|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smell the cards and open 1@S and after pd's 2@c/1nt bid 3nt ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  this is 21:9 for croats now if i am not mistaken, being on the "good" side of the VP scale for croats.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he said can be with 3 cards|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu pasýda kabul edilemez|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here 1D always unbal|pg||
nt|kaapo: With a weak hand 2@S is available|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H probably in multi-landy context showing a good overcall (my guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 7@s doesn't make last hand,only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: kontr deyip yaptýrsa mýydý?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He basically removed partner from the decision making with 3@D ... partner's never going to try 5@D after a weak raise like that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|key1809: oh ,clubs are not breaking|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other boring NT? Can miss it if @S lead from S|pg||
nt|ahri:  a regular 3NT hand here|pg||
nt|pinticus: 10 top tricks here|pg||
nt|yusufb: 29 nolu bordda 6@d dersek baya iyi olur 800 telafi ettigimiz gibi bayada sayý alýrýz ama batan yere gelirsek kotü|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ca³e szczêæie, ¿e obroñcy te¿ bêd¹ mieli tu swoje k³opoty|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||
nt|mamos: I think he should have started with @d   and then bid 6@c the next round|pg||
nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||
nt|famus: looks hopeless|pg||
nt|liujing: but not easy to stop with 25HCP|pg||
nt|famus: but for @s pips|pg||
nt|lechcold: dobra obrona w wykonani Francuzów|pg||
nt|lechcold: wykonaniu|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eugenio123: it's not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|key1809: north is not going to stop|pg||
nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|famus: restricted choices of lead produces the best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|frankbo: seems like he need one D trick to make|pg||
nt|famus: @d10 might produce the setting trick|pg||
nt|famus: from the bidding N wud soon work out Declarer's sing @D|pg||
nt|famus: as the play progresses and has to remain vigilant|pg||
nt|vasmar: stis 20 ta 78 imps einai 25-1|pg||
nt|kaapo: I haven't got or seen EW's notes on agreements so don't know for sure but quite likely|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can draw trumps, play a heart up and then set the diamonds (or diamonds first and heart then)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yusufb: partskora kolay kolay X demez zeynep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he had bid 4@D the first time, then partner will move on when that is correct ... and partner can also move on with 4@S on a 4-card suit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  both have showed their hands :) no more to say|pg||
pc|sT|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: West has 6-6  has had three rounds of bidding and hasnt managed to show one of his six card suits yet|pg||
nt|chrisky: i told ypu we play better they bid better...:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because @H3-3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: if this goes wrong it will be entirely East's fault|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  wow, nice stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice @c fit makes 6 @h or @c laydown ,but opponents bid so much that it was not found |pg||
nt|yusufb: derseki bilki en az 2 içeri:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h e kontr derse @s e ceza pasý geçmiþtim anlamýnda oynuyoruz biz(erenin eli)|pg||
nt|famus: great move--v interesting plan|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 down here i think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on best defence, this is heading down 800, for a deserved Italian swing|pg||
nt|bebechira: -3?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: As weel as @H from same side.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|chrisky: i think we will pass now|pg||

nt|key1809: Trump?|pg||
nt|key1809: looks safe|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume, he will go for a trump lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's hard, he would preserve his 10 @s |pg||
nt|yusufb: 6@d demiþiz |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|key1809: West is on lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ahhhhhhh ok lol|pg||
nt|eugenio123: so trump seemed so normal, @d is another way to lead|pg||
nt|key1809: that was not a good opton, |pg||
nt|rodal f: Karlson by a pzyke?|pg||
nt|timve:  only 7 trikcs|pg||

nt|chrisky: only 6-6 in minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: something like:)|pg||
nt|mamos: ansd a 17 count|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  last board until the break |pg||
nt|cicus: 8 IMPs for us!|pg||
nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: gabor, behave!|pg||
nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||
nt|yusufb: ilkdevrenin son eli|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt oynanýr|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin iyi atak yaptý ben yapmazdým @c A atagý|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he made it|pg||
nt|friggi: Sweden made some blunders missing the slam though|pg||
nt|kaapo: Oh, better news for Sweden then|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not clear to reach 4@S on that one but if South gets to hear about 3-card support he should give it a try|pg||
nt|bagman: by cashing the @DA, E prevented the nice safetyplay of @DQ (taking care of AT9x on W)|pg||
nt|zebutin: Vallivaara has quite good distribution... 6@D isnt exactly hopeless, just doesn't make|pg||
nt|goss: with a quite hard end (4 top countries to play) France aims at winning its qualification for the world championship|pg||
nt|goss: but a third place would anyway be appreciated :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: they will qualify...|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I must say that N/S Is very unlucky. |pg||
nt|stevedr: i would just call it bad def in other room|pg||
nt|veistikke:  their other partners have costed them 30 imps |pg||
nt|andreasw:  Danish match had a fun board:) who was more lucky? the ones who went 2 down in 6@d wich has 12 tricks and only lost 3 imps? or the ones who bid 7 wich was down 1 while 6 stands and gained 3 imps:)?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w po³owie rozdañ pad³y remisy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  (and that partner's possible club strength is in shorter club hand... and ... and... :))|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, was private :))|pg||
nt|ritong: np  eheh|pg||
nt|zlatan: after 2 sleepy boards time for some action|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  No comment! :P|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|zlatan: i wont be surprised if they reach 7 of a major|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Finos choses 5@s:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Dinos|pg||
nt|zlatan: after double 7@s looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||
nt|zlatan: and then 6@s|pg||
nt|eleni: he may chose a 6@d bid though promising both|pg||
nt|tez: teþekkürler herkese..ikinci yarýda görüþürüz|pg||
nt|famus: new leader--wd italy|pg||
nt|bebechira: even without Thomas Bessis...they have very good players..Thomas was the special one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Advice for South?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yusufb: 30 imp geriyiz fakat yetiþebiliriz |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW play transfers after 1-level overcall, but not after X ?|pg||
nt|cicus: no 2@S by E?|pg||
nt|eleni: there we go:)|pg||
nt|timve:  I played 2nd/4th, but this disadvantage is the reason I stopped playing it|pg||
nt|timve:  also its in more situations hard to read|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen@h@h Bonjour a Toutes et Tous@h@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt batýyo ama yaptýrýlabilir|pg||
nt|bagman: some people lead aces against slams|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT was my choice also|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciekawe jaki rebid wymyli Jassem|pg||
mb|2N|nt|timve:  Im back to good old attitude switch|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, don't speake too soon...|pg||
nt|bagman: might kill W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@C from rubino?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be pass and 3@C from Kytömaa|pg||
nt|kaapo: you think? :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@d was made?|pg||
nt|bagman: lead director with Axx|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, i have seen some weird stuff before...this wouldn't be even top 5...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even though 6@D is laydown, I think this was the correct auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just shows the value of the preempt|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was just typing ..what happened to 6d|pg||
nt|goss: yes 6@d is making but hard to reach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The way to get to 6@D is for South to re-open with 5@D, and North to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|lechcold: problem w tym, ¿e WJ nie przewiduje ¿adnego rebidu z t¹ kart¹:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I honestly think that 3NT was the better percentage choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But this is what we need :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Double would be nice though ;)|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart lead and ducked|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba wola³bym 2@C, wskazuj¹c 5+trefli i 15+PC|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I guess some of them wont sleep that good tonight :P|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
nt|andreasw:  naaah:) after playing alot of bridge you will allways sleep good:)(unless you went down in 7nt with 18 top tricks!);)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chrisky: no D no trouble|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I did once ;)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
nt|famus: bingo--trump lead best for defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: jeli 3@C by³o naturalne, to licytacja Jassema wskazuje dobry fit treflowy i obawe o kara - Tuczyñski powinien pójæ zdecydowanie do przodu|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
nt|famus: there u go|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
nt|yusufb: ernin eli 2@h pas demezdi|pg||
nt|lechcold: i tak zrobi³:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|dK|nt|famus: there wud b a final black suit squeeze and throw in perhaps|pg||
nt|famus: big swing to italy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  if it's showing @s +@c in swedish style (thanks ukdorj) then it makes more sense to me|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|hK|nt|key1809: when u have an option, it cant be the only one:)|pg||
nt|bagman: A better plan would have been to cash another heart and pitch the @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: now that would have failed as the diamonds are 4-1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andreasw:  7*slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: hi|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: it does not matter much as W's trumps could have been coup-ed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|zebutin: this works too|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :P |pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: yeh corrected not a BIG swing since -200==so translates to 6IMPs to Italy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: this actually works much better|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cicus: but that would not have gone without risk|pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: mistery:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance for France here perhaps|pg||
nt|zebutin: N/S have some cards again|pg||
nt|bagman: NS slam in hearts (or probably in clubs and NT too)|pg||
nt|bagman: NT and clubs from N|pg||
nt|bagman: hard to bid, easy to make|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mamos: not much for anyone here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i have to leave guys, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@s is 5@s and 4+minor, weak|pg||
mb|1H|nt|timve:  3@C with south or pass?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chrisky: 1 nt for ns|pg||
nt|ntmon: or 6@D for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they super raise with balanced hands|pg||
nt|lady007: 3@c is pass/correct|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: i hope it s not 2NT " almost forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: in the same time Italy, my team, is winning 42/18  |pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@c is min|pg||
nt|goss: but then you need to have discussed the auction with pd : 3S p p X p 5C p 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||
nt|ahri:  operator: did north upgrade or is it 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 3 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: though|pg||
nt|famus: 4-1 trump break again we see|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Specs. S can not bid 3@H now. Game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he upgrated to 15|pg||
nt|chrisky: or 2@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: but agree, @S fit is at hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I must say I like to play 2NT NF|pg||
nt|zlatan: typical 1nt opening after a bad board :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they managed to bid 4@S at other table too on 15, so most likely same score|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H to prawdopodobnie dwukolorówka:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|goss: here Robert is showing 5-5 with little hope for slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pinticus: Italy gains 3MPs,Madala plays 6@s+1 on 14(@d lead)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT promising 4-card support I hope :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and inv+|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
nt|goss: otherwise, he wd bid 4@d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: 4@D directly over 1NT?|pg||
nt|goss: yes french standard|pg||
nt|goss: showing 5-5 majors, game level|pg||
nt|8252: non parla l'italiano qui ? |pg||
nt|goss: si si :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think this convention is the most common in sweden after 4 NT blackwood|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
nt|bagman: if 2@S was FG, S had time to listen to a reaction from N with 3@H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The youngsters are required to play French Standard, are they?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|famus: wud go down in 5@s ass well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahri:  good switch|pg||
nt|eleni: yet pls gfollow the final scores on the sute of the Youth's European Champioship:) as they chanfe ar every board:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: a bit too shy E here|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but can he set up the spades then?|pg||
nt|juan lukas: on a @d lead, declarer has to pick up the Q@s |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|chrisky: tha mporw..|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|timve:  if he went for it yes|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe it would have worked better for east to return a low heart, so west can play another round of trumps|pg||
nt|timve:  yep|pg||
nt|ybob: S showed AQ @D now|pg||
nt|famus: i think instead of 4nt e wud've done well had he cue bid in @Cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H probably shows some extras as with a weaker hand South might jump to 4@H over 2@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tejjyid: I don;t like 4@C becasue it's hard to get back to 3NT|pg||
nt|goss: no they aren't but i quite know those ones|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eleni: Just look at the site, after the end of each round |pg||

nt|Walddk4: They have one good board each from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is good for Denmark, 20 will be good for Sweden|pg||
nt|lady007: this hand looks more interesting|pg||

nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
nt|dkkello: On running score board 14 is wrong |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  (although he was belgian)|pg||

nt|bebechira: rememeber brd 15 ... the -800?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: So East will have to open 1@H and try to tell the extras later|pg||

nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was the other one|pg||
nt|lady007: will east rebid 2@c or 2@d? and do they play some type of gazilli here?|pg||

nt|lady007: it might depend on the meaning of a direct 2@s response over 1@h|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like a board that should not affect any matches|pg||
nt|goss: @s|pg||
nt|8252: surprising french standard commands a 1@s|pg||
nt|goss: I don't understand here|pg||

nt|goss: yep|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||

nt|bebechira: thx Todor|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes or 6 :P depens how they lead|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @d everytime they get inn|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
nt|bagman: N needs to push the @SQ thru|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS in trouble in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: why?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E opens 2@d multi|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah right, some East's might venture an opening|pg||
nt|goss: 5@c showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Asks for trump queen|pg||
nt|goss: should bid 6@d now|pg||
nt|goss: to show Q of trumps and K@d|pg||
nt|rado: and 6@S easy ruffing 3@C ( precious 8@s)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Agustin in 6d in brd 16|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
nt|famus: that wud set it|pg||
nt|bebechira: after Agustin dbled the 3s preemt|pg||
nt|goss: on which auction ?|pg||
nt|goss: ok|pg||
nt|bambik: ciekawe jak sobie poradzi z rozgrywka|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @d bye |pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D there so really a trouble|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Jessi jednak ma en eggs:0|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will play @D AK and @D and play for a @S houner in place|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wasn't W free to bid 4@D at the road?. My way always.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hehe|pg||
nt|famus: -2 even if madala tries to make|pg||
nt|famus: a duck here wud have been a double dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 6NT is the slam to be in|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3s p pd-4nt-6d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eleni: depemds on the guess of Mike Sofios|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Bidding visionaries often aren;t appreciated|pg||
nt|goss: I agree with X|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eleni: S has to give up his losers early enough and guess correctly the @H|pg||
nt|baardolav: we see the transfer in action here|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bill recommended 3nt|pg||
nt|goss: I know :)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is hard ...and Delle Cave 4nt made things easy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  i dont belive on that result after a splead in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@D is down on a @S lead????|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently Fryklund didn't believe his partner has any trumps, but he had a trump trick himself|pg||
nt|bagman: now the @HQ scores and NS can take the club ruff, too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem with the double ... partner bids 4@C, and there goes 3NT which could easily be your only making game|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||
nt|goss: then hope to also make 5@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
nt|8252: double ruff brings 12 easy tricks, if W doesn't switch @s : 9 @s K @d and the 2 aces|pg||
nt|rado: that's the reason people open 3@S sometimes:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chrisky: no quess is neded|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|cicus: 1ha shows nt hand or hearts and clubs, 1sp asks, 1 nt shows balanced hand - same spec|pg||
nt|baardolav: a good game 5@d, a little bit unlucky|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for your kind help, all pectators|pg||

nt|friggi: nice bidding here|pg||
nt|galois85: so let's get back to 15-15? |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So they one good slambidding and one bad  |pg||
nt|friggi: this will bring some IMP's to Sweden:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here the bidding was natural |pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: and that was not the card it should have feen plaued:)|pg||
nt|timve:  south tries to find an 6 sixth trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|key1809: wouldnt he open 1nt with 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|eleni: now things look a lot brighter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19-11 VPs is my guess|pg||
nt|goss: here once you have made the 3 and 4 of spade, you're home|pg||
nt|bebechira: Italy is extending the lead , but unfortunately for them..Israel is only 11 imps down to Netherlands at the moment|pg||
nt|8252: correct, but on @s switch, Robert must play on his @c, with precise timing|pg||
nt|goss: all that results are not helping my country !|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|timve:  well I wont bid with east|pg||
nt|timve:  too many tricks|pg||
nt|timve:  wrong number of spades|pg||
nt|timve:  west has a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but west has an aceless hand|pg||
nt|lady007: cant really bid 5@h with that|pg||
nt|dkkello: I like Eges 3 @H , bravely done |pg||
nt|famus: since he hjad to find @Ds as he did for 3NT--a duck might have been brilliant|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kapitan Sowa na tropie|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ryskiel_: Piotrek - chleba nie jeæ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Spec saying pas from N shows weak balanced or strong any|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: que by @S|pg||
nt|ahri:  this would be interesting in 3NT, to see how E would tackle minors|pg||
nt|ritong: well done|pg||
nt|cicus: please forgive my laziness not having  searched for their conventioncard|pg||
nt|eleni: Kacper is informing me now that Miss Sakowska in S at the open table is a girl:):) we wish her all the luck:)|pg||
nt|lady007: but we've seen them bid very agressive before|pg||
nt|lady007: no, not this time|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C probably 9-11 with 3-card @H support|pg||
nt|lechcold: tego ju¿ W nie zniesie:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eugenio123: this round has been a slaughter of imp|pg||
nt|ybob: nice dummy pd said E :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h bye Nin open |pg||
nt|kaapo: Also bid by both tables|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt was 11-14*?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pinticus: oh,he discarted the wrong card,so 1iMPs for turkey|pg||
nt|friggi: sry -1|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make only 8 tricks in hearts losing 4 blacks and a diamond|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||
nt|ahri:  4 minors to cash and then it's time to let mr. Coudert guess spades|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@H -1 6@D =|pg||
nt|eleni: E-W as they are behind they are playing a catenaccio:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like Finland might be getting chunk of imps back, when Italy is playing at 4@S in deal 16|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to s¹ skutki wejæ po kilkakroæ podlimitowych|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: he had 8 tricks in the bag, trying for overtrciks, and rightly paying the price|pg||
nt|rodal f: Switch a @C    @S NS and EW have a nice major|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least on the diamond lead|pg||
nt|goss: only @c really beats it|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but surely NS have underbid, after all 5 diamonds a good contract|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: and declarer may take the @c correctly |pg||
nt|goss: :( :(|pg||
nt|goss: well done by Di Franco|pg||
nt|8252: is Difranco related to Massiliano Di Franco ?|pg||
nt|goss: his first name is Massimiliano|pg||
nt|bebechira: in brd 18 Israel bid and made 6s in the open room..in the closed a different story....W in 5d dbled...so new leader there|pg||
nt|goss: who are you refering to ?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|friggi: need also friendly lead:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, some misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|bagman: now declarer probably guesses the spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
nt|bagman: and ducks twice to set up a spade for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|veistikke:  dbl from west shows 15+|pg||
pc|d9|nt|goss: few mistakes by Italians since I arrived|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ntmon: EW with combined 15 HCP X their opps in a partscore for penalty|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: *slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: not bid in OR either|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i ma³y pik:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: did N think that E underlead the @SA ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahri:  playing @cK from doubleton didn't prove great for croats in their first match. here it was correct.|pg||
nt|kaapo: East a notorious ace-underleader perhaps...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  v|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would not have passed 2@H on N hand.. no way!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: not a bad idea to go for overtricks, but ur contract shd never b in danger all the way|pg||
nt|kaapo: Madala managed to get his partner to declare|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Out for a push.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|timve:  think vulnerable you should only bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||
nt|dkkello: So far Tofte has done everything right today |pg||
pc|h3|nt|timve:  when your pretty sure you make it vs an non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|timve:  bidding for 1 off |pg||
nt|timve:  isnt good imo|pg||
nt|lady007: well, they might not double you and then its a good save if they make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahri:  guessing time|pg||
nt|eleni: boy with all those conventions!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahri:  although i doubt he'll miss.|pg||
nt|kaapo: From East the leads were much friendlier|pg||
pc|c7|nt|friggi: sure|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chrisky: it was a asking bit for @C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lady007: but i agree, you should be very carefull bidding 5@h at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and none here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: well only 4 clubs left..|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|eleni: simple bridge=best bridge:)|pg||
nt|mamos: no great damage done here as 5@h-1 from OR but boy oh boy these Greek boys have had so  many chances here |pg||
nt|kaapo: Back in the 19 - 11 league, with Finland gaining 13|pg||
nt|bagman: If N has the @CA, he has the rest|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kaapo: Especially the dimond chosen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dkkello: around 18-12 19-11 for Denmark then |pg||
nt|bagman: so it's safe to play a club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or 20 - 10 if looking at the right column|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Can't rectify the count for the squeeze|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||

nt|Walddk4: And now the good board for Sweden. Rimstedt did well when she passed 1@H. It propelled N-S to 4@S, and 5@D can't quite make. And even better, the Swedes collected 500 when declarer ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: misguessed trumps|pg||

nt|lady007: 3N for east here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Earlier I remarked that it has been a tough day for Finland - but tougher still it is for the operators, who may have to keep focused through all 60 boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is the last board... we have to thank to Todor our vg operator...a wonderful job|pg||
nt|veistikke:  i still wonder how they got 7 tricks inn 1@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like 4 @s but can you make it -you have to be careful -@d ruff beats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He showed a cl suit here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C would be strong or long @Hs - so with clubs Mikael has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bagman: In NT the defense can grab 7 first tricks (and declarer has only 6 quick)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like this may turn out for a decent match for our team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure I care for that 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: ka¿de 11, itp|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||

nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
nt|bagman: this might make for a small gain compared to 1NT down one|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I see now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rado: tx all operator kibs and commentators:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||

nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
nt|kaapo: France up against Israel, so with a great result, Italy would've been much closer|pg||
