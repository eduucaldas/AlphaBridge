pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|007 joosth: d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: For shure no screen|pg||
nt|kemperg: anyone also 3@H instead of 4@S?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 4 club tricks and entry to cash them. He has 8 tricks ready and can set up a spade for 9th|pg||
nt|bagman: If the defense attacks diamonds, the 9th come from there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: endplayed for 9th trick|pg||
nt|007 joosth: declarer has an entry in hearts at both sides.   the long suits should be free before the opps remove the entry|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer likely to go up the @HK on the heart switch to cash the clubs and then set up the spade|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when E would play a heart now  declarer can take the trich in dummy,  cash his clubs after which a hook in spades|pg||
nt|bagman: N can discard a spade and 2 hearts on clubs and still have stopper in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|bagman: It might take some time before Kasle works out that N holds 5-4 in the majors, which is not a typical 1NT opening|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small heart is most promising for defenders.  maybe W has the ace|pg||

nt|mcsd: - 9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: diamonds was ok if W has KJ|pg||
nt|bagman: That @DT might have been the only card to beat 3NT if N had AQJxx Axxx 7x AT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: needs 2 specific cards   but the advantage is that a good guess by declarer is impossible|pg||

mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: wrongsided  and easy to mis a good slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|007 joosth: 6D with open cards,  but bad contract|pg||
