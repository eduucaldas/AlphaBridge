nt|gracelin: I bet you'll see|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure EW is playing Precision.  NS also likely Precisioners but I am not sure.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I played Precision for 20 years but it has gone out of fashion over here.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: The 1C opening was alerted, so probably NS also play Precision.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if North was tempted to rebid 1NT, to limit the hand more.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|gracelin: In China, Precision is still the dominating bidding system among top and average players.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The defenders can take five quick tricks against 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I wonder what is 2D?  an inquiry or a transfer to H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must not lead the @H10.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but the lead of H9 or H10 will take one less trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Now West must find the heart switch when she takes the @CA.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|gracelin: when West gets in with the A, not sure she will find the necessary Heart shift.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: both spade and D looks promissing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|s5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has had a chance to signal with 2nd and 3rd clubs, but 3 suits were in the reckoning.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer tried to induce West to continue spade with the spade discard.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@D did show hearts, West will read declarer for a doubleton there. |pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but I couldn't be sure what did 2D show|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT slipped through at the other table, as you see.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With 9 and 6 of clubs, East cannot want a diamond.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so even West finds the right shift, there is no prize to her.|pg||
nt|brolucius: From West's point of view, East can hold only one good card. Maybe this needs to be the @HK.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|gracelin: true.  I wouldn't blame them on failing to shift to H|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, but as Jack Zhao pointed out, declarer can play on D to take 7C, 3D and 2 Aces for 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: draw 2 rounds of trumps, DA and DQ pitching 2 spades, then one more D ruff and two spade ruff.|pg||

nt|gracelin: So Shanghai Auto is having a flying start to lead 20 imps after 4 boards.|pg||

nt|gracelin: remember, Huamen needs to win at least 20:10 VP to overtake Shanghai Auto for a berth in the top 4.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Her partner was unlimited and she had a maximum hand for a non 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, David.  North didn't do justice to her macimum non-1C opening.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: after the strong 1Copening and club fit found, West could have very serious slam interest.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West can rebid the clubs, leaving it to partner to introduce spades.|pg||
nt|gracelin: their style seems to prefer rebidding NT to limit the minimum balanced hand, rather than gicing a direct raise to 3C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 2NT limit the hand after a strong 1@C?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: not sure about their method.  I myself have way to show 19-21 hand, so 2NT is 16-18 balanced.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's useful.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NT is not the right spot on this one.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Here they will rest.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: srry, no.  East hasn't shown her good trump support yet.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: What did 4NT mean?|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually the slam is not too bad a proposition and might make after a non-H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A diamond lead will give it away.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I probably will lead HA since other choices are also ugly, not a singleton truump, not SK, and definitely not low from 6 small ones.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HA not very attractive either, with 1@C opening on your right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: West must have a distributional hand.  To lead from six baggers is too easy to allow discards |pg||
nt|brolucius: Jack and I expect a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am glad I don't have AQxx of Heart to choose from.  A432 may not lose anything wit the lead.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: you win, and WF wins with her brave raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No point in covering with the K.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is now hoping the spade finesse is wrong.  Her pray will be answered.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The high spot-card lead normally denies an honor, so North can place declarer with A-J-10, which will be worth three tricks if she covers.|pg||
nt|gracelin: a 22 imps difference with the lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On (say) a trump lead, declarer could hardly run the @DQ because the @SK might be onside. She could tempt a diamond cover, I suppose. |pg||
nt|gracelin: but here only the first discard counts.  The 2nd discard may not be as vital as the first one.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only if spades were 4-1.|pg||
