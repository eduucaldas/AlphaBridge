nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi all -- will get the names in shorttly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Larry and Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good luck Ross|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Roland and Jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: North has a typical problem, which I usually solve by just raising to 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: yes partner might have only 3 but other calls distort.  Plus raising comes in handy if partner can compete to the three level with four or five clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=BAL, 8-10|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: some would try negative double and hope to survive.  I used to do that but gave it up|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Kit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: hey kit|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play that a double (or 1@S) covers 4 or 5 spades, you can use the remaining action as take-out for the minors, but that is not standard.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ira and Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: it is becoming a more popular treatment|pg||
nt|chorush: Welcome back everyone to the thir quarter of the finlals of the Grand National Teasms|pg||
nt|joest: hi ira|pg||

nt|joest: somehow I don't think this was the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Hi Kit, Hi Larry|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|larrymori: hi Ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Al|pg||
mc|12|nt|brolucius: Since South had not promised four clubs with his opening bid, he feels entitled to compete one level higher.|pg||
nt|kit: tricky hand to play due to the diamond blockage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible via   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|joest: jack of diamonds is a nice card.  Permits this to make a slam even with losers in both majors|pg||
nt|chorush: About the quickest 11 imps I've seen in a while|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it was a super slam|pg||
nt|joest: what kind of hand would you bid 3@s on as a passed hand that would not Drury?  |pg||

nt|brolucius: Add 4 more IMPs to the Total Tricks scales.|pg||
nt|joest: teh 14-16 NT range prevented north from getting his spade suit in|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: i guess that is 15 after all|pg||
nt|joest: but just barely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It always takes a hand or two for the VGOP to warm up.|pg||
nt|kit: I think his play was the sensible one|pg||
nt|larrymori: sure but you have to take a position|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|kit: big swing on opening lead at other table|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: key was 2 of clubs lead 3/5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: After the Stayman auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3NT, you should favor a major-suit lead. Do not worry that responder holds a major; worry instead that the opener does not and will be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well-stocked in the minor suits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: the jack of hearts looks fairly normal|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson-Boyd play puppet -- this will hurt them, since West will show 4 hearts|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: now double of 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: which will warn them, so they can survive in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a chance to double.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, invite or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson considering.  Becker doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will likely shoot out 4@H, and at the unfavorable vul. Rodwell will have to sell out|pg||
nt|larrymori: cons raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod did have Intermediate 2@S available|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chorush: It would not be that one. I'd say 5-7, 4 trumps, with no singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 4 hearts is beatable but mostly double dummy, so 4S down 1 may in fact be a paying save|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: assuming North doubles, the key will be whether Robinson-Boyd have the understandings to determine they have no spade stopper|pg||
nt|joest: there are other variations of Puppet that avoid this risk but this is the 'original' version.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit, did you invent this or am I imagining things?|pg||
nt|kit: didn't invent it, but I did publicize it|pg||
nt|joest: so now the trick is to get to 5@c and keep the loss to a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson's pass denies a spade stopper -- or at least, it should|pg||
nt|joest: Your name is attached to it in my mind :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now at this point what all is forcing?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: To beat 4H, a diamond must be led without touching spades. Then the spade Q is an entry to beat the contract 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Waiting for Berk to finish the hand and I will enter the result.|pg||
mc|11|nt|kit: this redouble is just a repeat --|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was no doubt thinking of bidding 3@C on the previous round, but he can bid it now.|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like they will survive and get to 5@C|pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Here we go. Now we are live.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hi All.|pg||
nt|joest: thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: hi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chorush: this hand will test how low the Meckwellopeing bid requirement go|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting play of top @D from dummy   -   i wish i could think of that type of psychological play  before it is made at the table|pg||
nt|joest: over a 3@h opener Pettis might take action, I guess with double if you feel like you got out of bed on the right side|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler might just pass seeing if a   is available at these colors|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|joest: Gary is also a BIG fan of the 'blue card' or at least he was in his younger days|pg||
nt|joest: this is cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but removing to 5@c isn't that cheap|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: 500|pg||
nt|leo lasota: -500 is still much friendlier than 4h redbled making.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d1 now!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chorush: Meckwell can take first 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- are you a 1@S or 1N bidder over 1@H?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
nt|kit: 6 top tricks, but hard to see where  7 will come from|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save after all :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
nt|kit: I always bypass 4-card spade suit -- can get it back if partner is strong, and makes bidding much easier when partner knows I'm unbalanced for the 1@S rebid.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||
nt|kit: normal style here -- count over attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: North does not know that South hasn't the @HQ.|pg||
nt|kit: obviously North can never find the play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: always bypass when balanced, that is.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: you can keep an eye on the other table via  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Difficult for Meckstroth to find diamond shift|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't believe in being crtical of opening leads in general but I really think a trump was called for here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: and it all went as predicted -- 12 IMPs to Robinson|pg||
nt|joest: i agree|pg||
pc|h9|nt|larrymori: cash out for down 1 would be 3 imps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: especially when you have all the aces|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|leo lasota: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Rodwell pretty much has to pitch a diamond I think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: so what do I know?|pg||
nt|joest: and I'm sure in retrospect Cohler will too|pg||
nt|leo lasota: but on trump lead he can still get out d1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: I don't see much difference between a heart or a club lead. The swing was mainly due to luck.|pg||
nt|larrymori: Cole shifted to a @d in the same position to earn 200|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: yes, even in 'duplicate' there is luck|pg||
nt|kit: I see a lot of difference -- 12 IMPs difference, to be exact|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually bad luck, I have found.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||

nt|bigtrain: cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: still, seems like a bit much -- unlikely missing a game if partner can't act|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Auction started same at other table, but there West bid 5@C and was fortunate to get out for down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|joest: north south would seem destined for 3NT here|pg||
nt|kit: might not be so simple with East being 6-5|pg||
nt|kit: and West having 4-card diamond support|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: if the auction times out in such a fashion that Robinson gets to show his @Ds|pg||
nt|chorush: that;s true|pg||
nt|leo lasota: win king clubs, ruff heart, club to 9 ruff heart diamond up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low diamond lead was best dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I should know never to lead your suit."|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: Probably responsive double by Rodwell here|pg||
nt|joest: Berk might have a problem if declarer plays low but Pettis might play Cohler for KQ98 I suppose|pg||
nt|joest: still if declarer has A10 he has two tricks coming|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Meck might bid 2@H -- not sure|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: probably queen of diamonds played by Robinson at trick 1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry about that.|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like most routes lead to down 1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: upside-down signals by E-@@|pg||
nt|kit: E-W|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kit's line looks better than a club to the ace.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: a lot would depend on what west pitched on the spade jack too|pg||
nt|kit: maybe not -- East have had stiff king|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he was interested to find East with a single @CK.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|kit: Boyd leads count card back, so Robinson knows Boyd has 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: will have to finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: which may lead to down 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd should be able to work out from this line of play that declarer has bid a 3-bagger.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Declarer will simply take heart finesse and go down 1 -- noth much else left|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|kit: Still not clear how to defend -- he doesnt' know about club spots|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: This cover is not a good play I don't think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because West has a diamond entry|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson can still survive, but now it is trickier|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Not at all easy to find, but this would have been d2 if berk had led heart through and cohler plays 3rd heart after cashing last spade|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: In fact, what happens if spector cashes a club now?|pg||
nt|joest: or one round ago?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has to dump jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: yes, you're right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|joest: assuming becker could read to drop the @hk|pg||
nt|kit: or stiff his king of hearts if he is a real man|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|kit: defense needs to get that ace of clubs out of there|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|cQ|nt|kit: now the club shift -- good defense by Robinson|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chorush: Boyd is dead if Meck has A10x of clubs so I think he has to assume he doesn't have that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: so maybe he should have shifted to jack of clubs to clarify position|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson has almost played the 10 several times|pg||
nt|chorush: That would be helpful here|pg||

mb|2S|nt|kit: In closed room, North did well to rebid 2@C rather than some number of spades|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c was the call selected in the closed room here.|pg||
nt|kit: I admit it would not have been my choice|pg||
nt|chorush: about as weak as 1C gets|pg||
nt|chorush: This is a good hand for both sides to stay low on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: it is of course 'more flexible' and it works well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they'll back into the 44 @S fit|pg||
nt|kit: they are in force here, so seems like South can pass and North can bid 3@S -- must be 4 since no 2@S call last time.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: And why not. Must be better to show at least nine of your cards rather than six|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I like 2@S only.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: i like 2@s as well notwithstanding this result|pg||
nt|kit: true -- if it definitely showed clubs -- but most pairs play at least semi-forcing NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or get there right away|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I like raising my partner with any excuse, but I think that vul cohler does not have a 3d raise; he did well to just pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: When East leads one red ace, declarer will assume that he must hold the other red ace too. Not that this info is particularly useful.|pg||

nt|chorush: As it happens, EW chose the less fortunate suit to play in|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: You could be cold for 5@C, and even 6, while playing the hand in 2@S. North has a two-suited hand with spades and clubs, not a one-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|kit: Not 100% valid inference about the other ace -- East might prefer to lead ace-doubleton rather than from some broken diamond suit|pg||
nt|chorush: the hands fit splendidly and the lie|pg||

nt|chorush: It was unlikely, though not totally impossible, that 3 spades might be allowed through|pg||

nt|chorush: 2NT or ?|pg||
nt|leo lasota: It is always a shame when you have many of your values in your short suits when you are 55, but I think that Cohler still has a 2nt bid at favorable if they play that as the lowest ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 2 suits.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: Becker also passed  --  i thought Robinson would try 1@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: He can make five side-suit winners, ruff a spade in his hand and score four of the remaining five trumps.|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s obviously treated as forcing here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|nt|kit: Robinson will have to rebid 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@H is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You run the risk of never seeing dummy in 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: spade lead might be interesting, since obviously declarer can't finesse|pg||
nt|joest: east on lead|pg||
nt|kit: South hand should bid 4@H I think -- KQJ109x is called trumps|pg||
nt|kit: If 3NT were right, North likely would have bid it directly|pg||
nt|kit: now, will Boyd quit or bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will bid 3@H, though not sure he should.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chorush: It's important to have agreements here. Most, I think, play 3H as the weakest hand while pass is better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler alerted the pass.  Berk did not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oops -- and dummy is dead|pg||
nt|larrymori: tough call, misfits shud stay low|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in the other room   P-1@S//2@D-2@H//2N-3@H//P|pg||
nt|kit: AJxx an ugly suit to lead from, and gets the usual result.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so EW must play 2-way Drury|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will try to slide the 9 of hearts through -- he doesn't want it to get covered.|pg||
nt|chorush: The friendly hearts should let this one home|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks about minimum openings.  Boyd: "We aren't shy about 11 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: hands."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Interesting play problem here for cohler in 3 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: for berk that is :)|pg||
nt|chorush: The hand lies very favorably for NS but it will still be no picnic to take 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: If Meckstroth does cover, and he should, the Robinson has a problem|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: 2 of diamonds upside-down count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "A lot of junk." as he lays down dummy.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  for boyd-robinson  P-1M//   2@C=3-fit  2@D=4-fit|pg||
nt|chorush: Good play by Landenm makes life tougher for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: I don't think Robinson will be ducking any hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no reason to expect such good hearts, for a NV weak two-bid. So, he tries 3NT in the hope that South has something like @SJ-x or at least @S10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: I am really surprised about what happened in the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has the problem of being locked out of both hands.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 3NT should only be 'very wrong' when partner has mis-bid. South has just about what he has shown with regard to supporting a 3NT contract.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Becker should cash the third diamond before playing on clubs, so defense won't have a diamond exit -- but not many players think of this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Some discussion confirming that the first @d play by Boyd was USDC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kit is correct, but it will not help declarer here when West has A10xx in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: it may help for damage control|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, but the opponents will have to reconnect him for trick 8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|kit: Boyd has to be enjoying the way things have gone|pg||
nt|kit: Actually I don't think Robinson should have repeated the finesse -- Surely Meckstroth would have covered from Qxxx, and Rodwell might have ducked his queen.|pg||
nt|chorush: I agree with that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry -- lost the play.|pg||
nt|chorush: When the 8 appeared on round 2 finessing again was not indicated|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: He will also enjoy scoring up the board at the end of the set.|pg||
nt|chorush: Think declarer has to finish down 1 now|pg||
nt|leo lasota: unfortunately for berkowitz, he cannot setup a diamond discard AND take a club finesse.  However, he may work this out and ruff out diamond, play ace  club ruff club.|pg||

nt|kit: Becker knows spades are 4-2, but will he ever play West for all the honors?  I don't think so|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@H overcall in other room -- more effective|pg||
nt|joest: yes it pinpointed the sixth heart and permitted south to compete to the three level|pg||
nt|brolucius: It must be East thinking - wondering how high to go on the 'double fit'.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not without risk, as partner is passed and LHO is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The suit is not exactly solid|pg||
nt|kit: it is simply a better hand description.  Sure, once in a while it might go for a number, but sometimes it is even safer to bid at the higher level immediately.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17   [3rd seat vul and 4th seat]|pg||
nt|chorush: 40 Jacks is even particularly great in pinochle|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: isnt|pg||
nt|kit: sensible lead -- heart or club lead figures to cost more than to gain.|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Interesting decision for cohler whether to rebid 2s here.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: No, but if you say that you play weak-jumps vulnerable, you have to bid on that hand.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: It looks like the do something intelligent double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Normally with balanced hands and 5 card majors, you just pass 1nt with 9 or 10 points, hoping that partner will be able to win enough tricks on power.|pg||
nt|chorush: Personally, I would have bid 2 spades with the south hand but i am a big fan of raising on 3 with reasonable hands|pg||
nt|leo lasota: However, with a small doubleton AND Ax in another suit, I think 2S is the winning call.|pg||
nt|chorush: Brek may have lost his best chance to make this when he didnt put up the queen. Not that he should as a normal rule but the rest of the hand lies atrociously for his side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen giving this play a really good think....|pg||
nt|joest: well third hand high saves the day|pg||
nt|joest: if he plays low Berk has seven tricks right now|pg||
nt|chorush: If he plays low Berkowitz will happily take +90. If he plays the 10 I think Berk will return the 9 giving EW a chance to take 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Few pre-empts are without risk, but that doesn't stop them from being effective, of course.|pg||

nt|brolucius: The bidding was well judged around the table.|pg||
nt|kit: defense in trouble now -- club shift difficult to find, and probably too late anyway.|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|kit: Boyd will probably punt with another diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: Contract will hinge on heart guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd jumps into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will likely misguess hearts due to Boyd's original pass -- provided Boyd defends passively|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: the 3 should be suit preference for clubs |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|kit: if Robinson can conceal his AK of clubs, declarer might misjudge the strength and play him for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: then again maybe not|pg||
nt|kit: well, so much for that idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was good for a few seconds!|pg||
nt|kit: Becker knows Robinson would never be leading a heart from queen, so he should go up ace in case Boyd has stiff queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will of course also be broadcasting from the Spingold (and Wagar, women), starting on Wednesday with the Round of 32 in the Spingold|pg||
nt|kit: Admittedly difficult to construct a consistent distribution where Boyd has a stiff hearts, though|pg||

mb|p|nt|leo lasota: very nice fitting hands here for N/S.  South should make a slam try in hearts and of course North will accept with good 21.  |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|joest: well that's one way to approach it|pg||
nt|kit: This could lead to exactly the same result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson took his time before pasing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: passing|pg||
nt|kit: 5@S by Spector, for sure, and Robinson will save in 6@C|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson will now big eight clubs over 7@s|pg||
nt|joest: bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector 1st seat PASS |pg||
nt|chorush: How many clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: 4 looks right to me|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Berkowitz will use Texas and RKC|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|kit: And it might be a good save, as it was in other room|pg||
nt|joest: then again there is always that fear of pushing them into a making slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker asks about the double.|pg||
nt|joest: but yes you gotta remove this|pg||
nt|kit: Double shows extra offense and defense, but still seems clear for Robinson to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: right you were|pg||
nt|kit: And Rodwell will take a possibly good save|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Yes, he is subtracting from his partner's defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now spector with a double of his own|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see if RKCB is 4@s or 4N|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brolucius: He will claim later that it is an obvious Lightner Double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kit: Spector pretty much has to double I would think -- and can becker find a heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boyd will be disappointed to learn that he has lost IMPs.|pg||
nt|kit: Wow -- so Spector saves 5 IMPs by not doubling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny way to gain/lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector sighs and shakes his head when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|joest: cheaper to take the save in 6@h :) -- which makes on a club lead|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson has to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: Best kind of save is a make|pg||
nt|joest: two without?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kit: A lead I think is pretty obvious looking at his hand, but he thought otherwise.|pg||
nt|kit: Partner opened 1@D, he has majors bottled up -- where does declarer get tricks but trumps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set they had an even better sacrifice  6@CX making|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he could counter a trum by starting spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Only a trump lead keeps the contract from immediately being made, and I dont see that happening|pg||

pc|dA|nt|joest: well there's always the @CQ ira|pg||

nt|leo lasota: You can only wonder if berk was holding his breath when he saw the ace diamonds hit the table.  Fortunately, Cohler had him covered.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: good question!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I did -- wait a minute -- oh..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Short break at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: What I think happened is that Cohler is used to playing 4S as rkc and over that 5H would show 2 with the Q. Just a guess. Berkowitz and Cohler are not regular partners|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe you are correct Ira.|pg||

nt|joest: which I like better than the 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota: It really is not a very good holding with J9xxx, but I would probably bid 1h with landen's hand.|pg||
nt|chorush: Hand is close to being worth 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: vul  7@S is common|pg||
nt|joest: some would respond 1@s as south, playing a "Walsh" type system|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chorush: Both sides are officially now too high but Berk is going to bid 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure Jack; hearts might be dead and buried after 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: that's the risk you run for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was going to say that anything other than a 4@S rebid would be bizarre.|pg||
nt|kit: I think Boyd should double -- provided double is primarily penalties as I think it should be.|pg||
nt|larrymori: this is a big steal of vul game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  24  the other room   P-1@C-DBL-3@C//DBL-5@C-P-P//5@D-DBL-end|pg||
nt|larrymori: question of system, if X is 3 suited takeout and 4nt is 2 suited takeout he has to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: you are also endplayed after 1NT if partner bids 2C or 2S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 3@D over 2@C show this type?|pg||
nt|joest: it does if you agree so :)  I have seen folks play that fit-showing as well|pg||
nt|kit: spector considering making this not such a dull deal after all|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what 3@h was|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very thoughtful of him to consider the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|joest: but it appears Spector treated as natural|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a shot to get to 3NT if partner bids it, planning on signing off at 4@S otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Unfortunately, I cannot read the notes from here.|pg||
nt|joest: the fact that he is still thinking however is threatening to 'undull' this deal :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The Commentators' Curse strikes again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did think about 3@H as a no-trump problem, but it seems a bit risky. 4@S is the world's safest rebid.|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||
nt|brolucius: no-trump probe..|pg||
nt|kit: 4 of a previously bid major is to play.  Period.  End of story.  A very good agreement all partnerships should have.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|joest: potential double fit; favorable vulnerability.  5@d seems auto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I hope you can take a joke."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is not a hand that favors the law of total tricks.  E/W can be held to 3 hearts, N/S can be held to 3 diamonds.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That was a lot of thinking for a pass.|pg||
nt|joest: and if the club king were onside we'd be asking why he didn't bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Interestingly, the Walsh approach would have led to a bit slower auctionand NS might never have found diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, they get to 4@S. No harm in entertaining us a bit along the way.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, no swing -- but at least it wasn't dull for the specs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Landen is taking it all a bit seriously at the other table, rebidding 4@S.|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will likely shift to a trump here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Hoping declarer has 3 clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly a vlaid point, but you could keep making his hand better with the same distribution til he had to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that doesn't sound right Larry -- a) equal level conversion may apply [so 5@C-5@D]  b) DBL gets left in a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and c)  meckwell are notorious crooks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: But they are very pleasant about it at the table.|pg||

nt|larrymori: I do not know their agreements|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are unlikely to score three club tricks then.|pg||
nt|kit: right -- but he has 4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Perhaps Berk can send this hand to Larry Cohen.  N/S have 10 card fit yet they make only 9 tricks; E?W had 11 card fit yet they only take 9 tricks as well.  :)|pg||
nt|chorush: 21 trumps, 18 tricks IS unusual, but its not the worst I have seen The LAW do|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Very true Ira|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Some players lead the ace from 4, others the king. Both sets swear that their method is easily best.|pg||
nt|joest: I've never been sure when to lead the ace vs. the king in that system.  Maybe David can explain it.  He's written a book that covers it!|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chorush: Rodwell can, if he wishes, jump to 4H intheir system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24, 5@DX went down 2   i thought it had play for down 1, but still 6 imps for Spector|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR @H|pg||
nt|chorush: getting conservative as he gets older|pg||
nt|kit: he has seen his partner's minimum opening bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was supposed to show 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|chorush: most experts play 2H as a constructive raise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfc: Thumbs down on the spade raise from both sides of the screen.|pg||
nt|joest: well if that's so that is what I would bid with this hand b/c 2@s is reserved for horrible hands|pg||
nt|chorush: If NS do, the Cohler doesn't think his hand is constructive. I disagree|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Cohler has tough decision whether to show constructuve values or not; an ace and a king are very promising, but 34333 shape is not.|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect he showed nonconstructive or we would not be waiting for Berk's bid|pg||
nt|joest: well I play 2@h as constructive and believe me I would bid 2@s on so much less than this I couldn't afford to take the chance with 2@s|pg||
nt|chorush: I'm definitely with you Jack. 2S could be a 4-3-3-3 3count|pg||
nt|joest: "constructive" does not mean "limit raise"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I agree with both of you, the constructive 2h raise would be my choice as well.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: and the 2@D raise makes North's 2@H call more competitive rather than constructive|pg||
nt|chorush: no, it just means a hand that if you compete with 3 spades later you wont be finding a Yarborough|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chorush: so much so that Meck has a maximum|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will have a second chance to lead his singleton club if he misses the first time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "Might only have three."|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: But he might not know what to play for|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: well done|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: They still haven't made it, but looks like they will|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both Souths did well to raise the hearts on their moderate hand. Obviously the right move. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Provided robinson reads the lead as a singleton -- he should, since South marked with short spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't most people play 2@H as a one-round force here? If it isn't, then double|pg||
nt|kit: not clear whether to return a trump or a spade here -- probably spade, playing partner for Kx is best|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 3H was passing the buck|pg||
nt|joest: yeah well I don't like 3H for two reasons|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, sometimes it is worth considering how aggressive your partner's bidding style is.  As we see, Berkowitz still made the aggressive game try so the game is still reached.|pg||
nt|joest:  1: you are torturing partner|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest:  2: if partner gives you a slow 3@s you have an ethical night mare|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I really like reason  1 just on principle.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: I don't think most people play 2@H forcing|pg||
nt|joest: well I offered two just in case :)|pg||
nt|chorush: exactly Jack. Both very important points. IMO is 2 spades was not constructive, Cohler had the all-time quick 4 spade bid after the 3 club try|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|joest: I know I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then you have to double|pg||
nt|kit: why?|pg||
nt|kit: if partner passes 2@H I'm probably high enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H constructive, but NF|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding you may want to compete against 2@D with quite a modest hand including fair hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play the same with no interference, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- here 2@H isn't necessarily so construcive|pg||
nt|kit: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: but as I said, here 2@H isn't necessarily constructive.  With no interference, it is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many bridge teachers say 'Change of suit forcing', but I have always thought that this is because it is much easier to teach! |pg||
nt|joest: out of comp, transfer advances can enter the picture (for some pairs) that makes things a bit easier|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  [always 1st/2nd & 3rd not-vul]|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Certainly, N/S want to make sure that North declares this 3nt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: A chance for Spector to tie the match if they can bid and make game -- both of which are big ifs|pg||
nt|brolucius: South missed out on his 2@C rebid, Roland (at the other table).|pg||
nt|kit: club from his hand doesn't make a difference|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO that was already unlikely ipso facto.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Did Marc Smith not right a book on transfer advances, David, or was it just an article?|pg||

nt|chorush: Well, the law of total tricks got massacred a couple of hands ago. this time it's going to be Goren's "26 HCPs make a game"|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: so, what should South rebid here?  3 possibilities at least|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest: now 3@h/3NT I would think|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He has been asked to write a book on that subject. He writes frequently in Bridge Magazine on the theoretical side of bidding.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: Spector upgraded with the spade fit and got to the game.  Now he has to make it.|pg||
nt|joest: I think Brian SEnior devoted a chapter to it in his book "The Transfer Principle"|pg||
nt|joest: and Jeff Rubens has written about them off and on a while back in The Bridge World|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker takes a bit of a walk as dummy for the first time in this session (I think).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens wrote about them in the Bridge World, April 1981|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's excellent to bid the heart game. 3@H must have been bid on the partial spade fit. Well done.|pg||
nt|joest: wow " a while back" = 30 years.  I should have known.  :(|pg||
nt|kit: How should he play this?  Not clear at all.  Maybe just straight crossruff, which needs only queen of hearts onside or possibly a blockage|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell had to guess how many hearts and/or spades his partner had|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: 3 makes, albeit with a litle discomfort when diamonds do not come home for 5 tricks, from the North side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it appears he guessed wrong as both 2@H and 2@S probably down 1 -- but surely percentage action.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And it looks like the blockage works|pg||
nt|chorush: no, the did very well to right-side this although they had no way of knowing what the right side was|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|leo lasota: Ax opp Qx "right side" is completely dependent on the holding of the opponent's cards.  Given that, it is still right in the long run to have the hand with Kx in spades playing the ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hand.|pg||
nt|chorush: not auto to duck here|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|joest: could lose to the king and get a spade through when both minors were running all along|pg||
nt|joest: good point|pg||
nt|chorush: this is where you love to have 0 or 2 opening leaders|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens actually wrote about them in a 6-issue series in 1980-81. It was reprinted as a single monograph. You can buy it from The Bridge World|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector maybe thought that East would not play the @DQ unless he also held the @DA.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: Cohler in 3N N   Berkowitz bid 3@C instead of 2@D  but rest of auction the same|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he leads a @H, not so clear whether declarer should duck|pg||
nt|kit: I guess I decided Meck might not double with Qxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: ten is Rusinow (top card if 3 or less hearts)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is rusinow that may or maynot have higher honor|pg||
nt|kit: Good point Warren, but I think it is percentage play|pg||
nt|kit: since going up is right only if diamonds right, both majors wrong, and West finds spade shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Landen's lead was @HJ  so effectively same info for both declarer's|pg||
nt|kit: at other table declarer did go up ace of hearts, so will be in jeopardy|pg||

nt|joest: well that was exciting!|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO that was a "tired" play|pg||
nt|leo lasota: it is important to have solid agreements with your partner there.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: It has been an interesting set so far, although I am sorry to tell David that we may get a 1NT contract here|pg||
nt|kit: a case could be made for a 2@S raise, or even a 2@C rebid, as well as 2@H and 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen seems a bit annoyed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Spector: 'Let me play them in future, will you?'|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room east ventured a brave 2@h call here|pg||
nt|joest: but Jeff Meckstroth has never been timid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Time to put on some tea, David.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 1NT might be pretty interesting I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David will be back in 10 minutes after he has had his shower. He always takes a shower when we display 1NT contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Your least favourite place to play.|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is obviously 100% forcing|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Miles too late for tea, Ross. We are well and truly into the alcohol zone.|pg||
nt|kit: Rusinow leads and ace from AK vs. NT -- king would be power lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|joest: so it looks like king is the 'power lead' (i.e. unblock partner) which forces pairs to lead the queen from holdings like this (assuming one is going to lead an honor)|pg||
nt|joest: too fast kit|pg||
nt|kit: 6 is upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact I will go downstairs and put the remaining half of yesterday's bottle into the ice box. brb.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell hoping his partner has a 2@S call instead of a 3@C call.  His prayers weren't answered.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N would show 2-places-to-play, so maybe that translates to 3@C = 5+|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: Robinson can deduce declarer doesn't have A10x, or he would not have ducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He puts cognac in the refrigerator?|pg||
nt|kit: And partner can't have Axx and play the 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Roland, the British have some strange notions.|pg||
nt|kit: So it was safe for him to continue with king of hearts -- he failed to work that out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I have noticed, Ross|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: Many options for pettis to consider on this hand.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i'm told prayers are always answered -- but usually the answer is NO|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can continue diamonds and get a ruff with his 4 of clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: And the diamond shift gave declarer  7|pg||
nt|chorush: He will be doing well to make this, after he finds 4 spades in South he is likely to play North for diamond length|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler did well to stay off the diamond lead -- with only one trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|brolucius: I heard that. It is the rest of the world that is strange. |pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should -- reason Robinson didn't lead heart was likely to be that he had the ace.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Yes, Cohler has hidden from pettis the nature of his distribution.  Unlikely that Pettis expects North to be 1714.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: no bidding; no singleton lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: I think Pettis will need mirrors to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There are mirrors in the room, but they are too high to see any other hand. :)|pg||
nt|chorush: play could also have been fascinating had Cohler led his diamond, After taking a ruff with the spade 9, he could not return a heart because that would give the trump show away|pg||

nt|chorush: Rodwell going to defend this one quickly. Take first 3|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club, two shakes on the top diamonds and down one|pg||
nt|joest: two rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|chorush: He might be considering whether and how he could handle a stiff quack in north|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis still trying to imagine a miracle layout where he may make.  He may ruff club, cash AK diamonds, then play ace and king hearts hoping for QJ tight in the North hand.|pg||
nt|joest: yes. in fairness he is not giving up on making this|pg||
nt|joest: and if he plays a heart up, Cohler will split just to be sure and play will slow down further :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: If South holds honor fourth in trumps and north has the stiff jack or queen, the hand cannot be made if we agree that spades are 42, with south having no more left.|pg||
nt|joest: and Meckwell has matched the contract again|pg||
nt|chorush: for a stiff quack based on what he has seen, North would be 4-1-3-5|pg||

nt|chorush: Could Boyd have thought his pass was forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Surprise!  Meckwell reached 4@s in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think most players would raise the spades on that. Except strict followers of the Ron Klinger Losing Trick Count.|pg||
nt|kit: my rule is:  no aces + no kings + no singletons + no voids = no bid|pg||
nt|joest: = no fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held a doubleton club, the game would be OK.|pg||
nt|joest: defense would have to seriously awry to let this in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even without it hearts could come in for four tricks|pg||
nt|joest: south would need Kx or Kxx of hearts + trumps breaking|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Disaster here for E/W.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @SJ = 4th best  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Goren said you were supposed to lead 4th from longest & strongest, right?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: well, if he had overcalled one heart he probably would be defending 3NT in the manner Leo described|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead trumps against doubled partials, except when dummy has just 1 trump :)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure -100 will be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: this is the 'standard' lead off this auction|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Suppose you pass and West re-opens with a double. You might be worried bidding just 2@S then, with 6 points (albeit ropey ones) and 3-card support.  I prefer to bid straight away ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with a weak hand and then fold up my cards (ahem).|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: after no club lead, declarer has a real chance.  He plays on hearts, and what does North do?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he showed his hand and right or wrong it seems like Robinson has to double or bid 5@s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: There is no right or wrong answer to the question of whether Boyd's pass is forcing.  The important thing is for partnerships to have firm and unambiguous rules, and follow them.|pg||
nt|joest: now there can be some serious damage|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 300 if they take ruffs|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler coudl be afraid he is dealing partner ruffs withnatural trump tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: 3NT would likely have had a better chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with @DJ onside|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift allows this to make|pg||
nt|kit: so does ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: either a passive heart or underleading the diamond needed|pg||
nt|joest: definitely not easy|pg||
nt|kit: heart exit is okay I think|pg||
nt|kit: and of course low diamond is most successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK certainly looks attractive, though. He will do well to avoid it.|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room south got a diamond raise in (from where?) but here no bidding from south|pg||
nt|kit: Becker would have been better off leading king of clubs on opening lead this time -- of course, on a different day that could cost the contract|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|kit: would you know for sure in your partnerships if the pass is forcing?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|kit: and the swing goes back to Robinson|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I am not surprised by that. The winning defenses were very hard to find and just happened to work, I would say.|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson with only three swings in favor: but all whoppers|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chorush: Assuming they play unusual v unusal, boyd had a way to show limit or better with spades. Most likely, taking that rougte and bidding 4 spades would be forcing|pg||
nt|joest: of course Pettis isconvinced AJxx of hearts at his right|pg||
nt|chorush: That is a mistaken point of view. No one compelled partner to shift toa diamond if he didnt want to ruff|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis has 5 tricks here if he takes them.|pg||
nt|joest: a point Mr. Berkowitz might make in the post mortem :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: since he knows that south is likely short in diamonds and north is short in clubs, he should cash KQ hearts.  He will be pleasantly surprised for d2.|pg||
nt|joest: next door n-s on track to make 3NT so n-s need a   here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|chorush: or at least, that may be what Robinson thinks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|larrymori: start with he bid it to make so I do not think pass is an option|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|kit: obviously that is what he thought -- but you can't "think" here -- you must know for sure.|pg||

nt|leo lasota: oh no|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|c6|pg||

nt|kit: yes -- 3 double figure swings vs. 0, and match still very close|pg||
nt|chorush: If your partnership has a rule that there are no preempts over preempts, then maybe 4 spades should do the trick|pg||
nt|kit: there must be strict rules which cover this auction (and others)|pg||
nt|joest: yes they did have 800 coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There will be some post-mortems on that one -- on both sides, I think.|pg||
nt|chorush: Incidentally, are their more 1H overcallers than doublers here?|pg||
nt|joest: a very close and exciting match all the way so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, 17+ bal|pg||
nt|kit: that is my rule -- 4@S not a preempt over a preempt, therefore bid to make voluntarily, therefore in force.  But I'm not guessing.  |pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 1@h i confess|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: As we were all saying.... an excellent raise by East on the first round!|pg||
nt|chorush: I would also|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another discussion to be made with all partnerships is if you play equal level conversion doubles with 4 spades and 5 hearts.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 2N=game force 4441@C/@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: thats me too|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: Lucky slam here -- they won't get there after this start I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Meck will be more interested if partner has stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does ASK|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: What does 6+4+2 come to?|pg||
nt|kit: Should Becker open 1@S or 2@C?  Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|joest: partner could have spade queen, diamond queen, heart ace|pg||
nt|joest: but those values are hard to locate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4441@D|pg||
nt|kit: do they play rkc relay here?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess not needed -- Meckstroth can just set trumps with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL changes things -- but I bet it gives Meck MORE room|pg||
nt|joest: landen surprised tohear hearts bid at his left for sure|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: i don't think Becker is passing|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he might move now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open 1@S. It gets too messy after 2@C with 6-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL, i think after 3@D   4@C=RKC @H  4@D=RKC @S|pg||
nt|kit: Even with king of diamonds wasted Meckstroth can still picture possible perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he bid 3@H?  There clearly can be no value to playing 4-4 fit opposite the 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|chorush: Picturing perfectos can be an expensive experience. Hamman says "If you need the perfect hand, I don't have it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@H is a RELAY [not setting trump]   with DBL, we need Walter|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps to set up a RKC for hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod writing a lot of explanation to Robinson.|pg||
nt|joest: now Cohler would like to bid 2@c natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at some point, Rod describes strength of hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: extremely unfriendly hand to declare for either side.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: notwithstanding the breaks, you can get a lot of mileage in 2@c north-south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Thanks....I think."|pg||
nt|joest: where does he start? :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I have no clue. the only thing he probably likes about Coh;er's hand is the spade 9|pg||
nt|joest: and if he works diamonds, the jack will be an ominous sign|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|kit: So he will bid the slam|pg||
nt|joest: yes they are still mid auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: but if he asks about the trump queen, they might still hang short|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double surely means that West has the @DA and South has the @HA.|pg||
nt|kit: but partner might have xxxx of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HA is not such a good card, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: the double surely means only 1 diamond loser|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|joest: he may duck this|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chorush: club 8 will eventually score|pg||
nt|leo lasota: queen clubs out of hand trick 2 would be my choice.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Becker thinks: '2-2 break at worst'.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: and it would be berk's choice as well. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: You are in good company. :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: yeah.  + partner might table Jxx or spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: So many IMPs riding on the lie of the cards. |pg||
nt|kit: good perecentage bid by Becker.  Unlucky about the double of 5@D.  Without that, I think Becker would have asked for queen of trumps and stopped.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what Rod said with DBL -- but they did nice job of stopping at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod: "trying to show some extras."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "This won't take long."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: landen has high hopes that his partner holds Jx in diamonds.  Unfortunately for him, berk has the second diamond, not pettis.|pg||
nt|chorush: this feels like if they offered Berk down 2 he would accept it|pg||
nt|joest: i know i would|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chorush: Yes. It was very helpful for Meckstroth to know that Rodwell was specifically 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Amazing." -- when he sees the @c split.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: they bid 6@s in the other room as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D doubled at the other table too...|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least it is fair if both teams bid (or do not bid) such a slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker shows his hand:  "Do the spades break?"|pg||
nt|kit: Note the clear victory for playing 0314 as opposed to 1430 :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: It surprises me that Becker did not ask for @SQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chorush: this is a hand where whoever is on lead wishes he were not|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|joest: so this looks to start 1@d-1NT-2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: now that surprises me|pg||
nt|joest: pass risks a double part score swing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chorush: well he does have a stiff where partner opened but I hate to sell|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would not bid 2h at unfav with singleton in partner's openiong suit.  Very lucky that partner happens to have K10x of hearts this time, but there are many other holdings where you ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: may go for a big number.|pg||
nt|joest: your hand can get sealed off in 1NT and add five tricks or so to the pot in 2@h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: yeah well life is a risk |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C  as before   2@D=bal 8-10, no 5+ suit  3N=signoff|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Steve doesn't see it my way :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: We will be back after a short break, perhaps 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks.  I've had a great time.|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead would be quite successful here -- should South overcall 2@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We should not let the last hand go without noting that a double of a Blackwood 5@D response on the @DA is not necessarily a wise move. You can see how it helped North here, at both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tables. It is different when you double a cue-bid with a high card sitting over the cue-bidder's high card.|pg||
nt|joest: a spade lead gives this a rough ride|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like routine 3NT headed down 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not -- Robinson has 109 of spades, so he will be under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: After a heart lead this is no gimme|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: Robinson not only has the 109 of spades but also the only diamond guard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: So heart lead, win, lose club hook, continue hearts, win, run clubs.  Robinson pitches 1 diamond, and then what?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: or even a heart lead and spade shift.  But difficult to fault club lead when hitting partner with just ace of clubs can be instant set.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true, but if the likely gain from bidding may be a double partial swing, while the downside is a potential telephone number, pass seems right.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|kit: Declarer will still have to sweat North having ace of hearts since the spades will block, but all is well.|pg||
nt|joest: other room: heart lead + spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: that is unweighted for frequency|pg||
