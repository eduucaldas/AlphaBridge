nt|key1809: hi Momchil|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|key1809: 2@D looks like multi here|pg||
nt|andyv:  the multi will stifle E|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  and S may try to invite in @h|pg||
nt|pelu: good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  so much for stiffling|pg||
mb|p!|nt|key1809: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Peter|pg||
nt|key1809: Pass from South shows @D's |pg||
nt|andyv:  the only thing to say about the E dbl is that it might work|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Morning Peter|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N should be xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|key1809: But now west faces a problem of bids, and he rightly chooses 2nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bilde did not take it as natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  now what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebensohl rather|pg||
nt|key1809: im not sure he intended that 2NT as Leb|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as 2@D is a weak 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make sure you have an agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: he did not alert it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is Leb on after Multi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't think he did either but from previous mach that is how they played it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I dont play 2Nt here as Lebensohl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should Leb be on after Multi? Any views?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  sure, why not?|pg||
nt|key1809: its a matter of agreement, i prefer to play it as Natural only after Multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, you might prefer to have the opps show their hand for leb to be on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting issue|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: depends on when double is bid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as I said, make sure you have an agreement. Anything can work|pg||
nt|key1809: Leb will be on after Multi , only when the weak 2 is clarified with the suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West has a hand where he would like to find out about East's hand rather than showing his|pg||

nt|eleni: last:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|riccho:  we all made revokes. THe difference is in handling the situation afterwards|pg||

nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 620/650 is on, so 500 is OK|pg||

nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||
pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  Zimmermann will be surprised dummy has everything|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  guess so|pg||
nt|smirny: is it better to lead 2nd/4th in trumps|pg||
nt|smirny: ?|pg||
nt|smirny: i think it doesnt matter|pg||

nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||

nt|panja: now. E will not lead @H..|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect slam missing, in my opinion North was too passive|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2 @c looked very much like an under bit --if you have about 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: lots of South hands make a slam near 100%|pg||
nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||
nt|eleni: let us jope Megherita will keep the bidding low|pg||
nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||

mb|3C|nt|key1809: but yes, wd be very tough to bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you are off two keycards for hearts so 6@H you can't bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: and 7 @c is a good sacrifice (going 3 down only)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob playing 4@H, but a slam "only" need @hK onside - here they are missing 2 keycards, so no slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|key1809: no way to ask key cards here, so might push them to slam here|pg||
nt|pfbr: morning Roland @h :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: but now I doubt they can realize how many keycards are they missing|pg||
nt|pelu: ok so mutch for science|pg||
nt|key1809: From North's point of view, all he needs is AKxxxx to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  did S's pass convey any info?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: he is not willing to explain|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Keyzad, 6@H is a fair shot after a vulnerable weak 2|pg||
nt|key1809: undiscussed teritor, but is Pass from North her Forcing?|pg||
nt|pelu: give S KJ10 + @DK and N will look silly if he bid slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't think so|pg||
nt|key1809: if he can pass n pull pd's X, |pg||
nt|andyv:  2N isn't forcing to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: pass is nothing special S said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True Peter, but if that is the case you can hope that EW 'save'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it is with the odds to blast it|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  that's hard to believe...it seems as if pass should show minimum with @hs...but maybe EW need to know what dbl would be|pg||

nt|vugraphzjm: in a very special manner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see what you mean|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA and another|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then underlead @CA|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice parlay for the defense|pg||
nt|key1809: going up with the Ace, and @H A n back ,would lead to the downfall|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'll take the 5-1 odds on it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: declarer playing only 5 can play A and another trump and now @C Jack is an entry for ruffing|pg||

nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||
nt|spenny80: but after 3 round in @s north MUST play @d |pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Desi @H|pg||
nt|desinka: may 2@D vs prec club is narural|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to start the clubs early|pg||
nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2nt usually means minors, looks like not for EW|pg||

nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|blum1956: The only chance for the defense was a trump switch in the second trick|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: Ege cashes the @d to get a signal from Tofte. But the signal was crossed up|pg||
nt|poohbear: wont matter though|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer prob takes the @h ace then crosses to dummy to try and pitch the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be quite a defense if North had Kxx in @h :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: at least against me :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry . I thought 9 card fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will just take @h finesse |pg||

nt|chrisky: in 3nt|pg||
nt|panja: S must have thought it was feature...so @H suit was likely to be open|pg||

nt|galois85: dbl I think shows 4 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is 500 -so good in case 4 @h makes,but there is a lot of play there|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: on board 10|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sunsamvar: 5@d MAKING|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and in practice 4@H too|pg||
nt|snetram: 1@S - transfer na BA ( lub trefle)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: a safe 4@s contract for E-W|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 4@S on 2 of three things: spade break and 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit new here. 2/1 by bought pairs?|pg||
nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: You mean in open room:):) right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep, sorry.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: as East may not lead or switch to @C in time|pg||

nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||

nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt will not make...|pg||

nt|desinka: not easy to get sigle K@C if u pkay 6@c|pg||
nt|desinka: play|pg||
nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  modern approach is to bid 1NT even with subminimum hands. Goal is to silence the bidding for NS. |pg||
nt|riccho:  In this hand however it led only to an unsuccessful contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: previous board was a disaster for Italy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||
nt|eleni: and of course if @s are not Jxxx in N's hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|spenny80: for me 2@c is a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|panja: 2@C would have been better...but then, EW might have found their 2@H spot...|pg||

pc|s6|nt|raghavan: Oh must be careful|pg||
nt|blum1956: not a bad contract after all - near down one|pg||
nt|rensph: trumps breaking 4-1 means declarer isn't home yet|pg||
nt|rensph: other room has reached the same contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: brb|pg||
nt|rodal f: The polich club|pg||
nt|spenny80: but likely the final contract is ok for italy|pg||
nt|arigun: 3nt sorunsuzdu|pg||

nt|bagman: On this lead, declarer cannot afford to duck a spade|pg||
nt|atalok: cavabçýda 16-17 puan olan ellerde þlem oynamýyacaksak bence 3nt demek genelde kazandýr.Takým maþlarýnda özellikle|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|famus: to b honest --50% slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wd |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42:  nicely bid|pg||
nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||
nt|runnerup: @c lead is orderd in these secvenses..but didnt came|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|frankbo: han underspillte rett farge|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Gerben42:  and there is the point that we dont know if N has successfully hidden his @S spots|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rensph: can now give S a @D ruff but that will give declarer more control over the trumps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: N a bit lucky|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: in general, if you have a bad long suit, better to play in the suit..|pg||
nt|panja: but with a good long minor....Nt might be a good idea|pg||
nt|frankbo: joda|pg||
pc|hT|nt|raghavan: yes hasan you said 50% - Spade K can be under SA and so makes|pg||
nt|rensph: @H ruff I mean|pg||
nt|rensph: spade now?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||
nt|riccho:  In defense most of the time the problem is to decide whether you play an acitve or a passive defense. Here N chose the active one and would have better chosen the passive line|pg||
nt|arigun: onun icin suleyman'a katiliyorum|pg||

pc|s3|nt|chrisky: -3|pg||
nt|eleni: only it wasn't a "good" long minor:)|pg||
nt|panja: y...that is why 1Nt was a big risk|pg||

nt|riccho:  yepp|pg||

nt|famus: @h slam coming up for the Hungarian girls|pg||
nt|panja: S has a good long minor this time|pg||

mb|4H|nt|famus: 3@h|pg||
nt|raghavan: Again you see here a slam in Hearts possibly bid by NS |pg||
nt|andy_h: Well it had been a pretty low scoring match until the slam board, but it's only half way so there's still plenty of chances for Germany to come back|pg||
nt|runnerup: a game -no slam -should be avoided -here|pg||
nt|rensph: 2@S in EW fails on a number of ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  I dont like the 2@h bid. shape misdescription is generally not a good idea in hands with slam potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had E bid 2@D and then @H, it was possible. Lets see.|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet hollandalýlar genelde transfer oynuyorlar acýþtan sonra|pg||

nt|eleni: den xero poios apo tous 2 milaei agglika|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||
nt|athene: aces and shape always beat a bunch of kings and queens and jacks|pg||

nt|spenny80: do you open with north cards? me not|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, you are right =) I'd better take my coffee before! lol |pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess Ege didnt want to dbl 4@d in case that encouraged his partner to save|pg||

nt|poohbear: need to have firm agreements in that spot|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak widaæ nie mog¹|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|desinka: so..]|pg||
nt|desinka: lets see the lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: We're about to see what gadgets they have in store|pg||

nt|riccho:  filigrane|pg||
nt|loe48: ta i bordet og spill ruter|pg||
pc|c3|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree.|pg||
nt|eleni: right Richard|pg||
nt|riccho:  Its sheer luck that 7@s is not an obvious contract |pg||
nt|loe48: der er ingen valg|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is a kibitzer's make; I don't know how it would go in practice|pg||
nt|bagman: In hearts NS might lose a 4th trick one way or another|pg||
nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||
nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|gmarco24: pardon me - 4@h is ok, but 5@c passed is excellent save  :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: major and club switch best |pg||
nt|vasmar: she can finesse @DJ and reach hand later by spade|pg||

nt|desinka: but it is not easy |pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR also.E bid 2@D and then @H but @S the contract.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@s is a terribly contract and would have failed if the @s are not playable for zero loser. |pg||
nt|riccho:  swo its a 5 or 7 Hand in @s|pg||
nt|riccho:  so...|pg||
nt|atalok: cl atagýna veya dönüþüne batabilir|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: N must simply cash his 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double on the strength of the singleton diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S 3/3, lucky contract.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||
nt|bagman: Makes life easier in 3@H but would have killed 4@H|pg||

nt|ady: now making|pg||

nt|rensph: yes, perhaps N should've ducked but partner didn't go for a club ruff so singleton could seem unlikely|pg||
mb|2H|nt|smirny: well with xxx in @S and stiff @D i think i would bid 4S too; IF  2@C have already been GF|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think the other table is going off in 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think sudden jump to 4@S denies control in @H and @D|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, I guess 4@s!-2 is a good defense...|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||

nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
nt|yusufb: celik 2nt demesi lazýmdý|pg||
nt|loe48: i aapent?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||

nt|sharkey: a mundane 4@H....|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room 5@d were set by -1|pg||
nt|eleni: underbid by N-S so this must cost domr imps|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair it was hard for NS because they didn't really know how strong declarer was|pg||
nt|athene: so they don't know if they are trying to beat 1nt or just restrict overtricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: so is it right to bid 3nt= 100% -but no overtricks anytime or 4@s -makes some 90 % -even+1 many cases -just think about it -i dont know..-but it is difficult to bid 3nt so nothing ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: to think here |pg||
nt|eleni: good defense by the Italian girls|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@d|pg||
nt|antoniz: widzê prezenty,oby wiecej|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: indeed.|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes. But I dont understand the trump lead in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: except for the revoke part, they have played well. May that was an eye opener.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 7@D maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
nt|loe48: den skal vel meldes ut eller?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
nt|vasmar: this can be a crucial board|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult bidding though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@d seems cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: and 7 if you ruff 2 clubs or make 3@S tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: 8 med single kloever og makke tigget|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
nt|eleni: oooooooooooops a passive bid|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think 4NT by N should be more accurate|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Flavia keepos it on|pg||
nt|chrisky: if u ruff 2 @C no need 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT is nice|pg||
nt|snetram: Po trzeciorêcznym otwarciu 1@H, kontrowanie 4@S z rêk¹ N to brak instynktu samozachowawczego.|pg||
mb|d|nt|famus: @s-@h-@d shud b the order|pg||
nt|roussol: ducking 2ice|pg||
nt|chrisky: -1 is ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not suit N to well|pg||
nt|runnerup: seaching for slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: wint pass 5D ???|pg||
nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: N never decribed her 17 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
nt|frankbo: blir ikke mange beit her|pg||
pc|s4|nt|atalok: hala olmuyor ama oynayýp batmak normal|pg||
nt|loe48: det skal trump ut er grunnregelen..og det kom det|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror H hadde vært bedre denne gangen|pg||
nt|loe48: ja her skjedde det jeg nevnte tidligere om aggressiv melding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH???|pg||
nt|runnerup: now -do west have a @s cont..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he can't he would've bid 4nt instead of 5@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gmarco24: and i ma sleeping  :) thought it's natural sequence  :D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: sry all|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told 2@C is 15+ with clubs, polish club sequence|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet bunu oynayýp batmak normali|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roussol: well done|pg||
nt|desinka: @D lead I guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4 top tricks for denmark|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|spenny80: after sgl @c in north and sgl @d in south, @h lead is possible now|pg||
nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||
nt|spenny80: good 4@h in closed room, after 1@d open better minor (easier now)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gmarco24: how would you bid as natural William?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|galois85: but  1nt... difficult singl in spades...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eleni: yes 12 are a lay down, inspirational L and J@h play gives the overtrick:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bagman: A good lead|pg||
nt|eleni: That was a safe lead by S|pg||
nt|bagman: (much better than @HA)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he would if @SA would also be in N|pg||
nt|rensph: can play 3 rounds of clubs to avoid the @S guess|pg||
nt|snetram: Brak otwarcia 1@H na trzeciej rêce troszkê zaskakuje. Jestem fanem aktywnoci, ale rozumiem styl pasywny.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|spenny80: good and likely lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Nice nose it seems:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|famus: moment of truth|pg||
nt|vasmar: smae contract in closed room|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roussol: no swing|pg||
nt|gmarco24: can go this way, isn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: well i would open 1nt with north|pg||
nt|frankbo: der kom egget|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|famus: good|pg||
nt|vasmar: so there are still some hopes if the last 3 boards permit swings|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|poohbear: declarer will strip the hand and hope for a singleton @h honor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rensph: if the first spade trick went @Sx small @SK @SA, declarer would have to guess the position of the @SJ later.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|arigun: taner yerden @sQ cevirerek iyi baslamisti devamini getiremedi|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: 1N 2@H 2@S 3N pass :)|pg||

nt|galois85: no finesses now... |pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wonder what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|galois85: yes, he has the exact count of the hands... so spades discarding clubs, ace of club, ruff one club, one diamond, again one clubs king of hearts, and diamond...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roussol: my blood pressure is :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Bravo East (also for avoiding disastrous 5@c)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: With @C behind it became a auto|pg||
nt|runnerup: who says a sacrifise sorry -makes :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did South in fact play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: sure|pg||

nt|roussol: 21|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S over 2nt then EW might be trying to get a decent penalty out of 6@SX|pg||

nt|chmitty: the save in 6@s would have cost what ? 800 ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: Over 1@C openers that are less than 4 cards about 20 to 30% of the time, the need for a club stopper is regarded by some (not me) as a quaint and archaic concept.   |pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||
nt|chmitty: anyhow last hand now :) tx all and see you in a little more than 1 hour for the last match of the day @h:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I was thinking how to go down|pg||
nt|galois85: but luckily for declearer it was the same...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Very strange - if the declarer has @d J10x raising with the Ace still guarantees two diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|rensph: south had shown 9 already... could he have held 11=|pg||
nt|ady: thx Rens   kibs and all|pg||

nt|antoniz: bardzo pechowe rozdanie 19|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Peter Gill and William Frisby|pg||
nt|famus: and 2@s if bid will make for another 5/6 imps|pg||
nt|spenny80: yess see you all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: ty Fabio and Frank|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||

nt|bagman: Thank you all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about a hour|pg||
nt|runnerup: this may end in 5 @d -and makes without @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
nt|galois85: yes, but thanks to KF and AQ it seems an impossible leading... |pg||
nt|galois85: 2nt shows 6@h and 4 in another (minor?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||

nt|chrisky: very good lead..|pg||
nt|blum1956: some accuracy needed in declaring this|pg||
