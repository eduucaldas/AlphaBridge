nt|vugrapha4: Cool I'll let her know you're watching|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Deal 1 now starting - players sorting cards....|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Not an opening of beauty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Balanced 11 counts should not be opened in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: we start with a partscore no blood here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a mini NT of course, say 10-12|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: what happened with the score of the first session?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just as well that N-S do not; that would have been costly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A Smolen sequence for E-W|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cascade: well Smolen for west but not east :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hello Uans|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hans|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Mundeel thought the other way round I suspect|pg||
nt|cascade: luckily everything behaves and 3NT will survive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||
nt|haans: most would bid only 2@H |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cascade: 4@H looks a slightly better contract to me|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|haans: bad 10 pointer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cascade: the advantage of Smolen is that the strong NT hand gets to play the 5=3 fit if it exists (and you bid it)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: The upside of the Smolen convention is that you will always make the stronger hand declare the contract, provided that they both remember the convention|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|haans: if you do not pass 4@S you find many slams that will not make|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mamos: 5@S  is always a horrid thing to play -- no gain but lots of strain :)|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mamos: so what options does declare have now ?  always important to concentrate on your target he must try for safest way to 11 tricks not worry about 12|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Yes, I would probably lead a trump too as I know they have (should have) at least nine trumps between them. My second choice would be a heart|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||

nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||

nt|haans: and now action|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a misfit|pg||
nt|mamos: misfitting hands  -- can NS stay out of trouble?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now they hit my birtday, 9-25|pg||
nt|Walddk2: birthday even|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  EW will have to stay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mamos: South knows the danger |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I bid, I prefer 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: 3NT a chance|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt a bit more appealing than 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  quite an overbid but perhaps driven there by the vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South needed to bid 3NT  |pg||
nt|ianmcc: might as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: 5 minutes remaining|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  with a 7 loser hand, W should just dbl|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: well never easy|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S opening next door. Declarer was lucky, no-one had a double|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cascade: 4@s in the other room was very successful|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: 5@c was a better prospect|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: How to make only one heart trick on defence|pg||
nt|cascade: even with a double she wins as the normal lead results in -600 here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: 3NT had some chances and 5@c more than 5@d  I think that they would all fail but 5@d  never making I fear|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should go down 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: go for kill direct|pg||
nt|haans: allways best :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: sounds like the TD ought to be at Cape Canaveral just before a launch |pg||
nt|bebechira: last board thx Mike super job... and Leigh ,,what can we say...he was a star|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|bebechira: Leigh is the captain of the NSW youth team... :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: can EW get to 3NT by East|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso.... and he is very strict with the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe 3@H-3NT?|pg||
mb|3H|an|stopper ask|nt|vugrapha2: you guessed it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: we had 80 mins for the session ..it seems 90 would have been more generous|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: this may wrong-side it|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: on a spade lead, tnat is|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I fancy North might lead a heart in preference anyway|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: gives EW a chance to right-side it....redouble, 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: another 10 for NSW on 9|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: well there goes all of that discussion...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: danger: auction out of control|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 5@DX should go for 800|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: looks like on 9 my wimpy 3@s would not have worked :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I guess South can be significantly weaker for a Michaels cuebid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: indeed, but she doubled 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: very true|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: you need to do a lot of work about what bids in the oppo's suit mean in these kinds of auctions|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one playable method is that bids like 3@h show stoppers - so 3NT is reasonable from Eats|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and also, if a bid is doubled, what redouble means - again, a playable methid is that redouble shows a partial stopper (eg Jx here) - which makes 3NT by East even clearer     |pg||
pc|dK|mc|8|nt|vugrapha2: Thanks guys. Back here in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, thanks all - see you again shortly|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set. Many thanks to Cathy, excellent operating. |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no worries, sorry i got lost on a few hands..|pg||

nt|Walddk2: also thanks to Wayne and Bill for commentary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short break|pg||

nt|haans: best west declaring|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S loves to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well ?|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not volunteer 3@S, but I don't think I will ever be selected for the WA women's team|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  3@c probably a xfer|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cascade: looks like a save against a likely 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d only goes for 1100|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would pass as S now|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|ianmcc: claim|pg||
nt|mamos: the match is close with only thre boards or so to play in each room  -- but 5-6 comparisons|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  ok, we can assume the EW got to 6@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  operator, need to undo auction all the way back to 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW will be plus 1460|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what about set 1?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
