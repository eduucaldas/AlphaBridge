nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi all -- will get the names in shorttly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Larry and Jack|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Good luck Ross|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Roland and Jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|joest: North has a typical problem, which I usually solve by just raising to 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: yes partner might have only 3 but other calls distort.  Plus raising comes in handy if partner can compete to the three level with four or five clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=BAL, 8-10|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|joest: some would try negative double and hope to survive.  I used to do that but gave it up|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hey kit|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play that a double (or 1@S) covers 4 or 5 spades, you can use the remaining action as take-out for the minors, but that is not standard.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ira and Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: it is becoming a more popular treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Hi Kit, Hi Larry|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hi Ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Al|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Since South had not promised four clubs with his opening bid, he feels entitled to compete one level higher.|pg||
nt|kit: tricky hand to play due to the diamond blockage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible via   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: I don't see bidding 3@H with 4-3-3-3, 4 clubs, 3 hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can expect his partner to be very short in clubs and hopes that his 9 points will be enough 3@H, despite holding only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: both 3@C and 3@H need to make to show a real profit, and that just isn't likely|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: It appears that with favorable trump lie, Rodwell will discard 2 spades on his long diamonds to make 4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: He cannot expect his side to hold 9 hearts between them, or West would have doubtless bid 3@H himself, following the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: and with a stiff club West might have bid 3@H anyway with offensive orientation|pg||
nt|kit: and not surprisingly, it is likely that both contracts will go down 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fans of the Law of Total Tricks will smile tolerantly and say 'What did they expect?'|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd pretty much has to hope South has ace-doubleton of hearts to even have a chance|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention that the ace of spades is on side|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|kit: South is "marked" with ace of hearts, since North is assumed to have ace of spades|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|larrymori: he can pitch 2 @cs too|pg||
nt|chorush: but he may have to guess well to do it right|pg||
nt|larrymori: he needs to play on @ds now|pg||
nt|chorush: He has to worry that if he draws the next rump, when he leads a diamond they will win, blocking the suit and destroy the entry to his hand in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- he doesn't know opponents can't lead a second club|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|kit: or suppose opponents just duck 2 rounds of diamonds.  then he only has 5 trumps, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs for sure|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: However, it will be very difficult for Boyd to find this defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: he is playing along dummy reversal lines -- perhaps planning on ruffing another club, hoping diamonds 3-3, and then end-playing opponents -- very sensible |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: 3@C did indeed go one off at the other table, as can see (top left), so this third heart by East was not a wise investment. Fortunately, the stakes are low.|pg||
nt|larrymori: thats why it seemed that he needed to attack @ds after 2 rounds of trumps while he had 2 entries|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: that risked a club or diamond getting ruffed|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome Cornelia|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks   unless A@S led|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  losing trick count (6 losers) suggests raising to 3@h only but that sound weaker after the overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus trump support is very good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both pairs play fairly standard 5 card Major, sound 2/1 methods, except that NS will always open a 5 card Major in preference to a 6 card minor (but I don't think they go to ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson's extreme of opening 5-8 with the Major :))|pg||

nt|brolucius: Add 4 more IMPs to the Total Tricks scales.|pg||
nt|joest: teh 14-16 NT range prevented north from getting his spade suit in|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: i guess that is 15 after all|pg||
nt|joest: but just barely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It always takes a hand or two for the VGOP to warm up.|pg||
nt|kit: I think his play was the sensible one|pg||
nt|larrymori: sure but you have to take a position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: big swing on opening lead at other table|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: key was 2 of clubs lead 3/5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: After the Stayman auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3NT, you should favor a major-suit lead. Do not worry that responder holds a major; worry instead that the opener does not and will be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well-stocked in the minor suits.|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: the jack of hearts looks fairly normal|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson-Boyd play puppet -- this will hurt them, since West will show 4 hearts|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|4H|nt|kit: now double of 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: which will warn them, so they can survive in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a chance to double.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, invite or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson considering.  Becker doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will likely shoot out 4@H, and at the unfavorable vul. Rodwell will have to sell out|pg||
nt|larrymori: cons raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod did have Intermediate 2@S available|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chorush: 4 hearts is beatable but mostly double dummy, so 4S down 1 may in fact be a paying save|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: assuming North doubles, the key will be whether Robinson-Boyd have the understandings to determine they have no spade stopper|pg||
nt|joest: there are other variations of Puppet that avoid this risk but this is the 'original' version.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit, did you invent this or am I imagining things?|pg||
nt|kit: didn't invent it, but I did publicize it|pg||
nt|joest: so now the trick is to get to 5@c and keep the loss to a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson's pass denies a spade stopper -- or at least, it should|pg||
nt|joest: Your name is attached to it in my mind :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: now at this point what all is forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: To beat 4H, a diamond must be led without touching spades. Then the spade Q is an entry to beat the contract 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this redouble is just a repeat --|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was no doubt thinking of bidding 3@C on the previous round, but he can bid it now.|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like they will survive and get to 5@C|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|kit: yes, that is pretty double-dummy, so in practice Rodwell did well to take the vul vs. not save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cole raised to 2@S naturally after Becker 2@C [vs Robinson DBL]|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were lucky that Pettis did not have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: Nicely done -- unlucky to still lose 3 imps on it|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is unlikely so good save|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: I don't mind opening 1NT on East's shape, but it was a bit of a stretch with Q-J doubleton and such a relatively poor 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks like three more to Spector|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're also playing 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H never mentioned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubled  --   sorry I missed Peter Boyd's final bid  :(|pg||
nt|chorush: So this looks like 3 imps to Robinson for the double|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd-Robinson were unlucky here that the auction let North double 2@S.  More normally Puppet has the advantage of concealing declarer's distribution.|pg||
nt|kit: 1NT might not be ideal, but that alternatives are really awful|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously that's the first pickup for Robinson that is NOT double-digit|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to open 1@C and rebid 1NT, shaving off a point.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yorkbeach:  How many @s do you overcall on the North hand?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|yorkbeach:  7222 and adverse vulnerability suggest keeping low|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that East raises clubs rather than negative X|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H might well make e/w   only complete ddouble dummy defence beats 4@H|pg||
nt|chick: maybe the Neg X would show a few more values|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: 2@C only requires 4 clubs and 13 cards|pg||
nt|ady: seems the hearts getting lost|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  4@s a poor contract, going down even with the @cA onside, though North does expect the @cA onside on the bidding|pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: this hand will test how low the Meckwellopeing bid requirement go|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting play of top @D from dummy   -   i wish i could think of that type of psychological play  before it is made at the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: Meckwell can take first 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- are you a 1@S or 1N bidder over 1@H?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
nt|kit: 6 top tricks, but hard to see where  7 will come from|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
nt|kit: I always bypass 4-card spade suit -- can get it back if partner is strong, and makes bidding much easier when partner knows I'm unbalanced for the 1@S rebid.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||
nt|kit: normal style here -- count over attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: North does not know that South hasn't the @HQ.|pg||
nt|kit: obviously North can never find the play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: always bypass when balanced, that is.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c8|nt|kit: Rodwell pretty much has to pitch a diamond I think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: so what do I know?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't see much difference between a heart or a club lead. The swing was mainly due to luck.|pg||
nt|larrymori: Cole shifted to a @d in the same position to earn 200|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: yes, even in 'duplicate' there is luck|pg||
nt|kit: I see a lot of difference -- 12 IMPs difference, to be exact|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|joest: north south would seem destined for 3NT here|pg||
nt|kit: might not be so simple with East being 6-5|pg||
nt|kit: and West having 4-card diamond support|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: if the auction times out in such a fashion that Robinson gets to show his @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: Probably responsive double by Rodwell here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: Meck might bid 2@H -- not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: probably queen of diamonds played by Robinson at trick 1|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry about that.|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like most routes lead to down 1|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Kit's line looks better than a club to the ace.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest: a lot would depend on what west pitched on the spade jack too|pg||
nt|kit: maybe not -- East have had stiff king|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he was interested to find East with a single @CK.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|kit: Boyd leads count card back, so Robinson knows Boyd has 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: will have to finesse I think|pg||
nt|kit: which may lead to down 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd should be able to work out from this line of play that declarer has bid a 3-bagger.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c3|nt|kit: Declarer will simply take heart finesse and go down 1 -- noth much else left|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||

nt|kit: Robinson has the problem of being locked out of both hands.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: 3NT should only be 'very wrong' when partner has mis-bid. South has just about what he has shown with regard to supporting a 3NT contract.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Becker should cash the third diamond before playing on clubs, so defense won't have a diamond exit -- but not many players think of this|pg||

nt|kit: This one is a legitimately dull deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Becker has stolen Spector's spades from before|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Not sure Jack; hearts might be dead and buried after 3@D|pg||
nt|joest: that's the risk you run for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was going to say that anything other than a 4@S rebid would be bizarre.|pg||
nt|kit: I think Boyd should double -- provided double is primarily penalties as I think it should be.|pg||
nt|larrymori: this is a big steal of vul game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  24  the other room   P-1@C-DBL-3@C//DBL-5@C-P-P//5@D-DBL-end|pg||
nt|larrymori: question of system, if X is 3 suited takeout and 4nt is 2 suited takeout he has to pass|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|joest: you are also endplayed after 1NT if partner bids 2C or 2S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does 3@D over 2@C show this type?|pg||
nt|joest: it does if you agree so :)  I have seen folks play that fit-showing as well|pg||
nt|kit: spector considering making this not such a dull deal after all|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure what 3@h was|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very thoughtful of him to consider the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|joest: but it appears Spector treated as natural|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a shot to get to 3NT if partner bids it, planning on signing off at 4@S otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Unfortunately, I cannot read the notes from here.|pg||
nt|joest: the fact that he is still thinking however is threatening to 'undull' this deal :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The Commentators' Curse strikes again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did think about 3@H as a no-trump problem, but it seems a bit risky. 4@S is the world's safest rebid.|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||
nt|brolucius: no-trump probe..|pg||
nt|kit: 4 of a previously bid major is to play.  Period.  End of story.  A very good agreement all partnerships should have.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That was a lot of thinking for a pass.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, they get to 4@S. No harm in entertaining us a bit along the way.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, no swing -- but at least it wasn't dull for the specs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Landen is taking it all a bit seriously at the other table, rebidding 4@S.|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will likely shift to a trump here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Hoping declarer has 3 clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly a vlaid point, but you could keep making his hand better with the same distribution til he had to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that doesn't sound right Larry -- a) equal level conversion may apply [so 5@C-5@D]  b) DBL gets left in a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and c)  meckwell are notorious crooks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: But they are very pleasant about it at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: Bridge-wise, if you reach into you rpocket to get your wallet you may shake hands with one of them|pg||
nt|larrymori: I do not know their agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd asks about the style of weak two.|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are unlikely to score three club tricks then.|pg||
nt|kit: right -- but he has 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players lead the ace from 4, others the king. Both sets swear that their method is easily best.|pg||
nt|joest: I've never been sure when to lead the ace vs. the king in that system.  Maybe David can explain it.  He's written a book that covers it!|pg||
nt|kit: Good result for N-S in other room -- might not be duplicated|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chorush: Rodwell can, if he wishes, jump to 4H intheir system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24, 5@DX went down 2   i thought it had play for down 1, but still 6 imps for Spector|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Meck was unable to support diamonds after a Precision 1@D|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR @H|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: and the 2@D raise makes North's 2@H call more competitive rather than constructive|pg||

nt|kit: why?|pg||
nt|kit: if partner passes 2@H I'm probably high enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H constructive, but NF|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding you may want to compete against 2@D with quite a modest hand including fair hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play the same with no interference, Kit?|pg||

nt|kit: yes -- 3 double figure swings vs. 0, and match still very close|pg||
nt|chorush: If your partnership has a rule that there are no preempts over preempts, then maybe 4 spades should do the trick|pg||
nt|kit: there must be strict rules which cover this auction (and others)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, 17+ bal|pg||
nt|kit: that is my rule -- 4@S not a preempt over a preempt, therefore bid to make voluntarily, therefore in force.  But I'm not guessing.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As we were all saying.... an excellent raise by East on the first round!|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 2N=game force 4441@C/@D|pg||
nt|larrymori: thats me too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meck can ask for shortness or set trump suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|kit: Lucky slam here -- they won't get there after this start I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Meck will be more interested if partner has stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does ASK|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|nt|brolucius: What does 6+4+2 come to?|pg||
nt|kit: Should Becker open 1@S or 2@C?  Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|joest: partner could have spade queen, diamond queen, heart ace|pg||
nt|joest: but those values are hard to locate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4441@D|pg||
nt|kit: do they play rkc relay here?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess not needed -- Meckstroth can just set trumps with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL changes things -- but I bet it gives Meck MORE room|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|4D|nt|joest: i don't think Becker is passing|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he might move now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open 1@S. It gets too messy after 2@C with 6-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL, i think after 3@D   4@C=RKC @H  4@D=RKC @S|pg||
nt|kit: Even with king of diamonds wasted Meckstroth can still picture possible perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he bid 3@H?  There clearly can be no value to playing 4-4 fit opposite the 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|chorush: Picturing perfectos can be an expensive experience. Hamman says "If you need the perfect hand, I don't have it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@H is a RELAY [not setting trump]   with DBL, we need Walter|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps to set up a RKC for hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod writing a lot of explanation to Robinson.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at some point, Rod describes strength of hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|kit: So he will bid the slam|pg||
nt|joest: yes they are still mid auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: but if he asks about the trump queen, they might still hang short|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double surely means that West has the @DA and South has the @HA.|pg||
nt|kit: but partner might have xxxx of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HA is not such a good card, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: the double surely means only 1 diamond loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Becker thinks: '2-2 break at worst'.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|joest: yeah.  + partner might table Jxx or spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: So many IMPs riding on the lie of the cards. |pg||
nt|kit: good perecentage bid by Becker.  Unlucky about the double of 5@D.  Without that, I think Becker would have asked for queen of trumps and stopped.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what Rod said with DBL -- but they did nice job of stopping at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod: "trying to show some extras."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "This won't take long."|pg||
mc|11|nt|chorush: Yes. It was very helpful for Meckstroth to know that Rodwell was specifically 4-4-1-4|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set|pg||
nt|kit: I like Becker's bid.  Gains when partner has xxxx of spades, okay if partner has Jxx, and if xxx, at worst 40%.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Ross, our excellent operator in Toronto. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|joest: yes thanks Ross!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great work, Ross!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, David, Jack and Kit|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  as before   2@D=bal 8-10, no 5+ suit  3N=signoff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: We will be back after a short break, perhaps 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks.  I've had a great time.|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead would be quite successful here -- should South overcall 2@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We should not let the last hand go without noting that a double of a Blackwood 5@D response on the @DA is not necessarily a wise move. You can see how it helped North here, at both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tables. It is different when you double a cue-bid with a high card sitting over the cue-bidder's high card.|pg||
nt|joest: a spade lead gives this a rough ride|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like routine 3NT headed down 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not -- Robinson has 109 of spades, so he will be under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: After a heart lead this is no gimme|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: Robinson not only has the 109 of spades but also the only diamond guard|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: So heart lead, win, lose club hook, continue hearts, win, run clubs.  Robinson pitches 1 diamond, and then what?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: or even a heart lead and spade shift.  But difficult to fault club lead when hitting partner with just ace of clubs can be instant set.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|kit: Declarer will still have to sweat North having ace of hearts since the spades will block, but all is well.|pg||
nt|joest: other room: heart lead + spade shift|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|chorush: so I think this hand is makeable but needs some guessing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: whoa   last board of the 1st half   restart scheduled to begin in about 2 hours|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will have to pitch a spade|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Well, it was an entertaining session - very enjoyable. No need to complain about the dull deals on this occasion.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|cT|nt|brolucius: I will certainly be back when the Spingold starts on Wednesday - one of the best events of the year.|pg||
nt|kit: Bud will Rodwell play for this, or play Boyd for Kx of spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe somebody on site can scope out scores in the LM Pairs|pg||
nt|kit: Now spade to jack, and when honor appears he will rethink.|pg||
nt|kit: I would expect he will get it right and play for this layout.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to play on spades to have any chance, so spade hook must be on.|pg||
nt|chorush: Robinson would always play spade 9 or 10 from 109xx so there is a guess involved|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson might have started with 109xx, QJxxx, Jx, Kx and discarded exactly the same way.|pg||
nt|chorush: Would you cash the diamond ace to see if, perhaps the diamond K has been blanked?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- spade hook first, then diamond to ace|pg||
nt|kit: spade hook always a must|pg||
nt|chorush: right, that will occur anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: now diamond to ace, and here we will be|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all specs for watching. We will be back soon with the second quarter|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: As pointed out, Robinson would (should!) always falsecard from the remaining holding of 109x, so 9 of spades not necessarily honest|pg||
nt|kit: He knows (or can assume) Robinson has the 10, but that doesn't solve the problem.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30 [our 5@D-4]   Becker playing a quiet 4@S EAST  after an unusual vs unusual auction|pg||
nt|chorush: Note that Boyd played the spade 6 and kept the 2, perhaps trying to influence Rodwell that Robinson was retaining the 2|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Robinson doesn't have to have king of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell gunts in frustration and dives back into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which gets us to      this is now a 34 board matcch|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's jack of diamonds might have been his last diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell: "Feels like a coin toss."|pg||
nt|kit: so Rodwell doesn't have the count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd: "Canadian or American."|pg||
nt|kit: he has the heart count, yes, but that isn't enough to tell him the shape|pg||
nt|chorush: well, there are more 5-3-3-2 hands than 5-4-2-2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
mc|9|nt|chorush: very nicely done by Rodwell.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT does not seems comfortable on expected heart lead?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  one black finesse works, the other does not|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: just needs one of the black finesses to come in|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Traditionalists will be pleased to see a fourth highest lead|pg||
nt|granguru: @C will be attaqcked first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Palmer asks "your leads are 4th best, right?" Becker: "yes, sometimes top or second from worthless holdings"|pg||
nt|granguru: attacked|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru: is it fair to make such a question here?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|chick: as some kibs are pointing out to me, she also needs a 3rd spade or a diamond trick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|athene: when you run the clubs east gets squeezed in three suits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 2@s 2H 1@d 3@c = 8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: he has to come down to @S109 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: then you pin the ten|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s 2@h 1@d 3@c = 8|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  might have been better to play one round of spades earlier|pg||
nt|granguru: or LI YUN |pg||
nt|athene: after a spade to the jack and 9/10, then diamond to ace, declarer still has a guess, if she assumes east is good enough to find the obligatory falsecard of dropping a high spade ...|pg||
