mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|mug: I don't suppose it's often 12 NV but a game try is reasonable|pg||
nt|brolucius: A-K-x-x-x-x gives him eight top tricks, plus a diamond finesse, so he should surely at least look for a game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: the hands fit badly|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|benjy:  Non vul i think it is very pushy to look for game, vul i agree i would enquire|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mug: 3NT is probably the best practical contract|pg||

nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|riccho:  we all made revokes. THe difference is in handling the situation afterwards|pg||

nt|copeyj: 4@H a decent contract N/S single dummy, but does not look likely to make on this layout|pg||

pc|dT|nt|gronkvist:  A sporty 1 Nt bid here ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shows (very) weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||

nt|chrisky: me ta atou 2-2 np|pg||
nt|mamos: it just appears that with two trump losers this is a doomed albeit very normal conytract|pg||
nt|copeyj: Horrible choice of leads for Shah - @D seems normal|pg||
nt|copeyj: Once declarer runs this round, he may well just play @D towards Q and @D back - which would make when @H not 4-1 or if W had stiff K or 10 or E had stiff 10|pg||
pc|dA|nt|loe48: look like 500, 3 down with a fast view|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes many would bid 3N, gives less away and NT a likely contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||

nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||

nt|brolucius: Once the diamond finesse works, you lay down your cards and say 'I will take the safety play in trumps'. The defenders will be too embarrassed to query the claim.|pg||

nt|mug: I would bid game|pg||
nt|mug: partner didn't have to bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some players tell you that it is a waste of time to raise the hearts on a weak hand such as South's, but it removes a whole level of bidding and there is much to be said for it. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can cue-bid instead (as we saw earlier) when you have a sound raise.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjy:  if 1@C is 3+ cards you would bid game?|pg||

nt|mug: only with a terrible opener|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|raghavan: Both teams seem balance not much exchange of IMP let us see whether this trend continues|pg||
nt|raghavan: Even if DQ not played where will D loser go |pg||
nt|vasmar: and a heart ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|vasmar: club lead is bad for declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzjm: 29 points and two queens to caych for making 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mug: be interesting to see what club North uses here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Personally, I have a very good record for finding missing queens - almost 50%.|pg||
nt|mug: a splinter 3@S, or minor-suit Stayman, or even a transfer?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mug: I don't know what 3@C is|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|brolucius: If trumps were 2-2 with the @HK onside, you could eliminate spades and exit with the third round of hearts., |pg||
nt|mug: 6@D is not bad as @HK might be onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: 3@c =5@d4+1c and 3@s is cue|pg||
nt|mug: so how does the South hand rate facing 5@D 4@C?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or, of course, discard the last heart....|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|mug: double is helpful|pg||
mb|r!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjm: space saving|pg||
nt|mug: diamonds first, then a heart finesse|pg||
mb|4D!|an|RKCB|mb|p|nt|mug: when he cashes the third heart West will show out|pg||
mb|4S!|an|0/3|nt|brolucius: Yes! Well, the play wil be interesting. That's for sure.|pg||
nt|mug: as an England fan I'm hopeful|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: before the double I think North was supposed to bid 3NT and leave it to South, that might have been that|pg||
nt|mug: curiously, it looks like the effect of the double may be to propel them higher|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are still going to be 10 points missing (some of which are now known to be West's spades). Seems ambitious to look for a slam on North's cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: because now North might expect S not to have wasted values in @ss|pg||
nt|mug: this is likely to lead him to place West with more club length, and finesse him for the queen|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: North doesn't know about South's wasted @SQ|pg||
nt|mug: he was hopeful it would be elsewhere|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  (+4)|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not sure I agree with the trump lead here - If declarer had removed 3NT to 5@D then there's a slight clue that declarer has clubs as the source of tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  also a clue that he was worried about a suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  maybe cashing @SAK and hope for 3rd trick|pg||
nt|eleni: wd Ron due to opps' misplay|pg||

nt|runnerup: and it came so vulnerable game won -but can you avoid that lead --hard to say|pg||
nt|blum1956: a lively set ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer lucky trumps were 2-2 so he has an entry but even if East has 3 he would ruff the @c and be endplayed . Declarer would have to guess the @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: after declarer draws only 2rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|riccho:  declarer is perhaps delighted, that this contract was still made|pg||
nt|eleni: so 1 more IMP for our Czech girls|pg||
nt|mancio89:  both poland and french declarer were not as good as she was|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: while there is an almost impossible defence to 3 clubs, in practice its a likely make|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S erxontai, mporei kai na vgoun|pg||

mb|p|nt|roussol: edo iparhei mans travihti|pg||
nt|andy_h: she* Gerben!|pg||
nt|smirny: i would lead ace of S probably|pg||
nt|panja: the @HT lead.....could be from KT9, QT9, T9 etc...absolutely no reason to duck...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 key cards missing, so no slam.|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S max her|pg||
nt|copeyj: 6@D can make on this deal - but not to say it's a great spot. Switch South's @SQ to @C and it would be though - let's see how the Czechs approach it|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sharkey: Press "Refresh" button|pg||
nt|panja: B6, once again, W has a poor hand and E opens..|pg||
nt|rubrean:  Tror det blir vanskelig for nord Ã¥ komme med etter denne innledningen|pg||
nt|andreasw:  mÃ¥sk et slutspil til 10 i 4@c vis man ikke finder @D skiftet eller udspil pÃ¥ S hÃ¥nd?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  right|pg||
nt|panja: and now...if N passes, will E bid further?|pg||
nt|panja: N should not pass as he know EW have a good @H fit...|pg||
nt|eleni: another misfit though|pg||
nt|panja: and if E escapes to 1@H..and W raises..it will be difficult to get in later..|pg||
nt|panja: so bidding 2@D now..is the best option|pg||
nt|runnerup: a possible slam -down ofcause but ..|pg||
nt|runnerup: i would say only @h lead let it make|pg||
nt|rensph: 4@H for NS here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a lot of goodies NS here|pg||
nt|copeyj: big @C again|pg||

nt|riccho:  How aggressive 3@s is, can you see, if you imagine the S Hand without the @sQ. That would be not even an opener, at least in my book|pg||
nt|eleni: let us jope Megherita will keep the bidding low|pg||
nt|riccho:  at least S is not showing the void with 5NT or so|pg||

nt|smirny: but 3nt is too much i think|pg||
nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||
nt|eleni: a feature|pg||
nt|spenny80: but after 3 round in @s north MUST play @d |pg||
nt|runnerup: ns ofcause|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: another part score hand, even for our agressive youth:)|pg||

nt|chick: East has a pretty nice hand with 3 aces, a singleton, A of opps suit, and 6-4 distrib|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even 3 spades can fall to ruffs perhaps|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like -2 on a @DA lead and continuation|pg||
nt|rensph: scoring 4 trumps in defense and 2 red aces|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its a harsh life|pg||
nt|copeyj: Pass probably says he likes @C (from Shah)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so a small chance for England - although unlikely to bid a slam imo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|desinka: hello everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Desi @H|pg||
nt|desinka: may 2@D vs prec club is narural|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to start the clubs early|pg||
nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2nt usually means minors, looks like not for EW|pg||

nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome William|pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|blum1956: The only chance for the defense was a trump switch in the second trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H can be made if EW dont play @S...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: excellent 9/10 hcp :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south should bid 4@H over 3@D trying to show how good his hand is for hearts |pg||
nt|athene: he must think 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|gmarco24: follow results on: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||

nt|andy_h: It seems like the Swede counterpart in the other room had a hard time on Board 7 with the trump play. Rather than guessing trumps the declarer tried to strip the hand by ruffing a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: heart csahing @SA and playing on clubs, but when North was able to ruff the 3rd club with the @SK declarer had to guess the diamonds - had he guessed wrong it would have resulted ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: in 9 tricks but infact came out with one overtrick ;)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  unlikely to find @C position due to "restricted choice"|pg||
nt|smirny: well expensive board...probably a 26IMPS guess|pg||
nt|smirny: but after weak in D (2@C)|pg||
nt|smirny: you can find it|pg||

nt|smirny: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: on s habitue a cette sensation désagréable|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andy_h: Observe the disparity between the 2@C (weak diamond bids) in this board and on board 5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Then he has to decide if he plays clubs to run or diamonds to run|pg||
nt|le joker: étant donné son résidu à @h Ouest aurait presque pu entamer @s|pg||

nt|spenny80: a psichic cue?|pg||

pc|c9|nt|eleni: It all depends on his inspiration for the @d|pg||

nt|bagman: My guess is that E plays a diamond to the ace now|pg||
nt|bagman: it is the best combination of possibilities|pg||
nt|bagman: clubs running or diamond queen doubleton|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  :)|pg||
nt|panja: but now, when E exits with a trump, N will be endplayed..so the guess is eliminated|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|benjy:  luckily he has escaped unscathed|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: maybe brass could not believe declarer would do that without the @C10|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: No, but could he not count declarer for 9 tricks in that case?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|athene: but you can count him for nine tricks if he has @HK and @C10 |pg||

pc|hT|pc|c9|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: after winning the diamond in hand declarer could just have led a club to the king and then cashed the spades; now there is no possible way south can get five tricks|pg||
nt|athene: a pity the english pair could not find a way to catch their opponents speeding in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember the days when it was normal to pass when you held only 1 point. (A long time ago now.) |pg||
nt|athene: how about double (extras) from west over 1nt, and then double (takeout) of 2@H from east, and then pass ("gotcha!") from west?|pg||

nt|rensph: welcome David :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx    hi all|pg||
nt|ady: looks a part score hand   |pg||
nt|rensph: declarer in the other room will be making 5@D on bd 9, by ruffing a heart and giving up on the double @D finesse. More imps to Croatia|pg||

nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||
nt|runnerup: now|pg||
nt|blum1956: some pairs have an agreement that bidding the responder's suit is natural but this is rarely applicable to the opener's suit|pg||
nt|panosk: sosta paizoun 41-30|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: my partners always think they have shown what they happen to have|pg||

nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  modern approach is to bid 1NT even with subminimum hands. Goal is to silence the bidding for NS. |pg||

nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: applies to NS too|pg||

pc|cA|nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||
nt|riccho:  In defense most of the time the problem is to decide whether you play an acitve or a passive defense. Here N chose the active one and would have better chosen the passive line|pg||

pc|h2|nt|richie: 4S fortunately undoubled, could be bloody|pg||

nt|brolucius: South had 7 non-hearts to North's 10, so why play him for three trumps?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well, west was wondering why north bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't realise it was just general happiness|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|athene: he thought it was a singleton spade|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|benjy:  perhaps the 8@D was misleading from south|pg||
nt|benjy:  why not the 9@D?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjm: sry it was @d 9|pg||

nt|benjy:  in which case north should have ducked the Q|pg||
nt|benjy:  K rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: but N still took the Ace|pg||
nt|richie: south has to play to double void now so -3 as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|riccho:  I dont like the 2@h bid. shape misdescription is generally not a good idea in hands with slam potential|pg||

nt|bagman: A spade ruff beats 3@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  since 2@C was not GF, must bid 3@S now to confirm fit|pg||
nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nothing worse than a slipping behing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||

nt|loe48: ta i bordet og spill ruter|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this contract not clear on the lead...|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: perhaps a club is ducked trick 2|pg||
nt|mamos: well no one doubled so it's not all bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as Simon points out only 9 tricks in hearts, I forgot the trump ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||

nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||
nt|panja: good bidding on this one...simple and effective...note that S avoided a jump to 3@D..|pg||

nt|frankbo: 5 ned i 3 rut|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sunsamvar: The Dutch boys in the Open reached the good 5@D contract on bd 10|pg||
nt|neobas: Looks like a solid 6@C here|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@C  if seeing all the cards   meantime 5@C best|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: diamond ace hidden behind the 2, happened to me last week|pg||

mb|3C|nt|neobas: Though the fit will have to be found at the four-level|pg||

nt|copeyj: Shah overcalling 2@C because he wants the lead and it is very preemptive over 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes the pass was a bit timid... maybe the 1@D opening did not promise @Ds|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  hmm other table didnt make 4@S... |pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@s aggressive but he makes|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -but 4 makes|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H   shortage  agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: running scores and more: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west will do anything with such a poor opening  and over half the strength opposite the shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer cannot try to ruff out the hearts and then fall back on clubs in 6@S as there are not enough entries for that|pg||
nt|helena sp:  good mornig to you all, good luck to our kids|pg||
nt|vasmar: nice stop|pg||

nt|pierreco: il faut avoir une défense contre le 2sa bico mineure|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still has not found that ace|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chrisky: 1nt?|pg||
nt|rensph: given the EW hands 6@C seems like a reasonable contract, but unlikely to be made. Or reached.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: excellent and lets claim:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  if partner has only 1Kc but reverse values (3@c), 7@d should be a big contract|pg||
nt|yusufb: celik 2nt demesi lazýmdý|pg||
nt|loe48: i aapent?|pg||
nt|ritong: disons qu il faut etre au point sur la signification de 3@d dans la séquence de la donne précédente, sur 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: cud be - the aggressive bidding by West paid off - perhaps too aggressive some may say|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||
nt|gmarco24: ok, cut this and deal a goulash|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: would have to play J@S    playing north for 10X to make 12 tricks    unlikely play|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: With the @H finesse in reserve you can first see if the @SQ drops|pg||
nt|rensph: in this case both fail, but more than 50%|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont see why Schwartz didnt Q bid|pg||

nt|raghavan: Hasan tell me why Braun did not bid his 4 cd H?|pg||
nt|roussol: 1@h is made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H for NS is making, but outbid in both rooms.|pg||
nt|eleni: now a @h lead to the weakness of the dummy would be great|pg||
nt|rensph: looks like another solid 4@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: i wd try a @H|pg||
nt|bagman: in 6@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: so par looks like 4 @s x-2|pg||

pc|h6|nt|famus: i think this was a forcing chk back--or nmf--dunno--if forcing then 3@ds shows 5 cards|pg||

nt|loe48: den skal vel meldes ut eller?|pg||
nt|rensph: I like 2NT, rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
nt|vasmar: this can be a crucial board|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult bidding though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if its natural, its the alert that worried me|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@d seems cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: and 7 if you ruff 2 clubs or make 3@S tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: 8 med single kloever og makke tigget|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Mikael fandt @d udspillet|pg||

nt|le joker: swing chez les youngsters français sur la fameuse 10: 5@c = dans une salle et 5@dX = dans l'autre |pg||
nt|ritong: miam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
nt|rubrean:  / gode spill|pg||
nt|andreasw:  pas og kridt dine 7 stik|pg||
nt|chick: at least it's S, so the heart lead is less likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: akward hand for NS, but they usually end in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
nt|rensph: E can signal for a heart switch on a diamond lead though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and as west must win the first club we are hopeful|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
nt|eleni: oooooooooooops a passive bid|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think 4NT by N should be more accurate|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Flavia keepos it on|pg||
nt|chrisky: if u ruff 2 @C no need 3@S|pg||

nt|vasmar: N never decribed her 17 count|pg||
nt|chick: Right Rens, and W won't want to lead @Ds again anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: double manche is good for you|pg||
pc|dT|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||

nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mug: Botur's pass is a bit odd, but the effect may be to buy it in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: most would not pass with east hand after 1@S X but maybe he is too strong for immediate 2@S and no artificial good raise to 2|pg||
nt|mug: maybe Brass can come again with 2NT?|pg||
nt|richie: strange that E doesnt raise directly to 2S|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: so he thinks delayed 2@S is that hand|pg||
nt|richie: maybe will be awarded by a double :)|pg||
nt|athene: not a fan of the double|pg||
nt|benjy:  i agree i like 2nt showing both minors|pg||
nt|athene: why not 2nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|athene: you don't want partner to pass the double or bid hearts :)|pg||
nt|benjy:  north should bid 3@D either way as pd can correct with 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: good old scrambling 2nt saves the day, anyway|pg||
nt|benjy:  or scramble with 2nt|pg||
nt|mug: ok so long as North understood the dbl was non-penalty|pg||
nt|benjy:  wasn't X just showing a good hand for 2@C|pg||
nt|benjy:  and hence north should bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|benjy:  perhaps a 2nt scarmble covers all bases|pg||

mb|2C|nt|roussol: he must abandon @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: Hello all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: welcome Pierre|pg||
nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||
nt|galois85: I totally don't like opening 1nt with 5-4-2-2, but just my opinion|pg||

nt|panosk: mpa o kairos drosise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: maybe south should have bid the boring 6@S and argued it out afterwards|pg||
nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||

mb|p|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: They should  be playing 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||
nt|blum1956: well, dummy discards two spades, three clubs and one heart. Whatever declarer then leads he is home |pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: This is a convention rarely used.  voluntarily bid 3NT doubled means lead spade|pg||
nt|rensph: 3NT a bit rough, partner might not have a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|chrisky: a 6@S contract for ew is here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d only???|pg||
nt|ady: game could be made if spade is guessed and defence does not find early heart play to give a ruff|pg||
nt|ady: fair odds for down 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - I saw South open, SORRY!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still instructive...|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 2@c asks partner to bid 2@d unless he has extras|pg||
nt|poohbear: but not sure|pg||
nt|loe48: where norway stopped in 3h,,danmark doublet 3spar..saa mer imp inn til danmark|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  okay - i will NOT always lead the lowest trump|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  you convinced me|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess most EW pairs will wander into 4@H and go down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or was I wrong again?:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes |pg||
nt|poohbear: this is definitely a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|chrisky: hope|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 4 imps by srange bidding perhaps|pg||
nt|raghavan: I used this convention 3NTX Spade lead when I visited singapore some years back 3 times success|pg||

nt|famus: @s from E--wud b interesting|pg||
nt|rensph: was there an actual pause for thought there by W?|pg||

mb|2H!|an|GF, 5+!Hs|nt|richie: still, should be possible to find heart fit and just settle down in 4H|pg||

nt|mug: three rounds of hearts stand up, and you have three black tops, can you manage five trump tricks?|pg||
nt|richie: no, seems 5 diamonds should be always down|pg||

nt|chrisky: 5 @h IS OK FOR EW|pg||
nt|loe48: this line had zero chanse|pg||
nt|athene: if he finds out he definitely can't, then leading @CQ is the best shot|pg||
nt|athene: singleton @CK sorry|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3 tables at 420 on previous board !!|pg||
nt|spenny80: N/s need a break|pg||
nt|galois85: but only with 3 cards in all minors, you can guess after double they can switch to a 5m...|pg||
nt|ady: good result for Croatia|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lets see what shenanigans Fisher cooks up here in 3rd seat favorable :)|pg||

nt|famus: this cud b  another swing--has the potential|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hasan - what do u think if Heart was not ruffed by W|pg||
nt|rensph: playing for the drop is usually better but the odds aren't that far apart. Declarer did well to take the overcall into consideration.|pg||
nt|loe48: jeg ville fortelle en moro historie som jeg opplevde nylig.. det var at en spiller aapnet svake 2, 3 ganger samme spill..er ikke det en rekord? :)|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|sunsamvar: earlier was 2 suitor|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: thats why you clean side suits before play heart|pg||

nt|rensph: Surely they will. It's a week of intensive training for all participants. Very exhausting, too.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||

nt|richie: yes, I believe so|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: slam for desert|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: both 6 @D and 6@H are makeable|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mug: any idea what your pair are doing here, Richie?|pg||
nt|richie: 6 D seems to be a bit better, declarer just needs to ruff one heart there and does not have enough entries to finesse hearts twice|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: this is the last boar for today, thanks to BBO, European Bridge League, Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Albena - the best bulgarian sea resort for making this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|richie: 2 clubs is really strange to me|pg||
nt|mug: 20 boars tomorrow to determine England's fate|pg||
nt|richie: I believe 2 spades would show 12+ with spades, 2 clubs maybe shows some invitational hand|pg||
nt|mug: and some of them may be wild boars :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: thanks to our excellent commentators and to all kibitzers, wish you good evening and hope to see you tomorrow for the FINAL rounds of both (Juniors and Youngsters) series at 9 AM ...|pg||

nt|richie: strange, without being agreed on trump suit|pg||
nt|benjy:  Thanks all|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|richie: 6 diamonds probably suggestion to play, but must be confusing for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: not too convinced by this auction, but it will cost England another 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|richie: fortunately one entry is enough here to finesse hearts and claim the slam making|pg||
nt|mug: it's a poor contract|pg||
nt|richie: more shooting in this bidding rather then science, true|pg||
nt|richie: yes, not very good contract, 6 diamonds would be much better|pg||
nt|mug: Norway have scored 25 VP and will finish the day on 271, England are currently on 272 but this will cost 2 or 3 VPs|pg||

nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well thanks to all in bulgaria for an instructive set of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks to all in Bulgaria, back tomorrow|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
