nt|athene: get the best suit into it or try to involve the spades too?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Adi Asulin has been a busy young lady. She also played in the girls' event|pg||
nt|nicksan: Going to be difficult for E/W to find the spades..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They finished the day before yesterday|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you do both - bid diamonds first then spades later over hearts|pg||
nt|athene: south might not force to game of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzjt: players took their cards now|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Manolo is our operator, ciao|pg||
nt|athene: of course, after 1@H - 2NT jacoby, maybe 4 of a minor should be leaping michaels|pg||
nt|athene: but then 4 of a minor can always be leaping michaels :)|pg||
nt|mug: good afternoon|pg||
nt|nicksan: it should, but does this hand qualify?|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Tom|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: hello all|pg||
nt|athene: no, 4-7 really isn't the same as 5-5, even close, is it|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Israel having a terrific wave of young players coming through - leading in the juniors and third in the youngsters|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D likely a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|athene: i thought that south might upgrade the hand a bit as a sort of two-way shot - even if you go down in 4@H it is likely to be a decent sacrifice|pg||
nt|mug: thought West might come again there with a double|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|athene: yes, it's never much fun when the hand with the side suit is getting forced|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mug: not convinced about 4@S, suppose you're tapped at trick one, you play a spade to the king, then how do you proceed?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Actually, i want to take that back - i think 4 @S should be beaten|pg||

mb|3C|nt|nicksan: This looks like grand...|pg||
nt|nicksan: But they will do well just to bid 6 @H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|nicksan: X - 5 @H - 6 @H ?|pg||
nt|mug: that's taken out North's blackwood|pg||
nt|athene: the issue now is what north's double means|pg||
nt|mug: I think North has enough to insist on slam|pg||
nt|nicksan: A slow double means "bid" surely?|pg||
nt|mug: double sounds like penalty to me, South has defined his hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you think 4@H has described south's hand quite narrowly, then double should be penalty|pg||
nt|athene: but 4@H can still be quite a range of hands|pg||
nt|mug: but all of them strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is a good hand first of all|pg||
nt|mug: you don't pre-empt over their pre-empt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vul against not over a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: oh yes, strong, certainly|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @H should be a good hand, sure, but it doesn;t have to have all the side suit 1st round controls|pg||
nt|mug: so to my mind Shivam Shah's pass in the CR was a clear underbid|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north decides his partner really has to be void in clubs if the opponents are sane|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Asulin|pg||
nt|mug: no it doesn't promised everything, but looking at the North hand, what else can partner have?|pg||
nt|athene: you are supposed to have an 11-card fit to bid at the 5-level so even allowing EW two extra cards for the vulnerability....|pg||
nt|nicksan: This is why she played in two events simultaneously. Terrific bid!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: sorry. north decided HER partner had to be void in clubs :)|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mug: did she really, that's interesting, no reason why she shouldn't if she's good enough|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: oh  no need, just ruff the diamonds down sorry|pg||
nt|nicksan: Or, alternatively, just ruff out the diamonds...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too simple|pg||
nt|mug: sorry I'm being a bit harsh on Shah, they opened 4@C in the CR, well that was a good bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|athene: yes, 4@H over 3@C promises a lot more than 4@H over 4@C|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|mug: passing 4@H over 4@C is throughly reasonable, apologies|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: that is quite a common tactical bidding idea - if you guess your opponent is about to bid X, you bid enough so that X is not a jump, then it's not clear how strong it is|pg||

nt|galois85: for making the hand was club to ace and club and endplay. 10 to italy|pg||

nt|rnmalik: possible.|pg||
nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||

nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
nt|leao:  stiff ace claimed its toll|pg||

pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||

nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||

pc|h5|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||

nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: some might play in 3NT anyway - this has been a good auction|pg||
nt|nicksan: A third round of Diamonds is best, letting declarer decide right away which major he should set up...|pg||
nt|mug: or declarer can cross-ruff|pg||
nt|nicksan: Yup|pg||
nt|athene: third diamond might be costly if declarer were missing the @HK but that probably isn't possible after 3@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: need to duck 9D maybe..|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey|pg||

nt|daman: they*|pg||
nt|leao:  yep. very bad for morale|pg||
nt|leao:  and at the onset of the match too|pg||
mb|6S|nt|leao:  argh|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
nt|panosk: E must try to ruff a couple of @D losers in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 9@H a value card.|pg||
nt|daman: this will not be good|pg||
nt|leao:  no, it doesnt rate to be, at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  so they start with a 20+ IMP deficit to recover|pg||

nt|leao:  sandwich, i mean|pg||
pc|h9|nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play clubs or Hearts knowing Spade Q is a possible entry|pg||
nt|leao:  at least it wasnt doubled|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|panosk: shud also be carefull of clubs as he/she knows that S is 5-4 at aleast hence no more than 3-4 cards in rest suits|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: I don't have anything much for or against 3@c, it could work if you have a semblence of a fit or if opps bid on, while you may be in another misfit at a higer level on the other ...|pg||
nt|psyck: hand|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to lose 2H unless play 9|pg||

nt|nicksan: Could this be a way into the auction for the English. They can't touch 4 @H, even on a diamond lead...|pg||
nt|mug: splinter shows about 8-11 in the modern game, not a really good hand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they are in the auction, but not yet with spades|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||

nt|z_lasu: dobry wieczor|pg||

nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||

nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|nicksan: yes, and 3 @C is ok etc, but if E/W finds their hearts...|pg||
nt|mug: lead spades I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: responding 1@S is normal but it means you are pretty much resigned to leaving the clubs behind|pg||
nt|athene: will west balance with 2@H? either opponent could still have four hearts and it isn't a fit auction|pg||
nt|nicksan: i would|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't just sit there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the opening had been 1@H, I think you should bypass spades and bid 1NT in order to get out in clubs as cheaply as possible later|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: wow, West caters for his partner holding a monster diamond stack|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: WOuld prefer 2 @H to double by a long way...|pg||

nt|athene: well, king to five and two side aces...what are you supposed to do?|pg||
nt|mug: well what else do you want East to do?|pg||
nt|nicksan: West, not East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Especially because they don't get a game bonus|pg||
nt|athene: one thing that often causes misunderstandings is exactly how defensive/offensive a double is, even if you know it's "takeout"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then again, I would not have doubled with West's cards|pg||
nt|mug: no neither would I but it might have been the winner|pg||
nt|athene: in other words does the double say "ok, pass this only with 6 tricks in your own hand" or does it say "you can pass this on any hand with nothing better to do "|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|nicksan: East's pass is normal. I strongly disagree with West's double though. |pg||

nt|mug: that is the way of the world |pg||
nt|nicksan: That's the advantage of seeing all the hands...|pg||
nt|athene: it's ok to double aggressively and leave it in aggressively when it's 2minor, because if it makes it's not a disaster|pg||
nt|athene: but very different when 2 of a major of course|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: would have bid 2@h, though, and probably lost something approximating to 280|pg||
nt|nicksan: A standard 3 NT, or a very lucky 6 @D ?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: if west sees it though with 3@D i suppose they might get there|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you would have some sort of guess in 6@d, and you would probably follow the percentages and go down|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Did 1@S promise five diamonds?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Indeed, unless South leads it of course..|pg||
nt|dburn: that could happen, but with both opponents showing relatively balanced hands it could also not happen|pg||
nt|athene: if south doesn't lead a club, that increases the chance he has the ace, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mug: boils down to @HK onside plus either @CA or @HJ onside, depending on the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer might still make|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Since the @H King HAS to be onside, isn't it the same chance of finding the @c ace onside as the @h Jack, David?|pg||
nt|dburn: no - two cards are more likely to be in opposite hands than the same hand|pg||
nt|mug: now's the time for West to limit his hand with 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brass did make one slam try with 3@D, time to bid 3NT I think|pg||
nt|dburn: when South has @hK, that leaves one less space in his hand for @cA than in North's|pg||
nt|mug: he has a lot of secondary values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry Tom, you were faster|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mug: Roberts can't hold back now|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure when he's limited his hand - though I agree he has a good one|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: south knows the hearts aren't going to be an immediate and easy trick source for declarer, so no need to lead the @CA, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps 2NT showed more than 3NT would have done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can sign off in 5@D of course, but with all those controls I don't think he should. West's 4@H was an overbid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mug: they play 1430 so 5@C was one key card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: I still believe that if South doesn;t lead a Club, east may get it right...|pg||
nt|mug: now South knows @CK is on his right, so he won't lead those|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps a trump?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think the lack of club lead showing the ace outweighs the Vacant Places argument|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are bound to go down on a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you don't insert the 10|pg||
nt|mug: why Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or let it run|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: erez will lead a trump|pg||

nt|eugenio123: were they swopping? lol    at the end 10 tricks|pg||
nt|saverio: 4@s for NS here|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly it is just one of those magic hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  3@h must show  values and a super @d-fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he bid 1 nt, (2 suited presumably)  |pg||
nt|sybarra: that why I would be nervous |pg||
mb|1S|nt|eugenio123: 2@s show 5@h gf|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should have overcalled|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 10 tricks ye|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C should make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's hard to bid game|pg||
nt|sybarra: need great agreements for that bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: fit bid?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|possessed: both 5d and 3nt can be doomed|pg||

nt|chrisky: 3nt has np|pg||

nt|panosk: 3NT very gd score in open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: best lead is @h ,but you dont have any|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|loe48: this hand again is almost to good for a weak 2 opener, rather 1s-2s hand|pg||
nt|saverio: since they bid usually 1 or 2 tricks more it shouldnt be difficult for them to get there :)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: E could help them :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead would make it difficult and is marked.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: @H lead should have been interesting.|pg||
nt|panosk: dont be deaf in pards signals they are very helpfull some times :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  a not great 3N that makes when both majors (and @d) split nicelay And the !k is onside|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Normaly she would bid first round|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: wydaje mi sie troche za ostre 3@s Witkowskiego|pg||
nt|sybarra: E opened the hand it the other room |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the hungarian comentator at the open room feels ashamed i ve heard :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: she decided to trhow 7 @c |pg||

nt|daman: this seems like a routine contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: and it looks natural to lead @d from N in that bidding|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  seems like an easy game|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|redds: i rewolwerowe otwarcie Wojtka wybilo przeciwnikow z 4@S|pg||

pc|c9|nt|yuval10: but declarer will finesse the J@h and the @h's are 3-3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|timverbeek:  hard for east to decide|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  interesting lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: EW maybe push them to bid game|pg||
nt|eugenio123: finally they found their fit on 4th level|pg||
nt|antoniz: mieli realn¹ szansê na kontrakt 4pik,ale szalone 2karo zaprowadzi³o do 3NT|pg||
nt|raghavan: a good controlled pass by W|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: of course he might just cash four rounds of diamonds first to see what happens|pg||
nt|raghavan: under cut?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: he knows @h44 now if @h7 lead was 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: szalay is there |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|timverbeek:  now declarer is in big danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 9 was the winning play |pg||
nt|riccho:  sounded like him|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: they needed to double hook the @H to make    |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pinticus: no,seems 1off with best defence|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psyck: assuming he trusts opps|pg||
nt|loe48: 10 or 11 all depends on declearer choose to double finesse spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|antoniz: jestem:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that entry was worth it |pg||
pc|d2|nt|saverio: 1off requires a @c guess|pg||

nt|saverio: and a perfect timing|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|eugenio123: but very lucky , @d finesse could make her pay|pg||

pc|d7|nt|saverio: now can even be -3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|timverbeek:  so think I would help her|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: not sure about the A@h...N could very well had TXX @h|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  think low diamond is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze Piotrek, dobrze...ja o tym tr¹biê od wielu lat|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: After they bid three suits and opener bids notrump?|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these fourth suit auctions is you have to mix COG and slam auctions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 3@D then not a slammish hand?|pg||
nt|athene: and it causes all sorts of subtle difficulties|pg||
nt|dburn: could be played that way, certainly, but game before slam is sensible policy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David plays it differently|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: if you meant COG you have to bid 3NT or 5@D over 3@S|pg||

mb|2N|nt|sybarra: I hope he didnt think a)  3 sp forcing or b) pard could read his mind re 4 @H in his hand |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: The trick is to avoid the 5-level here. 5@H is in jeopardy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|athene: ok, so now we know 3@C is minimum, not singleton :)|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H asking for shortage perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Singleton spade is not good news for Erez|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and partnerhas shown a minimum already|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time to sign off|pg||
nt|athene: singleton club was the only thing that might excite south a bit|pg||
nt|mug: North could have the same hand with @HK extra could he not?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mug: in which case slam is almost cold|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: not for a minimum hand?|pg||
nt|mug: she I meant|pg||
nt|athene: with the @HK as well it would be a 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: too good to bid 3@C on|pg||
nt|mug: you're probably correct Bill|pg||
nt|athene: even if south gets ambitious, he will find he is missing two keys, and that will put an end to it|pg||
nt|mug: but there are probably other hands |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may still survive the 5-level, but it is no certainty|pg||
nt|nicksan: But the 5level is awfull high with the 5-1 break in CLubs|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mug: shouldn't be any reason to go past 4@H on these cards though, South has definitely overbid with 4NT|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mug: same mistake as Brass made earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: club lead and the defence can organize a club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer can throw spade on diamond?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After 3@S he can throw @SQJ out of the window, and he is also balanced. He should have signed off then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 4@C was an overbid|pg||
nt|mug: but having decided to make one cue-bid, that should have been the end of his effort|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence get the @SA in the bag first, east has no entry to deliver the ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: She can make becuase she gets a spade away on a diamond|pg||
nt|mug: if you really threw @SQJ out of the window you'd be saying what a good fit it was Roland, well worth a move|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||

nt|athene: now declarer can draw two rounds of trumps and just lead the @SQ and dummy is good|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|athene: rising @SA was a mistake i think - why would declarer rush to throw a spade if he had the king?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mug: @Sx @HKQxxx @DAxx @CKQxx is a good slam, are you telling me that's too strong for 3@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Counting to 11 is not that easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge blindness|pg||

nt|eugenio123: let's hope a normal auction and a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the Girls series they play 16 X 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: as oppose to the Juniors where they play one set of 20 boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: per match|pg||
nt|loe48: a 2 heart opener would have caused problems|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey Grozio :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: your countrymates need some support :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam for EW.|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room also,  they used 2 @H as negative bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 10 the other way!!|pg||
nt|riccho:  sry IÂ´m head shaking|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: that's of course a force because only 10 teams are playing in the girls'|pg||
nt|loe48: open 1h helped opponents to win 4s|pg||

nt|runnerup: 4 @h seems ok -just careful play needed |pg||
nt|sybarra: dropped down to 9.5 per bd|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: this hand may help if the French go too high|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, bd 11 is missing|pg||
nt|sybarra: would need valium for coaching here |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: Juniors has 22, Schools 18|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: @H|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: S juz to mogl wygrac przebijajac 2 kara ze stolu co postawiloby W w przymusie|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I suggest 2@h by south|pg||
mb|1N|nt|timverbeek:  two years ago there were more|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  pass on S was conservative|pg||
nt|cicus: seemed a push at 6x|pg||
nt|cicus: I guess 2@S is @S+x and 3@D inviting to @S|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d as multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: at least some play it that way|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe dbl by west|pg||
nt|eugenio123: no pls, pass isn't possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: right guess of @D and they can make 7.|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H another hasty bid|pg||
nt|panosk: since you have established a forcing game sequence 3@H is enough with this hand|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H shud be 7-8 cards in hearts, for me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the fearless 4 @H |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|gronkvist:  Opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tough play problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i can see the explanations:(|pg||
nt|cicus: however, 4@S has the obvious 4 losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1min thinking and then pass...|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: dosyc szczesliwa koncowka na trafieniu pika, co pewnie wyjasni sie w 1 lewie|pg||
nt|mareczek: hm... trzeba trafic do grona komentatorów, BBO ma taka grupê|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@C was more descriptive.|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make of course|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt double though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not find it so obvious|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not|pg||
nt|athene: let's say he plays low and it goes @h9 - jack|pg||
nt|cicus: although not if N holds up twice|pg||
nt|cicus: academic now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the explanation of 4@H was '' not sure '' :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witaj Marku|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and still is. 4@C.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W has powerhouse and EW hands match nicely with no wasted value.|pg||
nt|redds: 3@H wygra bez problemow, ciekawe jak poradzilby sobie z koncowka|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gronkvist:  Or W forgot|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So def camn take all tricks :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  "can|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: czy to Silna Grupa Pod Wezwaniem?|pg||

mb|5H|nt|rnmalik: and bidding 1@D has already shown weak hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: hi:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it didn't seem like they missed anything extra-ordinary here|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  now that is the last card I would play|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the @H3 lead has revealed the position|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would start working on my long suits|pg||
nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||

pc|dA|nt|eugenio123: when your opp bids in this way it is sure he's got good stoppers in majors|pg||
nt|riccho:  A10xx in @c ...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||
nt|athene: but fortunately for declarer east can't get in again to cash that @S10|pg||
nt|psyck: E cold have taken 2@d ruffs, not 9 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: declarer most likely will find the Q@d , after seeing AK @s A@c in South|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity for declarer that @S4 is so low|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|eugenio123: Q@h is a quite good lead, consider that the stopper will be at dummy, so by playing the Q can force the K and finesse the J of north ( if n had had the J )|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Conservative young man|pg||
nt|athene: it's fine to call a spade a spade, but you shouldn't call 2@S a spade as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must have seen her take-out doubles before|pg||
mb|d|an|support|nt|nicksan: Sorry, 1 @C is natural isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, the possibility that double is light doesn't really make 2@S less attractive|pg||

nt|nicksan: Double and lead a trump...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, west has an opening bid with 3 diamonds, which he has shown with his first two calls|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nicksan: good lead!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: I was referring to Erez' approach. Bid your hand to the limit on your first turn and you can pass with ease after that|pg||

nt|vugraphzjt: time for erez to go to toilet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Europe often gets more than six spots, as some federations in other zones can't afford to send a team|pg||
nt|mug: nicked a couple of IMPs for that, as one tends to do by declaring the hand at love all|pg||
nt|nicksan: E/W would have gained a trick had East ducked the first Spade, but South still made a great play by exiting with the ! queen from hand, keeping East off lead. |pg||

mb|p|nt|dzeronimo: brawo, na drugim stole doszli|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||

nt|Walddk2: all teams. But that is just my view|pg||

nt|nicksan: Looks almost impossible to stop now..likely to be flat unless West feels like doubling|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: slam was only likely if EW had 44 heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: seems like 5@S can be made here, declare in OR lost a trick somewhere|pg||
nt|vbman: this slam is a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be allowed only one push|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vbman: to stay in the match|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal looking @h game +1 if no acidents here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gronkvist:  So 1 1/2 match per day|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: flying into 4 @S?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panosk: i wonder what this 2@S might mean |pg||
nt|sybarra: good guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: guess now )?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|eugenio123: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|cicus: probably playing on @Ds, not @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: i didnt mean anything different than expected|pg||
nt|leao:  this doesn seem to be a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: easy 4 @h|pg||
nt|cicus: easily the best play|pg||
nt|cicus: to let @DQ run|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid that was not my guess |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh,  is he thinking 6 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: he is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might well see E try ak of clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E probably sighed with releif |pg||
nt|sybarra: *relief|pg||
nt|sybarra: IF the spade cashes |pg||
nt|riccho:  another big swing here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: if K of spade lead,  E shor|pg||
nt|sybarra: I stopped typing |pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we find that lead?|pg||
nt|leao:  off one with defence cashin out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|raghavan: looks like making 4 |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gronkvist:  Safety to finesse that way|pg||
pc|s8|nt|leao:  4@s, however, wud be many off :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: can EW help their country-mare's cause?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|cicus: it is suggested that this should be taken in dummy and a @H led - but what if N ducks smoothly?|pg||
nt|szalay:  call hr magican|pg||
nt|szalay:  her|pg||
nt|szalay:  and give her Hermione role in next chapter|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the @HK is not easy to duck although what will W hold to justify jumping to 3@H?|pg||
nt|szalay:  btw better to play Q: not so easy to duck|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||
nt|athene: west might have considered leaving 3nt with 4333 but his weak hearts perhaps were a worry|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure how good 3NT is with the natural @h lead|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: just a question of overtricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timverbeek:  another heart would give declarer problems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gronkvist:  to late |pg||
nt|rnmalik: needed passive defence, small @S.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: 3N would require dec to guess right which minor finesse to take|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to do given E hand with the aces I think |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Long trumps long suit lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we are watching "youngsters" |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree they are better players, I admit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|redds: ciezko powiedziec co znaczyla licytacja naszych, jakies pomysly ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panosk: thx to specs for their ideas but i wud expect it to be something like this competitve but not invitational|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: but he is on his way to it now|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||
nt|vbman: after 3sp south needs to bid 4cl, this is a bidders game|pg||

nt|nicksan: This has become uncomfortable now, he's not got the entries for the Heart finesse...but can exit in Diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now, with south sitting there with diamonds + @SQ|pg||
nt|mug: if you're not intending to split out the spades, no need to cash @SK, just cross to the ace|pg||

nt|athene: meckstroth in his book on the bermuda bowl has a hand almost exactly like that one|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: meckstroth NEVER has enough points for his 3nt bids|pg||

nt|athene: if you are worried about making mistakes in the play, that is more of a reason to declare rather than defend, though|pg||

nt|nicksan: i find them both pretty hard...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mug: spade to the queen seems a bit odd, isn't a spade to the ten correct to make three tricks if there's J-x or J-x-x onside?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|nicksan: Roberts has done well not to give declarer the @H jack here, wonder if they can beat it by 2...?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|henryb:  perhaps not - I was assuming E would lead the @dA|pg||
nt|psyck: @d punches will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  He will go down anyway on the @s lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's overcall is marginal, and it forced him to an uncomfotable bid in the 2nd round|pg||

nt|riccho:  3@h is a bit too much. If you play a WK NT style. Partner should expect a 15 HCP Hand BAL type with 2@h already. No need to raise the bidding more than that|pg||

nt|athene: for example let's say @DQ ruffed, spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might want to go @HA, @HJ, diamond ruff and now lead the @CK to keep east off lead, preparing entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: or you could rise @SA on the shift to block them|pg||
nt|nicksan: but after two rounds of trumps, all following, it's all over - the Diamonds are coming in. |pg||
