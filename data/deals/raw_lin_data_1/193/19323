pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  on this lead, 3NT is easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes -ew has 5 @h/east !!  and 5 @d will come -for down 1 -but perhaps 5 @h makes in practise by west also|pg||
nt|frankbo: yes|pg||
nt|kaapo: Italy 2nd after R15, as they have been for the most of the tournament. Finland now 16th|pg||

nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
nt|kaapo: A quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco might have promised stronger hand than this with his bidding, or might be just normal youngsters friskines on both parties|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they need a good win now if they want to chalenge Israel....good for moral as well|pg||

pc|s5|nt|famus: Denmark has been catapulting with great display of bridge understanding at this level--This is a very important match for them|pg||
nt|famus: I presume 3@ds was routine rev bergen|pg||
nt|zebutin: Sadly i don't know anything about italian pair, Kytömaa&Vallivaara are both students in university of Oulu|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|bmkl: same as in open tbl|pg||
nt|arigun: @s mecuber 1 tur daha boslayacak 10 love olacak|pg||
nt|stevedr: good defense for -1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good switch not giving declarer a chance to make:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
nt|rado: declarer might produce 9 tricks but brobably defence will be 1st with 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: E playing 1NT in the open room....|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we will start with a swing...|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand young superstar Madala is playing, who has played almost every round of the tournament|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand = other room|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||
nt|dkkello: Yes but still some work to do|pg||
nt|runnerup: a little suprice that ns didnt bid 5 @d|pg||

pc|hT|nt|frankbo: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, a bit passive|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of work for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: now declarer seems to have 2@D+2@S+3@C+@H eventually, and then opponents have setting trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be too much work :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ybob: now @H to discard later @D|pg||
nt|bagman: Kytömaa's opening was a bit on the light side considering the position and vulnerability but he's not going to be badly punished|pg||

nt|lady007: ok, next board. EW seem to have some chances in 4@h but probably wont get there|pg||

nt|rado: maybe after Smolen W might bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|stevedr: with good def this can go -6|pg||
nt|stevedr: but probably to hard again|pg||
mb|5C|nt|eleni: 4@h seems a great contract for B-S|pg||
nt|eleni: in spite of the bad break|pg||
nt|chrisky: buy unlucky|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers i think|pg||
nt|lady007: and now 3@h from gullberg? he does have a lot of queens and jacks, and partner has a passed hand, but you also dont want to give NS too much space in the bidding|pg||
nt|lady007: N has a difficult problem now, he has a nice hand but not a very good shape for a take out double|pg||
nt|liujing: this must be an important match|pg||
nt|liujing: 2nd(ITA) against 3rd(DEN)|pg||
nt|zebutin: something like that might give chance for it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and not does S wake up?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  S has an easy 6@h now?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eugenio123: it's hard ti lead @d|pg||

nt|frankbo: now 4 might makes|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: bye the way the result will be -1 , it's impossible to find the 7th trick|pg||

nt|kaapo: I hope it wasn't the Italian waitress who caused the outage - or if it was that at least she brought some good food :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as we don't exactly know what 3@S promises, it's not easy to tell who 'upgraded' - sure is 4@S has no play|pg||

nt|galois85: good afternoon everybody|pg||
nt|zebutin: on 1st deal they managed to climb only to 3@S, but made one trick less, so score is still even|pg||

nt|zebutin: and click on tbl number you want to know more about|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: ugly contract|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with a 5-loser hand, the problem is that partner might have enough for game for you if you bid a 2-suiter but wont know|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks rather a normal contract but maybe West could search for 5@D on the way|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lady007: the netherlands reached 5@s on the first board and seem to be making 480|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, he needs entry on table by ruffing @s, finesse the @h, later ruff @s again, finesse @c, and needs doubleton K to discard one @s|pg||
nt|lady007: i think 4@h always makes because trumps are 2-2, so you can ruff 2 spades in dummy, and discard the other on the clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he must make this, no doubt|pg||
nt|lady007: van den bos knows east has 55 in the majors and is now thinking if there is a way to set the contract. will declarer have JTxxx ATxxx xx A? or JTxxx ATxxx A xx?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|liraren: i am told that ew play 15-17 NT 5 card major and weak 2 , so natural bidding but i guess that they have a lot of gadgets :)|pg||

nt|gmarco24: ok, here comes one finesse|pg||

nt|zebutin: ending was interesting, could have played @H suit at the end and maybe have something good come up...|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems here is another 3nt, this time most likely making with 3@C+ 4@S+@D and 1-2 @H tricks...with @D lead might make even more diamond tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: he risked going down with @D KJ offside on this line, I think|pg||
nt|ritong: hello all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still, success is the cure for all evils|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Henri, hi|pg||
nt|liraren: natural weak 2@d|pg||
nt|ybob: X and over suit at low level, bids @D |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: most teams playing in 3N board 3 it seems|pg||
nt|runnerup: here nobody can make anything big -perhaps not even any little|pg||
nt|arigun: tablonun uzerinde istediginiz kategoriye tiklayip canli sonuclara bakabiliyorsunuz|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club with transfers for NS, right?|pg||
nt|antoniz: sorry -2|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in West already in 3nt....QD lead|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eleni: even 5 with a correct @d play:)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes an easy raise to game maybe via some gadget|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@h for N-S here|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C some Bergen raise ?|pg||
nt|tez: 5 de kalmýþ öbür masa:(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes  a lot of trf :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|_fonzie__:  good decision from east to pass|pg||
nt|dkkello: Bergen raise|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @h4+|pg||
nt|stevedr: 1nt = 11-14|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42:  probably they play 1@S = no 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then Dbl = 4+@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Not an easy bid for North now|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to bid 3@h, no?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@S is presumably forcing & with his pips he can afford to play opposite a singleton, so that may do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S is reasonable also|pg||
nt|eleni: Tis metadoseis tis imeras tis vlepoume sto http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/Bulletins.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: Missing all TOP honours , I would definitely hesitate to Open a weak two in first seat  |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  yes, especially vul|pg||
nt|liraren: and vuln!|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 3@h here, but EW have a lucky game on in 4@s|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe they will take the "save" in 4@s if NS bid 4@h|pg||
nt|famus: i think there surely was a case for @D red suit fin after @s have been cleared--cany make without that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden seems to have given up strong club and shifted to this system instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: any other would be non forcing|pg||
nt|liujing: a rountine 3NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes its the new swedish club ;)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eugenio123: I would've overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 3@s is NF then 3@H is compulsory|pg||
nt|ritong: a good point to discuss with your regular pard|pg||
nt|lady007: 2N showing an invitational heart raise or better|pg||
nt|ybob: p p X ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: whatever, south has to move|pg||
nt|ybob: pass works fine to collect 200|pg||
nt|ybob: and probably down 1 in 4m|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla will pass|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: wit|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass at all|pg||
nt|eleni: just Jacoby is enough here for Peter and Michael:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  which is good as long as you dont forget :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S = 3-card @S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42:  Petersen too passive here|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2nd chance :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I doubt South can manage to cue the @H singleton though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead from N? i might prefer passive @S|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D pictures most likely behind declarer, Jx doesn't look promising, and A10x isnt going anywhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: or thats my thinking on lead anyway :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|possessed: seems another flat board|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@D seem making|pg||
nt|possessed: N-S can not generate more then 5 tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||
nt|rado: French top player Alain Levy recommends to seek for Major lead when unbid Majors at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: interesting lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: Yet France is a bit ahead at the moment:) But results for all the agressive youngsters are fluctuating:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i bid X with S cards and go down|pg||
nt|dkkello: anyone for dbl  3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ybob: i pass|pg||
nt|arigun: defans bati tarafindan bir ara kucuk @c oynarsa sorunsuz bir batar|pg||
nt|tez: 3 @s yapýyorduk|pg||
nt|yusufb: kotu atak oldu|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  She knows that partner doesnt have extras and 3@h|pg||
nt|friggi: 1@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, I believe EW use 3rd/5th leads so @D2 is usually from 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
nt|tez: 11 puanla þlem daveti bile yapmadý..ortakta iyi bir 22 bile olmaz diye düþündü|pg||
nt|veistikke:  can always try to squeez it inn 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||
nt|eleni: yes and then smolen|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H you most likely hit partners major suit, but he can't have too much points when you have 10...|pg||
nt|zebutin: but could work out with some combinations|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: @h küçük çýkýlabilirdi|pg||

nt|zebutin: so @D honor lead in other room and small @D here, no love for majors :(|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested @D 9 continuation|pg||

nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he should see that cl was not good there|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they need to right the ship |pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe beginning|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
nt|zebutin: but then J could cover, if singelton honor takes it 654 against H3 is enough|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: nothing fancy in the end: declarer likely to make his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|runnerup: to play @c was like surrender here i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tez: doðu sýkýþacak|pg||

nt|tez: iyi oluyor boyle cengiz..seyirciler mutlu oluyor biz bilemeyince:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I also play like that. Trouble with the method is that with 4-4 in the majors it's easy to lose the @S fit, especially if opponents interfere like this|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||
nt|ahri:  north didn't have a problem as south returned high heart to show spades|pg||

nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might end in 3NT here; down with a spade lead and make if declarer can get 9th trick from diamonds in time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||

nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||

nt|rado: strange to buy contract at 2@D at other room|pg||

nt|pinticus: 2nt=min no 4@h|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for france|pg||
nt|zebutin: needs to quess @H right to have any chance at this... when J or Q drops its much better odz that  Rubino has other honor...but then you are always losing 1 @H trick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer plays low and there's no good move for W|pg||
nt|jkotor: ta jest panie komendancie !|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: When was the Häxan convention invented, Johan, do you know?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Was it before or after Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if defence would have started with 3 @D rounds, then 5 @H tricks would maybe have been enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: EW  have done their job   hopefully their teammates can do theirs|pg||

nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||

nt|bagman: Then he would have 9 tricks without relying on clubs|pg||
nt|stevedr: my god|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vasmar: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello: This wont take long , though Niclas Ege is a very carefull player ( slow) :)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|kaapo: He's probably questioning very carefully about EW's lead methods|pg||
pc|c4|nt|possessed: a deserved 11 imp|pg||

nt|galois85: I don't know that convention, any reference online?|pg||
nt|kaapo: While Gazzilli shows either clubs or a strong hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|pinticus: for EW|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  tricky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: imo, the upside of the fijumps is the fast knowledge of double fits, in case opponents resist, plus some perfecto slams now and then|pg||

nt|runnerup: 3 @c tricks needed in this so small to QJxx-to avoid later quess in that suit here|pg||
nt|frankbo: need to find 9 in cl to makes this i thk|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested passing 1@S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||

nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe he wants to make it harder for EW to balance|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  is similar to the prev. hand by her (probably) sister|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h doesnt look like a very good contract|pg||
nt|offthebend: North does not really have any convenient bid over the T/O dbl -- so pass will be ok but stretched to a RDBL  |pg||
nt|liraren: when i bid TO with west hand my pd always bid 3@c |pg||
nt|lady007: this looks like 4@s by NS|pg||

nt|runnerup: 3nt should have been -1 -5 @c can be made with qoublefiness in @h -this was a big bid -good or bad -i dont know|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS may be able to jam the bidding a bit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Looks normal to reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe West can suggest 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks also normal to go down in 4@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: @Ds are foul so no direct 9 tricks at NT either|pg||
nt|zebutin: knows partner had short spades, so @S K seems like wasted value on this auction|pg||

nt|bebechira: Netherland scored 10 IMPS on the 5cx-1 vs 4h+1|pg||

nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|kaapo: Again, 1@D is shoing 4+@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W might sacrefise in 4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to land in 4 @H here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes , Dennis BIlde shifted to a @C in open room in trick 2 , made it "easy" , but 3x @H |pg||
nt|yusufb: iyi atak yaptý|pg||
nt|zebutin: this was maybe little unexpected development|pg||
nt|kaapo: This may not be a good way to do it, either|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: right, but a @c has to be given early to opps|pg||

nt|drserhan: 10 takým var|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h now will close the proceedings i think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vasmar: 4@H is a better contract but no way to reach it|pg||
nt|ybob: no if it, declares play AK @S and run @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: and win too|pg||
nt|frankbo: great score for sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: probably 2@d is a relay|pg||
nt|ahri:  12 tricks outside clubs (doubledummy)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its ok for 10 though..|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if 3 rounds in @h , declarer trump , play AK @s then @d no ? |pg||
nt|ybob: no way to defeat|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sac? |pg||
nt|sybarra: need more that guts |pg||
nt|andreasw:  depends on what dbl shows.. if it shows suit and lead or just lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||
nt|key1809: but all roads lead to Rome|pg||
nt|rocketer: hello ...2@D is GF ...2@H said had 4@H without 3@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  east believes he has a trick.|pg||
nt|eleni: a peculiar bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: most of us would believe the same :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: only if W overcalls in @D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Wd bye E here|pg||
nt|kaapo: At the other table Madala passed as South over the double, and West's 1@D didn't show any values|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here west was able to show something by doubling 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The Danish declarer went 2 down in 6@D|pg||
nt|zebutin: in @H is missing 2 aces/5, so will not be bidding slam in that|pg||

pc|s6|nt|dkkello: true 10 tricks|pg||

pc|h6|nt|eugenio123: well done north|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
nt|yusufb: fazla anlaþmalarý yok olanlar bile buralarda fire verirken|pg||
mb|3S|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
nt|arigun: @DAK baslarsa defan durum sakat tabii|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edirse..ki edilir ..sonrasýný iyi ayarlamak lazým|pg||
nt|stevedr: altough i would be tempted to double with the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
nt|famus: first sign of  cheer for Danish fans with Italy going down in 4@S-- the declarer there lost trump control on a @H lead--he played !A and back-Danish yougster--took both @S and ...|pg||
nt|famus: forced a @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||
nt|liujing: and play @C AK|pg||
nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobry wist na -1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kaapo: EW play mini NT when vulnerable so West has max 9 HCP|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good stop:)|pg||
nt|stevedr: winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|stevedr: they need to hear, good stop, wins 15 :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||
nt|tez: defans en zor yeri briçin..en zevklisi ayný zamanda|pg||
nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make this for a 5 IMP gain for Finland|pg||
nt|veistikke:  haha|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yusufb: sacma bi iþ yaptý|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
pc|dT|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
nt|kaapo: Especially after this switch|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
nt|friggi: not the best switch|pg||
nt|stevedr: probably still push with h return|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be - 2 yes. a draw :P |pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||
nt|bagman: good time for espresso :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||

nt|vasmar: freak hand by North|pg||
nt|offthebend: hand for 6C |pg||
nt|offthebend: hope they at least get to some game |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  9 tables already played this hand, nobody (understandably) in 6@c|pg||
nt|liraren: i can´t imagine any bidding too 6@c so hope for game|pg||
nt|lady007: over 2@s, north will surely bid 2N and he might raise to 3 then|pg||
nt|timve:  well you can bid 2@S, but will you pass 2NT by partner? knowing you probably have a heartfit|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri:  quite distributive set this is|pg||
nt|pinticus: only 1 round today for juniors|pg||

nt|offthebend: 5C is much better than 3NT |pg||
nt|friggi: Det kan godt være men vi skal snakke engelsk, skal vi ikke?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: 12+12 BAL is often a game|pg||
nt|kaapo: However with @Cs 3-3 and hearts as they are, declarer might come to 9 at NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chrisky: a slam in @H or @C for ew|pg||

nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|liraren: what about light overcall , count the hcp in east :)|pg||
nt|lady007: no you will have to force to game then, but 3@h sounds more like a 5+card suit and less HCP|pg||
nt|lady007: partscore battle here|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 3nt de|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt küçükler @c @h yani|pg||

mb|3C|nt|pinticus: aggressive 1@h|pg||

nt|cicus: unfriendly lie of cards for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|lady007: EW make 2@H (3 without the spade ruff) and NS can make 3D (4 without the club ruff)|pg||
nt|timve:  but the spadelead seems normal, the clublead doesnt|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@c ye pas düsünülemez bile|pg||

nt|mamos: wrong again  forgot to allow for NS lol|pg||
nt|eleni: nah Mike! Michaels coid in @d asks for a slam|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s bid made the bidding even easier|pg||
nt|eleni: void I meant:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@H much, much more :)|pg||
nt|pinticus: X by E shows strong hand,3@d shows limit 5@h4@s|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  two keycards missing here|pg||
nt|vasmar: double is dangerous|pg||
nt|offthebend: but does he gain anything out of it ?:)|pg||
nt|liraren: south X is transfer to @s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  tough call for north now, it's probably not clear that 3@c would be forcing|pg||
nt|dkkello: not my style |pg||
nt|arigun: 3nt ye kamaz zannetmem en azinda 4@h -2 iyi baraj|pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: (sorry everyone for my typing:) I never qualified as a secretary:):))|pg||
nt|mamos: well done fellow commentators and Greek EW  (though I think French NS helped a bit :))|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ponaglaj¹ mnie do komentarza...co tu gadaæ - wszystko jasne|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  +50 was still worth 5 imps for Germany|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but may be caused a problem, this may head for 3N|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can access live scores by clicking on either JUNIORS or YOUNGSTERS|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nah, Italians usually have some fancy stuff, so this may only appear natural|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead is good start for defence|pg||
nt|stevedr: 3clubs shows 4s and 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: no idea|pg||
nt|tez: 3@s diyecek ve onu oynayacaklar|pg||
nt|tez: tam olacak 3@s ..@h dam ataðýýndan sonra|pg||
nt|ahri:  diamonds behaving, heart ten dropping early|pg||

nt|pinticus: 5@h4@d*|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czego siê czepiacie jednej lewki...to tak jak ze stowy wydawaæ grosza reszty|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  good call, he knows @c king onside and just hopes for an entry in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: but he may need two entries if Kxx of Club is with W and S has to have at least 2 cards in Clubs |pg||
nt|gmarco24: this guys are bidding like there's no tomorrow|pg||
nt|juan lukas: the 2@h opening helps EW to bid 5@d |pg||
nt|dkkello: 2 C!  maybe artificiel? dont know|pg||
nt|ybob: probably Gazzilli|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D alerted ?|pg||
nt|runnerup: he bid 4 @d here also -perhaps some 5-5 showing bid ..-this will loose in practice|pg||
nt|arigun: ama ondan sonra 3nt  nasil desinki tek @h le bati|pg||

nt|juan lukas: X for the @s lead |pg||
nt|dkkello: i was told from reliabel sources 2 @C is natural |pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
nt|famus: duck|pg||
nt|liujing: a good lead but a bad duck here|pg||
nt|famus: shud b careful not to release @hA|pg||
nt|galois85: yes 3@c asking major. What would you lead in N?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see 6 tricks; AQ of hearts onside does not help; he needs to set up the clubs and prevent EW from cashing 2 spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  points for N/s now |pg||

nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C stand out inmy view|pg||
nt|ritong: one more time, the fact that pard is a passed hand is a factor  way less chances to have 3 NT cold|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||
nt|famus: so the Danes have managed to recover from the earlier shock|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cicus: ah this must be an agreement I am seeing for the first time|pg||

mb|p|nt|timve:  well would you have bid 5@D with south?|pg||
nt|timve:  or would you have doublet|pg||
nt|timve:  doubled|pg||
nt|timve:  with A and K in the other suits|pg||
nt|lady007: i've seen Van Lankveld overcall on much weaker hands than this one, maybe the vulnerability scared him|pg||
nt|timve:  I think you can make a case for double|pg||
nt|lady007: yes i think so too|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S trafny.. Czy poprawny w tradycyjnym, francuskim stylu?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|liraren: i am told that 5 @h in open room was 3 down|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  4@h looks makeable (2 hearts and a club loser)|pg||
nt|liraren: but then u have to start with the @c Q |pg||
nt|liujing: sure, they catch up a lot|pg||
nt|friggi: Sweden is kicking back|pg||
nt|bagman: 11 more boards to come; unlikely that they would be 0-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table bidding was at 4@S before got to bid again after x with Di Francos cards...so they went to 5@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: Finland is having a hard day: The morning match was against France, then Israel and now Italy|pg||

nt|mamos: 6NT maybe even|pg||
nt|ritong: impatient to know what it is  a @c ask?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe a @D transfer?|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to play quite badly to go down 3 in 5H -- but it usually happens when you realise that contract is going down and you go extra down |pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt depence on lead -if @s -down but if you lead @h K-it makes -this has no future|pg||
nt|frankbo: new imps for sweden|pg||
nt|yusufb: beklenmedik biþey dedi ne acaba|pg||
nt|friggi: correct|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sweden currently 8th with 244, needing 28 to catch up with France in 3rd place. If memory serves, 5 qualify for the world champs, Sweden is 20 VPs behind that|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: even if I don't agree with the jump 4@h, I would've bid just 2 @h|pg||

pc|h5|nt|key1809: yes, it seemed 4H, was a stretch, but thats youth for u:)|pg||
nt|famus: The declarer mistimed his @D ruff in the last board--he shud ruff@D first and then return with @Hs--this can be a potential swing to Danes|pg||
nt|zebutin: this seems like nice pick up for finland|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose Antti in the open room tried to prove he's a man by leaping to 4@S :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahri:  first one of the match :(|pg||

nt|drkvas: sry|pg||
nt|liraren: i have learned the hard way that pd NEVER have the perfect cards :) so nowdays i dont hope for it |pg||
nt|offthebend: double dummy , if Clubs can be played for one loser , 5H will go only one down |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: K is onside but too many critical spots |pg||
nt|liraren: y i mean Kx onside|pg||
nt|offthebend: You can try and PIN 109 of clubs offside and K75 onside |pg||

nt|tejjyid: I think 5@D goes down "zero dummy"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: he will make a lot of tricks|pg||

mb|1H|nt|eugenio123: like all juniors would|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: yes, decent 5card suit, with 14, 1NT it is|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a hard on NS |pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks normal here|pg||
nt|cicus: all of us would Stayman and invite, can't afford to lose a major suit game|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 Bal or strw @c,@h or @s|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D now or are there options?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|eleni: welcome with us Konstantine:):)|pg||
nt|timve:  well if they lead a heart|pg||
nt|yusufb: slem oynicaklar|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *one|pg||
nt|offthebend: so 3 more imps to Denmark - in that case  |pg||
nt|liraren: y 12-22|pg||
nt|juan lukas: agressive 2@h and 4@h |pg||
nt|ybob: they are juniors :)|pg||
nt|tez: 12 puanla reverse yapýyor|pg||
nt|tez: çok ilerletmiþ|pg||
nt|yusufb: south stil olarak 2 konuþmasýnda 2@s diyo|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT on a @H lead!!|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@h is 4+@s|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H setting trump?|pg||
nt|bagman: this looks like a partscore in spades for 140|pg||
nt|kaapo: Aimala bid 4@S on this one too|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table bidding was 1@S-2@S-4@S on this, so they managed to get to fullgame|pg||
nt|sybarra: guys I have a lunch meeting I must go to,  thx all  |pg||
nt|veistikke:  Cya :) Good luck =) |pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42:  2@H apparently Kokish|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  showing @H or big NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: agressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so she could bid that to|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||
nt|timve:  you can pitch a club on the fourth diamond|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿le siê wydaje, po treflowym przebijamy pika, a potem oddajemy pika, przy atutach 22 nic nie mo¿na zrobiæ rozgrywakowi|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Ty for joining =)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Big Thanks to Sybarra|pg||
nt|sybarra: bye all |pg||
nt|andreasw:  4/5@S should be flat|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eugenio123: it seems hard to respect|pg||
nt|lady007: true|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d baþlamasý dogru|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak, masz racjê|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: 7 tricks, but East will face problems on pithces when north cashes clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was ose 30HP.|pg||
nt|chrisky: it has some problems on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||
nt|timve:  but I guess they wont bid 6|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
nt|kaapo: How about 3NT? Denying a decent heart fit, or some kind of serious slam try?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is either trf w @h or trf to Nt|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the point is you can use stayman as well with 5+@s, inviting values and any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: indeed|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d baþlamasý gerekiyordu bence|pg||
nt|tez: ben ayrýlmak zorundayým..hoþçakalýn|pg||
nt|yusufb: byeee tezcan|pg||
nt|famus: but shud land in a @s partial--ah-uh--some imps back|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: south had extras so took one more|pg||
nt|ybob: agressive to bid not to punish !!|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is a bit too high|pg||
nt|tez: önce majör deðil..güç varsa önce uzun|pg||
nt|galois85: now 4@d  6@h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla thoughts that she has shown some values here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps via RKC to 6@H|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose a spade, a club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the hearts on the @DK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in W in 6NT already|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding 1NT istead of 2@S looks good, though probably they'd stop at 3 even if he raised|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 6 @s aint. some points for N/s if they get to 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: you never know.... if there is no tomorrow ;-)|pg||
nt|tez: heyecanlandým þimdi|pg||
nt|tez: koz ne bilen var mý?|pg||
nt|arigun: @d @d @d :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 nt oynanýyor diðer masada|pg||
nt|yusufb: 4nt ye 7@d patlat gitsin|pg||
nt|famus: 5 back to italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
nt|bagman: If N makes a help suit try in hearts, S has a very bad hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c oynatma bizi cengiz|pg||
nt|tez: yoruldum oluyor mu diye bakmaktan:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no idear if it is @sK that is missing and missing 2 aces with 8 cards fit and getting to slam would be very bad bridge:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S might be kick back|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if can show shortness in diamonds and invite that way, not much better then|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
nt|kaapo: In that case 5@C shows 1 or 4 keys... but maybe they weren't on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: must be the case|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||
nt|tez: daha az yorardý|pg||
nt|arigun: seneye bize bi ekmek varmi tezcan bak bildim, gerci 2 sn olmadi ama :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin diyemedide eren dedi |pg||
nt|yusufb: madem 7 dicektin de niye 6@c dersinki|pg||
nt|arigun: masada 6@c hesitasyon varsa masaya ozel kuvvet gelebilir|pg||
nt|arigun: yani 6@c-6@d derken|pg||
nt|tez: 2/3 saniye düþünemeyecek miyim der selin|pg||
nt|arigun: perde de hesitasyon 20+ saniye kabul ediliyor bildigim adariyla|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So both player here thinks that they showed sometthing extras but partner didnt understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: Also facing a short suit trial in diamonds, S hand is not good for raise|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||
nt|tez: perdeli oynanýyor maçlar..dolayýsýyla direktörler çok prim vermiyor ona|pg||
nt|kaapo: Somewhat strange as 4@D really looks like the ace to North|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||
nt|tez: @h un birini yere çaktýrmak yeterli bu elde|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp gelecek|pg||
nt|tez: 10|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahri:  hoping for partner's king to be black|pg||
nt|offthebend: undo |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42:  5@H no, 6@H bugger|pg||
nt|offthebend: that H discard can be costly :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|ahri:  as he cannot have much more|pg||
nt|eleni: Konstantine is serving his military service in Cyprus:):) This is why he is not playing in this European Championship:)|pg||
nt|lady007: might make now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  the only problem with the sequence is how does W know about slam interest|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe pd was short in @S ...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless ofcourse behinds a million imps and alot of imps needed:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Gerben42:  I think the correct response to 4@C is 5@H lackwood (pd I dont have @D cue but slam interest)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: oh yes   you are right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats more like it|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s Q kuzeyde biliyo|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|key1809: North shd have hopped up, with the Ace and cleared clubs, |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The problem here that 3@h doesnt show a superhand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: a little break now|pg||
nt|chrisky: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|offthebend: now it is makeable |pg||
nt|timve:  btw Marion|pg||
nt|lady007: sorry, have to say: will make now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: @s partajýna oynarsa olur ..@s empas yaparsa olur..bi tek @c ekspasýna oynarsa batar|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding at the other table seems quite inconsistent with what we've seen from the pair before|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bebechira: 12?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42:  so lucky for Sweden that @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  otherwise would be 14 out|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now only 1|pg||
nt|timve:  this is the second match these two pairs play|pg||
nt|timve:  Helmich Hop seem out|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yusufb: hesitasyon:geç deklere vermek, beklemek, tereddüt etmek|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps North didn't realize the opening was from 3rd hand and took 2@S as a constructive raise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|veistikke:  1 imp for sweden|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|offthebend: throw West in with last D and get last two clubs after cashin S and Heart to the K |pg||
nt|timve:  do you have more info about that?|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe only for the moment|pg||
nt|lady007: no|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't see that west can x 4 hearts, and for all E knows west may be just spades..|pg||
nt|ybob: X  KJXX  AJXXXX  AX, W X 4@H too shows good hand with @S not penalty|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think north could may be have doubled 4 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  after being demolished by the two huge favorites, Eggeling - Brinck have a strong performance here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes but remeber that "1d here was @h or trf to NT|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dkkello: an even 6 @C is worth 2 imps!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, on to the next board. 2@C auctions can be tricky but luckily they are quite rare :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: East's Diamond exit was deadly accurate here|pg||
nt|mamos: It was a flat board 4@s -2 v 6@s -2|pg||
nt|cicus: but it could not go away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6 on a hook....or a pin|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Wich partscore to see?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  2@H in the other room at this point was a bit wet|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  and 6th @H|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he opts for a more noisy solution|pg||
nt|eleni: lololololo, yes too old in your early 20s:):)|pg||
nt|liraren: its not easy being operator , i am sure u do ur best :)|pg||
nt|timve:  I will bid 4@D with the easthand|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  so another chance for Germany|pg||
nt|timve:  transfer to spades not sleminvitational|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe that means something different for this EW pair|pg||
nt|timve:  dont want my opponents get the chance to intervene|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Seems enough by 3@D. Who knowes?|pg||
nt|ahri:  we started so well, with all boards providing some imps, let's hope we are done with pushes. It's junior bridge after all :)|pg||
nt|cicus: ok, I checked the movie|pg||
nt|ybob: good bid 3@S by E|pg||
nt|tez: masaya geçen el için direktör çaðrýlmýþ|pg||

nt|andreasw:  another board missing an ace and trumf K:) bid away guys;)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eugenio123: 2nt is not enough!|pg||
nt|key1809: N-S can make 3nt here|pg||
nt|lady007: I'm sure he isnt planning not to bid game :)|pg||
nt|dkkello: 2@D=limit+ or better raise of clubs , 3 @S shows stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the auction in OR looks strange to me, what can the 3 spade bid have meant?|pg||
nt|ybob: and GF|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@S on OR maybe shows m´s and short in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello: or will maybe  be an advance cuebid in a second when he bid 4 @C ?|pg||
nt|famus: probably asking for WHERE is help from E--wonder?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Might be another chance|pg||
nt|zebutin: at other table seems bidding has stopped at 2@Sx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eleni: hey boy! wait a few more years till you get middle aged:) Then years run fast:)|pg||
nt|famus: was this 2NT alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: no|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|zlatan: i played 3 times in this kind of championships, and as they say: "once a junior, always a junior"|pg||
nt|liraren: NS outbid again, |pg||
nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||
nt|dkkello: no :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely 3 spades in other room was a singleton heart as suggested by 2 specs|pg||
nt|ybob: and 9 + cards m´s |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if it does show clubs why not play in them?|pg||
nt|dkkello: what to lead? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: any @d works |pg||
nt|yusufb: her ne olursa olsun bu elle 2@s acmak cok kotu|pg||
nt|bagman: GIB can get 1100 but often defense drops a trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eugenio123: but south should've bid 3nt, not north|pg||
nt|key1809: North shd accept, he's a passed hand, and has Max for his pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: Celik have told his hand well.|pg||
nt|ahri:  east showing concern about clubs|pg||
nt|dkkello: oops|pg||
nt|famus: if not alerted--then a gen game try|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|key1809: H lead wd have given declarer some thought, now it will be a claimer |pg||
nt|timve:  well they succeed getting it in the easthand|pg||
nt|yusufb: diger odada acýlmýþ|pg||
nt|famus: if he manages to ruff the 4th @D with @H he wud be home, wud have to manage this|pg||
nt|famus: @h9|pg||
nt|famus: now a @H is best|pg||
nt|famus: which Madala I'm sure wud work out|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lady007: actually the best game is 3NT, but this will also make with the diamond finesse onside|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|eleni: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|key1809: generally, its not right to lead from an Ace, witha 4card suit, esp in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahri:  well bid. everything lies well on tihs board too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: indeed why not play in clubs here...6 clubs looks the same play as 3N on the non diamond lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|timve:  hard to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||

nt|chrisky: an slam in the minors for ew|pg||
nt|ritong: be careful with 5332!|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  5@d as reached in the other room is the normal contract, and it is normal to go down one by finessing the diamonds|pg||

nt|yusufb: eren dikkat ettim elinde 9 puan olmadan konuþmuyor|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In open room did EW plays min nt 9-12HCP and thats why E easily could bid 1@s and not be worry to miss something|pg||
nt|kaapo: Anyhow, here we seem to have a perfectly natural 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H looks like a transfer to spades, maybe invite or better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wrong colours |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol..yea|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s out here is standard.. |pg||

nt|tejjyid: thx|pg||
nt|cicus: why was 1@H alerted?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahri:  this is 21:9 for croats now if i am not mistaken, being on the "good" side of the VP scale for croats.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjn: he said can be with 3 cards|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu pasýda kabul edilemez|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here 1D always unbal|pg||
nt|kaapo: With a weak hand 2@S is available|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H probably in multi-landy context showing a good overcall (my guess)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pinticus: 7@s doesn't make last hand,only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: kontr deyip yaptýrsa mýydý?|pg||

mb|p|nt|key1809: oh ,clubs are not breaking|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other boring NT? Can miss it if @S lead from S|pg||

nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||
nt|mamos: I think he should have started with @d   and then bid 6@c the next round|pg||
nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||
nt|famus: looks hopeless|pg||
nt|liujing: but not easy to stop with 25HCP|pg||
nt|famus: but for @s pips|pg||
nt|lechcold: dobra obrona w wykonani Francuzów|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's not as easy as it seems|pg||

nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|famus: restricted choices of lead produces the best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|frankbo: seems like he need one D trick to make|pg||
nt|famus: @d10 might produce the setting trick|pg||
nt|famus: from the bidding N wud soon work out Declarer's sing @D|pg||
nt|famus: as the play progresses and has to remain vigilant|pg||
nt|vasmar: stis 20 ta 78 imps einai 25-1|pg||
nt|kaapo: I haven't got or seen EW's notes on agreements so don't know for sure but quite likely|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can draw trumps, play a heart up and then set the diamonds (or diamonds first and heart then)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yusufb: partskora kolay kolay X demez zeynep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he had bid 4@D the first time, then partner will move on when that is correct ... and partner can also move on with 4@S on a 4-card suit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  both have showed their hands :) no more to say|pg||
pc|s3|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||

nt|bebechira: i was just typing ..what happened to 6d|pg||
nt|goss: yes 6@d is making but hard to reach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The way to get to 6@D is for South to re-open with 5@D, and North to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|lechcold: problem w tym, ¿e WJ nie przewiduje ¿adnego rebidu z t¹ kart¹:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I honestly think that 3NT was the better percentage choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But this is what we need :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Double would be nice though ;)|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart lead and ducked|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba wola³bym 2@C, wskazuj¹c 5+trefli i 15+PC|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I guess some of them wont sleep that good tonight :P|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||
nt|zlatan: if he was about to bid grand he would bid 7@d immediately|pg||
nt|yusufb: yaptýrcaklar inþallah yanýlýrým|pg||
nt|andreasw:  naaah:) after playing alot of bridge you will allways sleep good:)(unless you went down in 7nt with 18 top tricks!);)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  this round all close results so far, even Poland - Bulgaria|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I did once ;)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahri:  overtricks time for france|pg||
nt|pinticus: at 14,madala playing 6@s|pg||
nt|famus: bingo--trump lead best for defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: jeli 3@C by³o naturalne, to licytacja Jassema wskazuje dobry fit treflowy i obawe o kara - Tuczyñski powinien pójæ zdecydowanie do przodu|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: and this may be the right contract whatever the OR result|pg||
nt|runnerup: 10 off @d save this home even with @h lead-also @s 3-3 -and overtrick makeable now|pg||
nt|eleni: Now Pierre needs to attack @s and ruff twice, while he still has entry to his hand with @dA|pg||
nt|ni hao: a pretty bloody match-lots of imps:)|pg||
nt|famus: there u go|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: with this lie, has to continue to have a chance to take a trump trick|pg||
nt|yusufb: ernin eli 2@h pas demezdi|pg||
nt|lechcold: i tak zrobi³:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|zlatan: thats why i said 5nt as a try|pg||
pc|s8|nt|famus: there wud b a final black suit squeeze and throw in perhaps|pg||
nt|famus: big swing to italy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: a spot-on remark from a kib: maybe W should have overtaken?|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  if it's showing @s +@c in swedish style (thanks ukdorj) then it makes more sense to me|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|key1809: when u have an option, it cant be the only one:)|pg||
nt|bagman: A better plan would have been to cash another heart and pitch the @DA|pg||
nt|bagman: now that would have failed as the diamonds are 4-1|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andreasw:  7*slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: hi|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: it does not matter much as W's trumps could have been coup-ed|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|zebutin: this works too|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe :P |pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: yeh corrected not a BIG swing since -200==so translates to 6IMPs to Italy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: this actually works much better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: but that would not have gone without risk|pg||

nt|ntmon: another slam hand|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@s or 6nt for EW here|pg||
nt|eleni: a thrilling match anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: mistery:)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance for France here perhaps|pg||
nt|zebutin: N/S have some cards again|pg||
nt|bagman: NS slam in hearts (or probably in clubs and NT too)|pg||
nt|bagman: NT and clubs from N|pg||
nt|bagman: hard to bid, easy to make|pg||
nt|goss: i agree with you|pg||
nt|goss: in pairs it would be obvious; in teams, we could also double and on clubs bidded by pd, bid diamonds|pg||
nt|lechcold: Jassem móg³ otworzyæ tak¿e 1@D, ale wybra³ (s³usznie) 1@C. Kar przeciez tak naprawdê nie mia³...|pg||
nt|veistikke:  Once I was inn 7 D with 23 points. My "partner" had 6 of them, and he was the 1 bidding it :P|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mamos: not much for anyone here|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i have to leave guys, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@s is 5@s and 4+minor, weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  3@C with south or pass?|pg||
mb|d|nt|chrisky: 1 nt for ns|pg||
nt|ntmon: or 6@D for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they super raise with balanced hands|pg||
nt|lady007: 3@c is pass/correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i hope it s not 2NT " almost forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: in the same time Italy, my team, is winning 42/18  |pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@c is min|pg||
nt|goss: but then you need to have discussed the auction with pd : 3S p p X p 5C p 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||
nt|ahri:  operator: did north upgrade or is it 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 3 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: though|pg||
nt|famus: 4-1 trump break again we see|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Specs. S can not bid 3@H now. Game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he upgrated to 15|pg||
nt|chrisky: or 2@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: but agree, @S fit is at hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I must say I like to play 2NT NF|pg||
nt|zlatan: typical 1nt opening after a bad board :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they managed to bid 4@S at other table too on 15, so most likely same score|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H to prawdopodobnie dwukolorówka:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|goss: here Robert is showing 5-5 with little hope for slam|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pinticus: Italy gains 3MPs,Madala plays 6@s+1 on 14(@d lead)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT promising 4-card support I hope :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes and inv+|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
nt|goss: otherwise, he wd bid 4@d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: 4@D directly over 1NT?|pg||
nt|goss: yes french standard|pg||
nt|goss: showing 5-5 majors, game level|pg||
nt|8252: non parla l'italiano qui ? |pg||
nt|goss: si si :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think this convention is the most common in sweden after 4 NT blackwood|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
nt|bagman: if 2@S was FG, S had time to listen to a reaction from N with 3@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The youngsters are required to play French Standard, are they?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|famus: wud go down in 5@s ass well|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahri:  good switch|pg||
nt|eleni: yet pls gfollow the final scores on the sute of the Youth's European Champioship:) as they chanfe ar every board:)|pg||
nt|pinticus: a bit too shy E here|pg||
nt|lady007: yes but can he set up the spades then?|pg||
nt|juan lukas: on a @d lead, declarer has to pick up the Q@s |pg||
nt|andreasw:  just duck @c A 3 times how can make?|pg||
nt|veistikke:  W have to play @s|pg||

pc|hT|nt|chrisky: tha mporw..|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timve:  if he went for it yes|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe it would have worked better for east to return a low heart, so west can play another round of trumps|pg||
nt|timve:  yep|pg||
nt|ybob: S showed AQ @D now|pg||
nt|famus: i think instead of 4nt e wud've done well had he cue bid in @Cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H probably shows some extras as with a weaker hand South might jump to 4@H over 2@C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don;t like 4@C becasue it's hard to get back to 3NT|pg||
nt|goss: no they aren't but i quite know those ones|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: Just look at the site, after the end of each round |pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think that West's duck of @DA was all that wise|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahri:  cash&carry for croats now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Give the children a shower. I will brb|pg||

nt|lady007: 5@c by EW looks like it has some chances, and 3N as well maybe|pg||
nt|timve:  they both seem to make with all the finesses on|pg||
nt|dkkello: On running score board 14 is wrong |pg||

nt|lady007: but difficult hand to bid|pg||

pc|d4|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS in trouble in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: why?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E opens 2@d multi|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah right, some East's might venture an opening|pg||
nt|goss: 5@c showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Asks for trump queen|pg||
nt|goss: should bid 6@d now|pg||
nt|goss: to show Q of trumps and K@d|pg||
nt|rado: and 6@S easy ruffing 3@C ( precious 8@s)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Agustin in 6d in brd 16|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
nt|famus: that wud set it|pg||
nt|bebechira: after Agustin dbled the 3s preemt|pg||
nt|goss: on which auction ?|pg||
nt|goss: ok|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @d bye |pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D there so really a trouble|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will play @D AK and @D and play for a @S houner in place|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Wasn't W free to bid 4@D at the road?. My way always.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hehe|pg||
nt|famus: -2 even if madala tries to make|pg||
nt|famus: a duck here wud have been a double dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 6NT is the slam to be in|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3s p pd-4nt-6d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eleni: depemds on the guess of Mike Sofios|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Bidding visionaries often aren;t appreciated|pg||
nt|goss: I agree with X|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eleni: S has to give up his losers early enough and guess correctly the @H|pg||
nt|baardolav: we see the transfer in action here|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bill recommended 3nt|pg||
nt|goss: I know :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still do ... but I certainly accept the double|pg||
nt|goss: thanks !|pg||
nt|veistikke:  or @c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: ghestem sorry|pg||
nt|dkkello: I am told to moderate my nice words from before , I hereby do so by 25 %|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: thanks, vugraph|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is hard ...and Delle Cave 4nt made things easy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  i dont belive on that result after a splead in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@D is down on a @S lead????|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently Fryklund didn't believe his partner has any trumps, but he had a trump trick himself|pg||
nt|bagman: now the @HQ scores and NS can take the club ruff, too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem with the double ... partner bids 4@C, and there goes 3NT which could easily be your only making game|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||
nt|goss: then hope to also make 5@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
nt|8252: double ruff brings 12 easy tricks, if W doesn't switch @s : 9 @s K @d and the 2 aces|pg||
nt|rado: that's the reason people open 3@S sometimes:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chrisky: no quess is neded|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cicus: 1ha shows nt hand or hearts and clubs, 1sp asks, 1 nt shows balanced hand - same spec|pg||
nt|baardolav: a good game 5@d, a little bit unlucky|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for your kind help, all pectators|pg||
nt|cicus: good contract reached|pg||
nt|dkkello: I know!   read my E-mail adress!|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding here|pg||
nt|galois85: so let's get back to 15-15? |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So they one good slambidding and one bad  |pg||
nt|friggi: this will bring some IMP's to Sweden:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here the bidding was natural |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eleni: and that was not the card it should have feen plaued:)|pg||
nt|timve:  south tries to find an 6 sixth trick|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|key1809: wouldnt he open 1nt with 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|eleni: now things look a lot brighter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19-11 VPs is my guess|pg||
nt|goss: here once you have made the 3 and 4 of spade, you're home|pg||
nt|bebechira: Italy is extending the lead , but unfortunately for them..Israel is only 11 imps down to Netherlands at the moment|pg||
nt|8252: correct, but on @s switch, Robert must play on his @c, with precise timing|pg||
nt|goss: all that results are not helping my country !|pg||
nt|goss: yes, @s switch would have jeopardize the contrat|pg||
nt|lechcold: teraz bêdzie -2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: A new @H are normaly the best def. Don't matter here.|pg||
nt|eleni: now it's imperative the 9|pg||
nt|eleni: well even that:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: A@s @s AND A @c return -1 |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|liujing: is that necessary to cover Q?|pg||
nt|famus: last chance|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nice def|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lady007: he'd better give his partner a club ruff or there wont even be a 5th trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark now a firm 3rd 17 vps ahead of France|pg||
nt|veistikke:  avoid would be nice :P. |pg||
pc|h8|nt|eugenio123: with 5 cardss majors?|pg||
nt|8252: forced to play well now, like we say in the Lions Club of Derbyshire|pg||
nt|8252: it's funny to see how double ruff play is not natural : this board should take 30 seconds |pg||
nt|goss: he might be tired...|pg||

nt|kaapo: Some choices how to bid after the reverse|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @S 10 would be wrong.. i highly doubt W would play a @S back if he had an honour if he had and felt endplayed it would 100% be the K;)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chrisky: quess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: for those more interested in the meaning of bids: 2@C Stayman, 2@S 4@S, 3@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|cicus: but S did not obey|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: all specs, and co-commentators|pg||
nt|ybob: can E read the @C suit to win 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe if S open weak @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: but juniors open 1@D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: but if S open weak @d , they will play 5@d i think |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north may bid spades first|pg||
nt|ybob: but lost 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: they take a break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lose 4 trump tricks in 5 diamonds it seems|pg||

nt|bebechira: Israel-Netherlands 35-36 so 15-15|pg||

mb|p!|nt|ahri:  most probably 3NT hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and took 9 lol:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cicus: they must steer away from the rather poor slam|pg||
nt|ritong: just needs a @d jack to produce a cold slam|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|cicus: if the bid slam with @DJ and stay in 5@D without it we say well done|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if 2@s describes this handtype, the @s K is not wasted|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 4 @s but bad sits -down 1 is the destany|pg||

pc|cK|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||

nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||

nt|goss: who are you refering to ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|friggi: need also friendly lead:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: this rather offtrack opening might get them out of game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Todor, our excellent operator in Albena. Good job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: thx|pg||
nt|timve:  and preferably fast and convincing|pg||
nt|lechcold: korzystne uk³ady i 3BA na 24PC wychodzi bez problemu|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor, our great operator!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|eleni: Last board for this round:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we are back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden may even gain 12 IMPs here, but it won't change the result, 19-11|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d bye N|pg||
nt|lechcold: juniorom licytacja nie powinna sprawi trudnoci:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: sprawiæ|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@H to piki|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if dbl would be penalty i would either dbl or bid 2@S on N hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I'll be back at 16:20 cet to comment italian girl... who knows what my eyes will see lol|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: the lower you stop in @S the better|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N for east here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Earlier I remarked that it has been a tough day for Finland - but tougher still it is for the operators, who may have to keep focused through all 60 boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is the last board... we have to thank to Todor our vg operator...a wonderful job|pg||
nt|veistikke:  i still wonder how they got 7 tricks inn 1@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: next room could not avoid the 6@d snag|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Häxan in effect here?|pg||
nt|bagman: interesting 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so well done|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor for the fine work|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eugenio123: it seems they play forcing nt, another terrible convention I would never play|pg||
nt|ahri:  would be fun to see club lead with diamond underlead on 4@s. just for sake of entering bulletin.|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: :) ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sweating time for east|pg||
nt|ahri:  and a great lead for south|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think he is in control|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c showing any 16+ or 14-16 with 6@s|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@D showing 8+ and GF opposite 16+|pg||
nt|dkkello: 3 NT ?|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is good|pg||
nt|ybob: hard now  3nt :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S is a overbid|pg||
nt|goss: thanks Todor|pg||
nt|rado: down 2 probably now but hard to dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: :)u wlc|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this looks like 4 @s but can you make it -you have to be careful -@d ruff beats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He showed a cl suit here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C would be strong or long @Hs - so with clubs Mikael has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bagman: In NT the defense can grab 7 first tricks (and declarer has only 6 quick)|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: i like to play it as SFG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 1½ hours with 4 more matches|pg||
nt|kaapo: Though maybe 1NT would be an option also|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Madala shows only @d in other room |pg||
nt|zebutin: seems finns are pushing for slam on 17...so might be again chunk of imps coming to Finlands bag|pg||
nt|lechcold: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how they "only" got or how they GOT 7:)?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
nt|ybob: as 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west should have bid 4 spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: and of course many thanks to Bill, Adrien and Rado..excellent job as well|pg||
nt|lechcold: wyniki live|pg||
nt|lechcold: no niestety...|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie nasza para otwiera bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|veistikke:  how they only got :P|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like this may turn out for a decent match for our team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure I care for that 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: ka¿de 11, itp|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table made it i am told|pg||
nt|famus: this has been an eventful contest--both teams played well--But i give my vote to the Danes as winner in todays contest--they displayed great resilience--well done--Thanks alll|pg||
nt|liujing: last board|pg||
nt|liujing: a lot of swings in this segment|pg||
nt|spenny80: buffon|pg||
nt|spenny80: sorry it was my pw|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
nt|bagman: this might make for a small gain compared to 1NT down one|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I see now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rado: tx all operator kibs and commentators:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
nt|lechcold: st¹d brak inwitu 2BA od Tuczyñskiego|pg||
pc|h9|nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
nt|kaapo: France up against Israel, so with a great result, Italy would've been much closer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|d4|nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
nt|goss: 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|liujing: thx all|pg||
nt|famus: I was going to respond--since I praised the Danish boys more--maybe the Italian in you got aroused and called me a buffoon--haha:))))np Fabio|pg||
nt|liujing: 4@S is played in open room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ntmon: 3NT is normal but destined to fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: next match of Italy is the decisive one...they face Israel and ONLY a big win will give them any chances to the title|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ussaly when you dont get many tricks in a contract there is can be 2 reasons  1. Bad declaring 2. good defence;)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chrisky: claim|pg||
nt|chrisky: =|pg||
nt|mamos: bad news for Greece from OR |pg||
nt|mamos: as 3@sx=|pg||
nt|veistikke:  ;)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pinticus: 2off|pg||
nt|lady007: he knows partner will only have 4 (4th best leads) so the 9 is only wrong if partner led from AQ8x|pg||
nt|timve:  yep |pg||
nt|timve:  think if north plays a heart |pg||
nt|timve:  west will cash his trikcs|pg||
nt|timve:  for 9|pg||
nt|lady007: yes|pg||
nt|frankbo: down now i thk|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ntmon: we have seen solid performance by both teams|pg||
nt|ntmon: but let's move to OR for final boards|pg||
nt|pinticus: thx all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: 1@D-1NT is an  easy pass for me|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|mamos: the match has seemed quite close but too many silly mistakes from Greek team |pg||
nt|chrisky: specialy in the other room|pg||
nt|eleni: The kids are stressed, from all sides we suppose|pg||
nt|baardolav: with 16 too?|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT then|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: how old are this pair?|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can cash the @SA and play on sidesuits for a make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|timve:  now a free finesse|pg||
nt|dkkello: very close around 3 position now , this will be 17-13 or so for denmark |pg||
pc|sT|nt|veistikke:  should have returned @s back :P|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|zlatan: its good they finished 50 minutes earlier than given time, they have time to rest to take maximum Vs  last placed Belgium |pg||
nt|runnerup: yes that was not a good idea in this board -to ruff heart |pg||
nt|frankbo: down 2 i thk|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|andreasw:  So last board of the match! Thx to fellow commentators specs players and vugraph cordinator! |pg||

nt|kaapo: Things were better than declarer feared: both red suits were more even than might've been|pg||
nt|goss: bye all|pg||
