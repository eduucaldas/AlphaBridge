nt|rnmalik: possible.|pg||
nt|panosk: so its only -2 then|pg||
nt|runnerup: so was a partial swing for England |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: this board should be shown to those who claims not to open weak 2 with Hxx in the other major :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3@S was clear misclick|pg||

nt|frankaus: expexting|pg||
nt|panosk: 3NT not good here with spade lead, beter end up in 5@D|pg||
nt|leao:  Shah knows his pard is very short in @c|pg||
nt|leao:  and he has prime values in the no-clubs suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: sorry I have yo comment in th open one lol bye|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  will EW find 4 Sp now?|pg||
nt|riccho:  was it only 2@s? |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello  all |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: the contract was 3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS plays 5 card Major and 15-17 Nt|pg||
nt|peachy: if the auction comes back to S at P-P, she has too many spades to balance in with anything|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: co nienajlepiej siê dzieje w polskiej dru¿ynie jeli zmienia siê pary|pg||
nt|frankaus: expecting  - 3rg try :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 3rd :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S may be passed and would be a good board for NL.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'n my day no selfrespecting executive could type :(|pg||
nt|panosk: and avoid 6@D for the same reason|pg||
nt|leao:  stiff ace claimed its toll|pg||
nt|daman: pass was not on my radar with the North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: sry its 4@S=|pg||
nt|leao:  agree... he could have tried a bit|pg||
nt|daman: I might have bid 5@H   or even blackwood|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: Do not need to count HCP for balancing. Anything that was good enough to open, is good enough to balance back in, if the shape is right (short their suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Hi all:) I will comment, but in Polish - I m Ryszard Kielczewski|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: rdble show this same number of cards in majors|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@c of course show majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: 0708 in Washington DC |pg||
nt|riccho:  hi shirley :) |pg||
nt|leao:  i like 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S can make 6@d, but getting to 5 may be hard|pg||
nt|loe48: hi Ryskiel|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: celne otwarcie Overbeeke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N showed minimum and S hand is not that strong for the raise.|pg||
nt|frankaus: still i was keen on laptop typing :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: if K@S is on :)?|pg||
nt|antoniz: 2kier-czwarty kolor|pg||
nt|juror1: witam serdecznie w ostatnim meczu ME Juniorek, jak zapewne wiecie, Polki zagwarantowa³y ju¿ sobie tytu³ Mistrzyñ Europy - GRATULACJE :). Mecz komentuje Antoni Zdzienicki|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a lot to do with little transportation |pg||
nt|riccho:  If the defense is not able to punish W for his bidding, will W go even further with his preempt bidding? |pg||
nt|le joker: nice auctions|pg||
nt|frankbo: u thk so|pg||
nt|frankbo: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i like 1NT by E more|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: opening or rebid over 1@s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|z_lasu: na drugim stole ekspecki wist w 8@d|pg||
nt|bcmandal: clubs 3-3 5d makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: Hello :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must admit too hard to avoid 3NT here, i'm i wudnt have|pg||
nt|frankbo: guess it shows 18-19|pg||
nt|le joker: they play 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: then opening :)|pg||
nt|frankbo: now we are talking|pg||
nt|frankbo: def 1N opening|pg||
nt|le joker: only 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i am so used with precisin that i cant imagine @H opening with 19 pts :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: precision'|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: ah thats trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: not that easy to be reach..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: S can see all working cards on bidding & will bid 4@d now i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Dr Raghavan|pg||
nt|runnerup: a lot off waisted values in @c ontrack -in diamonds ,but here you need thos e honors |pg||
nt|raghavan: GM marukku - again we meet|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: not at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|athene: -200 is just too much of a worry|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was tough, N did all he could too|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think S, with 4 trumps and a stiff spade should have bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the best def was 3 rounds @d|pg||
nt|panosk: *i'm sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gronkvist:  and now showed 5@s|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: first blood for Netherland|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bcmandal: 2s+1d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: we all know where it is:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamiast 2kier,lepiej opisze rekê inwityj¹ce 2NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 has no chance.|pg||
nt|riccho:  The S hand looks very notrumpish, so at both tables the player decided to just jump into 3NT.|pg||
nt|veistikke:  wouldnt 1@c be the opening then? |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 3s+1d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: nt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: north's 3@C was a bit weird but obviously he didn't want to double and hear hearts from his partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But s thought wisely that 3 Nt is a better contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  as the hand lies 4@h is an easy going, but 3NT is not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: w otwartym Magda zalicytowa³a 1 BA z rêk¹ N|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: Yes, S could bid more at some time, I don;t think N could do anything different as it went|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: as kier = zagranie sprawdzaj¹ce - bijesz to karo ili niet?|pg||
nt|daman: he can claim 7|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: specs suggest that north might double 3@S, but you are not so aggressive doubling partscores for one down if opps are not vul|pg||
nt|athene: because turning 50 into 100 often is not that big a deal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like turning 100 into 200 which is worth a big risk|pg||
nt|henryb:  anyway, -50 should be very good for E-W|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko ¿e teraz mo¿e powstaæ poszum...na szczêcie nie|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: S would be careful in discards to save the @S.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|leao:  difficult for him to conduct the auction... pard mite have had a pressure bid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|frankbo: trange way to play|pg||
nt|veistikke:  ok :P Inn norway most dont open 1nt with 5 card major. (some do) I mean its not the best option :P|pg||
nt|frankbo: strange|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: looks like he is home now |pg||
nt|riccho:  but after 2times non-club play N has enought tricks |pg||
nt|leao:  claim now|pg||
nt|le joker: YES...|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But W could always make it but it would be harder|pg||
nt|frankbo: no entry to H suit|pg||
nt|le joker: i am ok with 5 card major, but 3 card in the other major :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: a big enough double fit that both sides can legitimately bid at five level|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Would you bid again Martin?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 24 combined strenght of NS hands and likely a NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 23|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d for both MAJ is somewhat unusual here. The E hand looks very weakish for such a move. And I guess W will confirm this view|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: hey|pg||
nt|sybarra: but does get the hand across in one bid |pg||

nt|leao:  and at the onset of the match too|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|leao:  argh|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: not everyone is going to bid 2@D on that west hand|pg||
nt|panosk: E must try to ruff a couple of @D losers in dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: 9@H a value card.|pg||
nt|daman: this will not be good|pg||
nt|leao:  no, it doesnt rate to be, at all|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: even with a decent six-card suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only 6 pairs on board 2 played in @d, and many sold out to low level spade contracts|pg||
nt|psyck: You could probably count the people bidding 2@d at this vul in the fingers of 1 hand|pg||
nt|athene: i sympathise with 3@C - west could have had some clubs on the bidding and 2@DX is pretty much sure to be bad|pg||
nt|athene: of course, most of the time 3@C will be bad too, but sometimes you might escape|pg||
nt|galois85: 9 tricks now for n/s, 6@d 2@c and 1@h|pg||
nt|leao:  so they start with a 20+ IMP deficit to recover|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|raghavan: Hoping Sq as entry |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: shouldnt have discarded a @c|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s lead would have stopped entryes to table -and no chance but even now too many loosers|pg||
nt|raghavan: May play clubs or Hearts knowing Spade Q is a possible entry|pg||
nt|leao:  at least it wasnt doubled|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|nt|henryb:  question is whether you should try your 6 card suit. Since partner did not make a takeout double he probably has a flaw, and the flaw id more likely clubs than spades|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may play it as if any michaels bid  (weak or strong) |pg||
nt|veistikke:  3@H = 6@h 4+ Minor? |pg||

nt|leao:  4@h seems cold for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  although I think 3@S was a little optimistic|pg||

nt|riccho:  N might think about 3NT in fact... |pg||
nt|leao:  double?|pg||
nt|leao:  i much rather he bid @s at this junction|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: so you both somewhere around:)?|pg||
nt|leao:  well, the suit is very good|pg||

nt|timverbeek:  guess 9 tricks|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW makes. Losing 3 aces. Am I right?|pg||
nt|chrisky: 4@S go down on a trump lead or switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  an eye doctor show the chart full of w's, y's, k0s, "Can you read that?" Patient:"Of course, I am Polish"|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will E lead clubs?  |pg||
nt|riccho:  A youthful 3@d and a !youthful 3NT = airy contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|eugenio123: mi pare un down|pg||

nt|panosk: N cant make it without some "help" from the defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|z_lasu: other tablem stopped in blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: on the way|pg||
nt|frankaus: prob make it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  48 imps lost in 4 Boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect coaches will have something to say as they go over the hands |pg||
nt|riccho:  true|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT -3 in the OR was mildly aggressive|pg||
nt|leao:  still that may garner some IMPs as the other table was in a weird contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eugenio123: quadri al 7 sembra l'unica giocata possibile, x quanto cmq inutile|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makeable now as W has no entry to play @S.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|athene: i assume it's a polish-club type auction|pg||

nt|leao:  they must know they are well ahead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: the fridly D layout would prob get dec home on any lead  on last|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 2nd pass from EW with 12 points ..|pg||
nt|leao:  fewer advances, and all that|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: bêd¹ gra³y w piki|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max a partial. 3@C or 3@H.|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|possessed: an aggressive one|pg||

nt|frankaus: i open  - has 27 zars |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like another 4@s hand|pg||

nt|eugenio123: 3nt senza storia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|possessed: will end up at 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is close, but 3nt is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult for n/s to get the club suit in now |pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if W passes it may go X |pg||
nt|rnmalik: may see 2@H being played.|pg||

nt|riccho:  at least both hungarian teams cannot complain about each other. Both pairs had taken their part to this|pg||
nt|sybarra: never good |pg||
nt|riccho:  12-14 NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: ye|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  hmm South a little passive in my opinion|pg||
nt|chrisky: x or 2nt prommising the minors?|pg||
nt|sybarra: they bid Norths suit,  this isnt easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1NT maybe ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: does 2 nt promise minors? |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: over @C+@D nat by opps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 nt is option is if coming in |pg||
nt|rnmalik: x here would bring in @S:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: can south realise that north not so serious -he did|pg||
nt|riccho:  as I said before, difficult to defend this blast into 3NT bidding sequences|pg||
nt|leao:  lets hope they bid this one|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzjs: he chose to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: guess he bidd 6C now|pg||

pc|c5|nt|timverbeek:  but on this board your probably right, cause after 3@D opponents can get in 4@S and that contract has a good chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  EW were second last EC in 2009 in Brasov|pg||

nt|frankaus: u lead ur top card view dummy will always set it |pg||
nt|rnmalik: or @D Ace.|pg||
nt|runnerup: 6 @h needs finess only about so near 50%|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: I wonder if it is better to bid 1@s or dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@c is 20-21 nt or any FG hand|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: komentuje Grzegorz Gardynik |pg||
nt|jkotor: na razie zostawiam Pañstwa z Antonim, obiadek :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H is serious overbid, 2@H was fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  in Sweden you open 2NT with 22-23|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: 1@D is transfer |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: for @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|timverbeek:  and 20-21 in 2@C|pg||
nt|saverio: are you sure about 1@h operator?|pg||
nt|saverio: he should have bid 1@d i think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: both reds|pg||
nt|pinticus: NS play transfers over 1@c-X|pg||
nt|saverio: but if i can remember they play transfer bids over 1@c X|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: they do :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: my misclick it seems|pg||
nt|pinticus: so it is 1@c-X-1@d|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@H diff to make imagine E trying for highet as he shud|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: once I asked Arturo Franco and he told me wo bid dbl with 5/3 in majors|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  what is the philosophy behind that?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @c J is not good for the def|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  To stop in 2M when u are weak|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard to find the @h lead against a slam here, especially from W|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  sounds good|pg||
nt|yuval10: and even moreso after 3@h by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this hand was a point count trap, much of wests cards are really of no value|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: wg tablicy, ktora mam przed soba jest 10-8 dla naszych|pg||

mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Indeed|pg||
nt|pinticus: 4@s OR EW|pg||

pc|c3|nt|timverbeek:  wow|pg||

nt|mich-b: big chance missed in the Open room - West could defeat 5@H by leading a @D|pg||
nt|daman: another pianola hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: a chance for glory :|pg||
nt|yuval10: i predict just made|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably will only make 5 |pg||
nt|panosk: pls remember that negative double promises indeed 4 cards in @H in this position but its only competitive not game forcing|pg||
nt|raghavan: one finesse is done here - courtesy Opp|pg||
nt|riccho:  there is the reason... |pg||
nt|leao:  then he'll give 2@d and 1@s, no?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  I would do a quiet 4@D|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe even +1 with a psedo-squeeze over E now|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but this is winning|pg||
nt|antoniz: piki do sto³u i 10 lew|pg||
nt|sybarra: to get him to run that is reason |pg||
nt|riccho:  dont understand this|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: tel see if E pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: lets'|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would sit and blame pard if I dont make it  (Joke)|pg||
nt|riccho:  W knows that his pard has 4c@h suit. So W has 7 Tricks in his bag and only needs 1 Ace by partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: would do the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and look how many imps that would have been |pg||

pc|sK|nt|panosk: it might be but it will be revealed later on|pg||

nt|riccho:  now its just a boring flat board...?|pg||
nt|riccho:  I wouldnt have dream of bidding 4@c|pg||

pc|s6|nt|eugenio123: 1@s now is hard to respect, just some gift to respect that|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will be hard to stop in 2@h|pg||

pc|cA|nt|psyck: this defense makes it easy for declarer, not there there was much defense could do|pg||
nt|henryb:  working hard on setting up declarer's tricks|pg||
nt|panosk: in other room more conservative 3@H appeared after double but still very high for me|pg||
pc|c6|nt|timverbeek:  think optimism scores more points than pessimism |pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  a not great 3N that makes when both majors (and @d) split nicelay And the !k is onside|pg||

nt|daman: this seems like a routine contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  maybe 22%?|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer decides the hearts are 4-4 he can play on spades with the club finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks they are 5-3 he might just take the club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: now the 3NT will come from W|pg||
nt|daman: not so at the other table|pg||
nt|daman: the Brits bid to slam -1|pg||

nt|yuval10: not so easy now...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|timverbeek:  hard for east to decide|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|riccho:  sounded like him|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: they needed to double hook the @H to make    |pg||
pc|h5|nt|pinticus: no,seems 1off with best defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: assuming he trusts opps|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure that entry was worth it |pg||
pc|h9|nt|saverio: 1off requires a @c guess|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: and best declearer play|pg||
nt|saverio: and a perfect timing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dzeronimo: czesto w takich aukcjach pojawia sie problem niewiedzy partnera z czym daj¹ splintera. i tutaj hacze troche o problem fundamentalny, bo patrzac na przeszlosc przydalyby sie drobne ...|pg||

pc|d3|nt|yuval10: not sure about the A@h...N could very well had TXX @h|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  think low diamond is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze Piotrek, dobrze...ja o tym tr¹biê od wielu lat|pg||

nt|sybarra: will N bid again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: looks like flat |pg||
nt|riccho:  Why on earth did S not try to cash his @hA? He has 2 trump tricks for sure and a @d trick in his bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with overcalling on the west hand is you might persuade partner to make a costly heart lead against a spade contract|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@d was better|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but many countries are not able to form a girlsteam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That depends on partnership agreement some play 2@D and some 2@H.|pg||
nt|daman: another easy game|pg||
nt|frankbo: no 3 cl i guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjs: maybe not natural..|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 2@c as gazzilli|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: can't|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@H has some chances, the @C loser might disappear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C now by W.|pg||
nt|raghavan: OH??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but of course there are advantages for overcalling too|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I think donati had to pass on 2 @d then east may've had some troubles|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT is a super accept of @Hs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|eugenio123: 2@d realay at least 7 points|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: niby du¿o, szczególnie do Szwedek ale zarówno one jak i Francuzki dostaj¹ zadyszki w 2 czêci meczu|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m feeling here like at a robot tournament|pg||
nt|leao:  exchange the EW hands and 6 is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: another 3nt try, which will be doomed|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  even 'big' bridgecountries like Norway cannot form a team |pg||
nt|yuval10: NS were forced out of the bidding with their 24 HCP combined|pg||
nt|loe48: like now if a 2h opener and h lead to ace..then you of cos lay down dia ace fast..i want to see west in eyes then to top spades|pg||
nt|loe48: a weak opener with 2 aces doent have more..but we can lie as now when its stiff|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead now allows declarer to get a diamond away|pg||

nt|sybarra: landed in an interesting spot |pg||
nt|chrisky: best lead is a @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: like a a fellow spec said 6@D way beter chnaces|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: While EW are by far the slowest players at the table W just urged S to make a call because of the time|pg||
nt|panosk: *chances|pg||
nt|leao:  what's 3@s?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eugenio123: 3@c normal 5@s 4@c strong|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Something happen E thought 3@C shows @S and @D|pg||
nt|loe48: normally a weak 2 opener doent contain 2 aces even|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @c to king and cash the 9 :P|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: he might think west was finessing against dummy with @HK109|pg||
nt|eugenio123: donati will surely lead @d10|pg||
nt|sybarra: the bots are indeed equally dangerous at time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: discard @C against 4-0?|pg||
nt|riccho:  just a few hours ago I played an indi here: pard bid 1Di - 1He - 3NT with KQx x KQxxx A10x|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: so he might not want to finesse the queen|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1nt scared them -ofcause 4 is not the best conctrackt of the world but playable|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cicus: I may have misanalyzed this, declarer may discard all her @Cs on @Hs now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo over 2@C by N, E had a chance to bid 2@H showing 4 card support.|pg||

nt|mareczek: nie, to by³ priv znów, przepraszam|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: witaj|pg||
nt|daman: good thing they stopped|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cicus: the defence cannot attack clubs to advantage, as leading the suit costs a trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no play except for making 12 or 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vbman: after the overcall needs to finesse south|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  maybe a club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: some people lead high from three small if they are known to have length in the suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. having raised partner)|pg||
nt|henryb:  But it will not cost in the end|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jigs up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: i have lost the play sry |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|eugenio123: when your opp bids in this way it is sure he's got good stoppers in majors|pg||
nt|riccho:  A10xx in @c ...|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: we have seen many hands today where declarer played too many rounds of trumps too early and allowed a defender to play more later|pg||

nt|sybarra: adn 2 nt is usually honor 3 or better  |pg||
nt|sybarra: the relay suit saying "I like clubs" |pg||

mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  west to the rescue|pg||
nt|yuval10: S IMO has a lot more than enough to carry on. He can see slam's making against A@s QJ@h Q@c|pg||

nt|sybarra: trying for the club ruff is my guess |pg||
nt|riccho:  compare the 3@s here with what W had done in bd 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand a far better (imo)|pg||
nt|riccho:  is this really the difference between red and white?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 2@H over 1@S with north hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: now 4NT is asking for aces excluding the @d suit, so N knows to show only 1 ace|pg||

nt|cicus: 5@C was a good save even if they did not let it make|pg||

nt|panosk: 3nt non existant contract tremendous overbid from both players|pg||
mb|2S|nt|timverbeek:  and then your missing a lot if you pass|pg||
nt|cicus: (5@C goes down on a @H ruff)|pg||
nt|vbman: but colours are for kids... l dont agree|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good learning.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|eugenio123: 1nt??? why not 2 or 3@C?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  with the north hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dzeronimo: brawo, na drugim stole doszli|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess it depends how much the defenders were signalling distribution in the other suits|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you signal religiously you don't let declarers get away with that sort of thing|pg||
nt|athene: but it does cost in other ways|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "west should take the setting trick" but this is MP and the difference between -1 and -2 might have been very great on that board|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the lead of the @DJ was a bit suspicious though|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly could not have more than two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he had @DK10 doubleton why would he lead the jack?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no mam niezawodnego Grzesia Gardynika do krótkiej pomocy|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjs: cant ask her right now :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: mam do powiedzenia bardzo wa¿ny komentarz, ale o tym w nastêpnym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|yuval10: P from E looks a bit ode|pg||
nt|yuval10: over the X|pg||
nt|dzeronimo: tym razem +6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: only a @c back after a @s lead prevent overtricks|pg||
nt|psyck: with poor @h's & MP's, they choose to play in NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps West should reason that the opponents have only 24 HCP and therefore many won't be in game and a plus is a plus|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The standings in this match are 55-34 to poland |pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: we have lost the comparasons from a few boards:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: that's why|pg||
nt|eugenio123: that's just another way to see this game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: yep|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  WD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D would be disturbing.|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we call it "not fun" |pg||
nt|mich-b: I would prefer a "trap pass" with East , playing for penalties...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: otherwise declarer has time to develope 2 @d tricks and takes 10 tricks for a great score|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S a better contract here|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and think west should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  hand seems worthless in 3NT|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bravo zazzà|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  think you might be right |pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: Though likely to be difficult, quantum of 25 points is there for a3NT |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  but after a heartlead from north.....|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  4@S is without chance|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mignon87: 2@d by north over south's 1NT would have shown 18-20 points with any shape|pg||
nt|leao:  that cud be bloody|pg||
nt|mich-b: this time however, NS would be able to escape comfortably to @Ss|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|cicus: I think 5@S was a make with open cards even on a trump lead|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|psyck: some would chose to play in NT with 4333 shape with W I suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS are the new leaders , but only 2.5 points ahead of the Israeli pair Ginossar-Pachtman|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|c4|nt|henryb:  I have a kibitzer who says you should only play the 5-3 when the short hand has a ruffing value|pg||

nt|rnmalik: needed passive defence, small @S.|pg||

nt|yuval10: 9 tricks won't be a good success against 10 tricks in 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 tricks not so easy in 4@s either|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: not easy to do given E hand with the aces I think |pg||

nt|yuval10: now only @c prevent an overtrick,,,,if he plays @h declarer needs to jump with the K|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he plays @h then declarer is between top and bottom - K@h means 11 tricks and a top, low @h means 9 tricks and a bad score|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: but perhaps use extra diamond entry|pg||

nt|rnmalik: only a NT contract can be made. A@S and ruff would set any other contract.|pg||
nt|ritong: they can engineer a trump promotion|pg||
nt|ritong: say three rounds of @h, avoid the overruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  perhaps not - I was assuming E would lead the @dA|pg||
nt|psyck: @d punches will trouble declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  He will go down anyway on the @s lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: S's overcall is marginal, and it forced him to an uncomfotable bid in the 2nd round|pg||

nt|vugraphzjs: Of course; after a claim play stops. Period. However, since I am just a kibitzer I cannot say anything|pg||
nt|panosk: i mean such a play under the Q @D i wud expect from players like ZIA, Lauria, Helgemo, several top Americans and a handfull more|pg||
nt|runnerup: so well defended and declarer play not best pos|pg||

nt|riccho:  inv with long @d?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: seems too few |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: In the morning a player from Poland misdefended a hand and I was informed would be subject to 100 situps after the match. Agreement between the team. Poland won alright but tough:)|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 3@h than is getting misterious|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: yes Pass too... but not 1 nt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: i really don't like 2@c. If you decided to open 1@d you have to stand behind your bid|pg||

nt|ritong: on the other hand, he can have a wild distribution and 5@s is cold|pg||
