nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi all -- will get the names in shorttly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators Larry and Jack|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|leo lasota: hi all|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: Good luck Ross|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Roland and Jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|joest: North has a typical problem, which I usually solve by just raising to 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: yes partner might have only 3 but other calls distort.  Plus raising comes in handy if partner can compete to the three level with four or five clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: and Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=BAL, 8-10|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 14+ balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|joest: some would try negative double and hope to survive.  I used to do that but gave it up|pg||
nt|larrymori: hi Kit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = baron with modified responses|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows 4@S and denies 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hey kit|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play that a double (or 1@S) covers 4 or 5 spades, you can use the remaining action as take-out for the minors, but that is not standard.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ira and Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|kit: it is becoming a more popular treatment|pg||
nt|chorush: Welcome back everyone to the thir quarter of the finlals of the Grand National Teasms|pg||
nt|joest: hi ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: somehow I don't think this was the auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D is RKC in @S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chorush: Hi Kit, Hi Larry|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hi Ira|pg||
nt|chorush: Hi Al|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 w/queen|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|brolucius: Since South had not promised four clubs with his opening bid, he feels entitled to compete one level higher.|pg||
nt|kit: tricky hand to play due to the diamond blockage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table is visible via   http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|joest: jack of diamonds is a nice card.  Permits this to make a slam even with losers in both majors|pg||
nt|chorush: About the quickest 11 imps I've seen in a while|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, it was a super slam|pg||
nt|joest: what kind of hand would you bid 3@s on as a passed hand that would not Drury?  |pg||
nt|joest: I have my own theories but so what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi All.  We started late and I'm just catching up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I don't see bidding 3@H with 4-3-3-3, 4 clubs, 3 hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can expect his partner to be very short in clubs and hopes that his 9 points will be enough 3@H, despite holding only 3-card support.|pg||
mb|5N|nt|kit: both 3@C and 3@H need to make to show a real profit, and that just isn't likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: It appears that with favorable trump lie, Rodwell will discard 2 spades on his long diamonds to make 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT = 2|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He cannot expect his side to hold 9 hearts between them, or West would have doubtless bid 3@H himself, following the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Boyd is taking control as South after  1@D-1@S//4@H  [bal, slam try with 4@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he couldn't diagnose the perfect minor fits either  so 6@S in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Palmer's first decision of the set and she is taking her time.|pg||
nt|loe48: not a bad grandslam if you know what kings south have|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: and with a stiff club West might have bid 3@H anyway with offensive orientation|pg||
nt|kit: and not surprisingly, it is likely that both contracts will go down 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fans of the Law of Total Tricks will smile tolerantly and say 'What did they expect?'|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd pretty much has to hope South has ace-doubleton of hearts to even have a chance|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention that the ace of spades is on side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a new concept for Beth Palmer|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|kit: South is "marked" with ace of hearts, since North is assumed to have ace of spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|larrymori: he can pitch 2 @cs too|pg||
nt|chorush: but he may have to guess well to do it right|pg||
nt|larrymori: he needs to play on @ds now|pg||
nt|chorush: He has to worry that if he draws the next rump, when he leads a diamond they will win, blocking the suit and destroy the entry to his hand in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- he doesn't know opponents can't lead a second club|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|kit: or suppose opponents just duck 2 rounds of diamonds.  then he only has 5 trumps, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs for sure|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: However, it will be very difficult for Boyd to find this defense|pg||
mc|13|nt|kit: he is playing along dummy reversal lines -- perhaps planning on ruffing another club, hoping diamonds 3-3, and then end-playing opponents -- very sensible |pg||
pg||

nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: there is a problem because the Screen has no flap... :/|pg||
nt|kit: we get to start off with a nice dull grand slam which won't be so easy to bid I don't think.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: perfect fit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|joest: this is quite the fitting hand for a grand slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kit: key question is whether Robinson will bid 3@S or think his hand is stronger|pg||
nt|joest: it's on the borderline|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|timb: the 1=5 @C break would point the right way to play the @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: with spades 32 you don't need to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H shows a balanced 4@S call|pg||
nt|timb: true, i'm a bit slow this laye at nihjt|pg||
nt|joest: just curious: 4@s is some 'playing strength' call?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|joest: it happens to everybody Tim.  Just keep putting out those great books of yours and we'll all be happy|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S would be a distributrional thing of some kind|pg||
nt|timb: I was thinking 7NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|swanson: This is an unusual use for a double jump reverse.  The most frequent use is short hearts of some kind.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can see the keycards, but not the fillers|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: Robinson has the fillers, but he isn't in charge|pg||
nt|joest: now does 6@d ask for third round control?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|kit: no 3rd round control stuff I don't think|pg||
nt|kit: Now Boyd might bid 6NT, which has to suggest the grand|pg||
nt|joest: that is dynamite I agree.  Even good pairs revert to cue bidding or other stuff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: so laydown grand missed here -- and missed in other room also|pg||
nt|swanson: 6@S is no kings.  In the old days 6@C would show none and South could make a further try if he tought it was appropriate.|pg||
nt|timb: If there was a conventional agreement that 6@D over 5@C promise both minor suit kings...|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D would be offer to play I think|pg||
nt|timb: True but "if"|pg||
nt|joest: understood. Critical point for all partnerships.   In some I play it is an offer to play over a queen denial but not otherwise|pg||
nt|kit: Would have been better if North had been the RKC bidder.  He has the key queens, so he knows which kings are working.|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|swanson: If your opponents bid a making grand against you with 33HCP, a 4-4 fit, and no singletons, you aren't having a good session.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Robinson's shape was known to be 4-4-3-2, not 5-4-2-2 by the way|pg||
nt|timb: In my partnerships, given he had bid 4NT, partner would have denied 4+ diamonds |pg||

nt|brolucius: Add 4 more IMPs to the Total Tricks scales.|pg||
nt|joest: teh 14-16 NT range prevented north from getting his spade suit in|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: i guess that is 15 after all|pg||
nt|joest: but just barely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It always takes a hand or two for the VGOP to warm up.|pg||
nt|kit: I think his play was the sensible one|pg||
nt|larrymori: sure but you have to take a position|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|kit: big swing on opening lead at other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: key was 2 of clubs lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: let's try a different 1@C auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 5+@S GF or 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Meck then bid 1N or show @C??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd guess 1N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but 2@C is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Palmer probably bids at these colors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: East is considering....|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|brolucius: After the Stayman auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3NT, you should favor a major-suit lead. Do not worry that responder holds a major; worry instead that the opener does not and will be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well-stocked in the minor suits.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: the jack of hearts looks fairly normal|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson-Boyd play puppet -- this will hurt them, since West will show 4 hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'd guess that jeff will bid 1NT and r=eric would bid 2@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: pass requests clarification|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kit: now double of 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: which will warn them, so they can survive in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a chance to double.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, invite or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson considering.  Becker doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will likely shoot out 4@H, and at the unfavorable vul. Rodwell will have to sell out|pg||
nt|larrymori: cons raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod did have Intermediate 2@S available|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cole now considering after Meck's pass.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chorush: It would not be that one. I'd say 5-7, 4 trumps, with no singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they did good job with interference of 1@C auction in earlier set too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chorush: 4 hearts is beatable but mostly double dummy, so 4S down 1 may in fact be a paying save|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|loe48: what would a 2s bid mean by mech|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and roddy clarifies|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his own spades|pg||
nt|loe48: isnt 2s a ok bid here then, to fast show support|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but its very rare that opener does anyting but pass requesting clarification|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: assuming North doubles, the key will be whether Robinson-Boyd have the understandings to determine they have no spade stopper|pg||
nt|joest: there are other variations of Puppet that avoid this risk but this is the 'original' version.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit, did you invent this or am I imagining things?|pg||
nt|kit: didn't invent it, but I did publicize it|pg||
nt|joest: so now the trick is to get to 5@c and keep the loss to a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson's pass denies a spade stopper -- or at least, it should|pg||
nt|joest: Your name is attached to it in my mind :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|joest: now at this point what all is forcing?|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: To beat 4H, a diamond must be led without touching spades. Then the spade Q is an entry to beat the contract 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Waiting for Berk to finish the hand and I will enter the result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this redouble is just a repeat --|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was no doubt thinking of bidding 3@C on the previous round, but he can bid it now.|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like they will survive and get to 5@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: north dorsn't have spades necessarliy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could have 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|loe48: i got it ty..of cos then pass correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck writing something about the double.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: yes, that is pretty double-dummy, so in practice Rodwell did well to take the vul vs. not save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cole raised to 2@S naturally after Becker 2@C [vs Robinson DBL]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: X is non-forcing invite to bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no slam interest|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were lucky that Pettis did not have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: Nicely done -- unlucky to still lose 3 imps on it|pg||
nt|larrymori: that is unlikely so good save|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: I don't mind opening 1NT on East's shape, but it was a bit of a stretch with Q-J doubleton and such a relatively poor 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks like three more to Spector|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're also playing 4@S|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|loe48: dia 7 is screaming for h switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck goes for a walk and one of the entourage turns dummy.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: but @H never mentioned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubled  --   sorry I missed Peter Boyd's final bid  :(|pg||
nt|chorush: So this looks like 3 imps to Robinson for the double|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so with same hand but Rodwell holding @DK they might have found slam after the EW barrage??|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Boyd-Robinson were unlucky here that the auction let North double 2@S.  More normally Puppet has the advantage of concealing declarer's distribution.|pg||
nt|kit: 1NT might not be ideal, but that alternatives are really awful|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: curiously that's the first pickup for Robinson that is NOT double-digit|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to open 1@C and rebid 1NT, shaving off a point.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room  5@DX East|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzfc: Cole not pleased.|pg||
nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
pg||
qx|c50|st||md|4SQ86HA4DQTCAKJ942,S9HKQ3D7542CQT876,SAKJ432HT8DJ98C53,ST75HJ97652DAK63C|sv|n|nt|timb: John Swanson has it pegged|pg||
nt|kit: I believe that Boyd should have gambled it -- try constructing hands Robinson can have which justify the 4@H call, and I don't think the grand will ever be worse than a finesse.|pg||
nt|joest: i was just thinking that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kit: If the grand is no worse than a finesse and there is a reasonable chance it is laydown, the odds on bidding it at IMPs are good.|pg||
nt|joest: although AJxx/AQ/Axxx/QJx wouldn't be so hot. That's why 6@d as a 3rd round ask would be great|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wygbe1: well you could change the club qj into the heart king, same shape, no play|pg||
nt|kit: that hand wouldn't be a 4@H bid IMO|pg||
nt|kit: but you know he doesn't have the king of hearts!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: very true|pg||
nt|joest: Are Boyd and Robinson playing transfer responses?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: 1@H shows spades, as seems clear|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: double here will be support|pg||
nt|joest: support X|pg||
nt|kit: so they will get to 4@S -- Robinson will probably invite|pg||
nt|joest: well over a 3@h raise the 3@s bid loses a little of its invitational flavor but south would carry on nonetheless|pg||
nt|wygbe1: you could stick the club q into the h suit, same shape = is that worth a 4h bid? |pg||
nt|swanson: This is a type of hand where support doubles really come to th fore.  If North returns to 2@S, South can bid 3@C to show extra values with a long club suit.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|kit: Any kind of transfer type bid (rather than making a bid which might be passed) works better with a further message to say|pg||
mb|4D|nt|swanson: North would like to tranfer once again.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: do ns play 14-16 nt openers? or 15-17?|pg||
nt|kit: Now not clear if 3@S is invite or not -- But Boyd will go anyway|pg||
nt|kit: 15-17|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d will induce Berk to save|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i think its 15-17 not sure|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|5D|nt|kit: However, e-W look like they will be saving|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 4@d was an excellent call|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|joest: was 4@s really alerted?|pg||
nt|kit: Cohler will probably go back to hearts now|pg||
nt|joest: i'm surprised he didn't the first time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|kit: Meckwell took push to 5@S in other room, so we should have new leader it looks like|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a dangerous save - it will do well only because hearts are 2-2.|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- I think Cohler should have played in hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: yes it is.   diving in a 4-4 is not a growth industry|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: apparently heart shift not found vs. 5@S at other table -- a disaster.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|wygbe1: if s puts n in with spade for another club play, e will need to discard to prevent losing the heart suit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe 4@D should be used to show at least 5 diamonds; East could bid 3NT to show his actual shape.|pg||
nt|joest: now a club|pg||
nt|timb: if trumps were 4-1 we might need an abacus to calculate the damage|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|joest: when i'm getting tapped I like the safety of a six card suit :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now down only 1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|h3|nt|wygbe1: even if e discards, another club would have allowed n to ruff |pg||
mc|10|nt|timb: playing in the 6-3 fit would have been far, far safer|pg||
nt|joest: 5@s made?|pg||
pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Here we go. Now we are live.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Hi All.|pg||
nt|joest: thanks|pg||
nt|chorush: hi|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bjr henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: this hand will test how low the Meckwellopeing bid requirement go|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting play of top @D from dummy   -   i wish i could think of that type of psychological play  before it is made at the table|pg||
nt|joest: over a 3@h opener Pettis might take action, I guess with double if you feel like you got out of bed on the right side|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler might just pass seeing if a   is available at these colors|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|joest: Gary is also a BIG fan of the 'blue card' or at least he was in his younger days|pg||
nt|joest: this is cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: but removing to 5@c isn't that cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: beth isn't timid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: 500|pg||
nt|leo lasota: -500 is still much friendlier than 4h redbled making.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that lead worked out well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Boyd opened South hand 3@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
nt|leo lasota: d1 now!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chorush: Meckwell can take first 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- are you a 1@S or 1N bidder over 1@H?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
nt|kit: 6 top tricks, but hard to see where  7 will come from|pg||
nt|leo lasota: good save after all :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
nt|kit: I always bypass 4-card spade suit -- can get it back if partner is strong, and makes bidding much easier when partner knows I'm unbalanced for the 1@S rebid.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||

nt|timb: looking for a @D stopper?|pg||
nt|joest: maybe catching a heart raiase|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kit: this I know is conventional, looking for major-suit holdings|pg||
nt|joest: I have played 3@d a couple of ways here|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H shows 3 or 4 hearts I think|pg||
nt|swanson: Any bid other than pass my North looks like an effort to turn a plus into a minus.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|joest: north south would seem destined for 3NT here|pg||
nt|kit: might not be so simple with East being 6-5|pg||
nt|kit: and West having 4-card diamond support|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: if the auction times out in such a fashion that Robinson gets to show his @Ds|pg||
nt|chorush: that;s true|pg||
nt|leo lasota: win king clubs, ruff heart, club to 9 ruff heart diamond up|pg||
nt|leo lasota: low diamond lead was best dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I should know never to lead your suit."|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: Probably responsive double by Rodwell here|pg||
nt|joest: Berk might have a problem if declarer plays low but Pettis might play Cohler for KQ98 I suppose|pg||
nt|joest: still if declarer has A10 he has two tricks coming|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: Meck might bid 2@H -- not sure|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: same auction in the other room|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: looks like a zugzwang position|pg||
nt|ritong: zugzwang is a chess term, meaning that you have to play and any choice is bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Palmer is certainly deliberate in her pace of play.|pg||
nt|ritong: say east leads a @h, three rounds of trumps, then good @d guess|pg||
nt|ritong: and east is cooked|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR rates roddy's hand as 17.40|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: probably queen of diamonds played by Robinson at trick 1|pg||
nt|ritong: seeing that coming, palmer prefers to make it short|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry about that.|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like most routes lead to down 1|pg||

nt|brolucius: Perhaps he was interested to find East with a single @CK.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: is this 3@h too big?|pg||
nt|joest: guess so|pg||
nt|swanson: A 3@C preempt with the South hand can cause serious problems for the opponents but creates havoc with consturctive bidding over your own preempts.  A partnership style.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit you would bid 3@h in your sleep, right?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: Yes, I would|pg||
nt|joest: transfer then key cards?|pg||
nt|joest: then a mournful signoff in 5@s|pg||

nt|chorush: about as weak as 1C gets|pg||
nt|chorush: This is a good hand for both sides to stay low on|pg||
nt|ritong: walter?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is the weakest raise, sometimes even on Hx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Meck would RDBL to show 4+@S   i NEVER thought about 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|joest: it is of course 'more flexible' and it works well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they'll back into the 44 @S fit|pg||
nt|kit: they are in force here, so seems like South can pass and North can bid 3@S -- must be 4 since no 2@S call last time.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX doesn't show @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And why not. Must be better to show at least nine of your cards rather than six|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I like 2@S only.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: i like 2@s as well notwithstanding this result|pg||
nt|kit: true -- if it definitely showed clubs -- but most pairs play at least semi-forcing NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I think the 2@cs was semi-forcing.  If I read the hand signals correctly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or get there right away|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I like raising my partner with any excuse, but I think that vul cohler does not have a 3d raise; he did well to just pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: When East leads one red ace, declarer will assume that he must hold the other red ace too. Not that this info is particularly useful.|pg||
nt|kit: This must also show 4, since no positive in spades on first response.|pg||
nt|chorush: As it happens, EW chose the less fortunate suit to play in|pg||
nt|ritong: that's extremely interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did they ever or have the notes that i put together always been wrong??|pg||
nt|ritong: on the art to plunge opponents in the soup|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: never|pg||
nt|ritong: but please, don t try this home|pg||
nt|ritong: you might get one or two broken bones|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: You could be cold for 5@C, and even 6, while playing the hand in 2@S. North has a two-suited hand with spades and clubs, not a one-suiter with spades|pg||
nt|kit: Not 100% valid inference about the other ace -- East might prefer to lead ace-doubleton rather than from some broken diamond suit|pg||
nt|chorush: the hands fit splendidly and the lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denied a 5-card suit, so 3@S was exactly 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually this concept of transfer raises came after i raised eric on Kx at the paducah regional in the mid-80s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was it right?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he liked the idea of Hx raises with some hands but still wanted a "normal" raise available|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The number of flesh and blood kibs keeps increasing.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Up to 17 or so.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|leo lasota: no big deal since N/S make 3d.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|s5|nt|kit: The problem with this approach is now what does he do?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: To those who rebid 2@S I'd like to ask you this. What is South supposed to do over 2@S with something like   x  Axx  xxxx  KQxxx |pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chorush: It was unlikely, though not totally impossible, that 3 spades might be allowed through|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room   P-1@S//2@D-2@H//2N-3@H//P|pg||
nt|kit: AJxx an ugly suit to lead from, and gets the usual result.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so EW must play 2-way Drury|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will try to slide the 9 of hearts through -- he doesn't want it to get covered.|pg||
nt|chorush: The friendly hearts should let this one home|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks about minimum openings.  Boyd: "We aren't shy about 11 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: hands."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Interesting play problem here for cohler in 3 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: for berk that is :)|pg||
nt|chorush: The hand lies very favorably for NS but it will still be no picnic to take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who wonder what is meant by Maximal DBL   Palmer's situation was one where it would apply   3@S is just competitive [non-invite] and DBL with no room would have been the ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ONLY way to invite game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: If Meckstroth does cover, and he should, the Robinson has a problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: 2 of diamonds upside-down count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "A lot of junk." as he lays down dummy.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  for boyd-robinson  P-1M//   2@C=3-fit  2@D=4-fit|pg||
nt|chorush: Good play by Landenm makes life tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually al, they may play both X and pass as different game tries since 3@C forced them to 3@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: I don't think Robinson will be ducking any hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: North had no reason to expect such good hearts, for a NV weak two-bid. So, he tries 3NT in the hope that South has something like @SJ-x or at least @S10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: I am really surprised about what happened in the heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has the problem of being locked out of both hands.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 3NT should only be 'very wrong' when partner has mis-bid. South has just about what he has shown with regard to supporting a 3NT contract.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Becker should cash the third diamond before playing on clubs, so defense won't have a diamond exit -- but not many players think of this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Some discussion confirming that the first @d play by Boyd was USDC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kit is correct, but it will not help declarer here when West has A10xx in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: it may help for damage control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Berkowitz response to 1@S was 3@S   Cohler bid 4@S and NS were never in the auction|pg||

nt|kit: that's what IMPs is all about|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and a new leader emrges|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thx Walter -- i'd never really imagined this as forcing to 3@S  so thought 3@C-3@H could get passed out|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|kit: As seen, Boyd-Robinson open balanced 11-counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: new leader|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can be played either way|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@H overcall in other room -- more effective|pg||
nt|joest: yes it pinpointed the sixth heart and permitted south to compete to the three level|pg||
nt|brolucius: It must be East thinking - wondering how high to go on the 'double fit'.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not without risk, as partner is passed and LHO is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The suit is not exactly solid|pg||
nt|kit: it is simply a better hand description.  Sure, once in a while it might go for a number, but sometimes it is even safer to bid at the higher level immediately.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17   [3rd seat vul and 4th seat]|pg||
nt|chorush: 40 Jacks is even particularly great in pinochle|pg||
nt|ritong: actually palmer took a considerable risk|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X = 6-7 many distributions|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|chorush: isnt|pg||
nt|kit: sensible lead -- heart or club lead figures to cost more than to gain.|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Interesting decision for cohler whether to rebid 2s here.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room   1N-2@C//2@D-end|pg||
nt|ritong: winning 4 imps when it is right in the end, but risking the dreaded double game swing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: No, but if you say that you play weak-jumps vulnerable, you have to bid on that hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: It looks like the do something intelligent double|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Normally with balanced hands and 5 card majors, you just pass 1nt with 9 or 10 points, hoping that partner will be able to win enough tricks on power.|pg||
nt|chorush: Personally, I would have bid 2 spades with the south hand but i am a big fan of raising on 3 with reasonable hands|pg||
nt|leo lasota: However, with a small doubleton AND Ax in another suit, I think 2S is the winning call.|pg||
nt|chorush: Brek may have lost his best chance to make this when he didnt put up the queen. Not that he should as a normal rule but the rest of the hand lies atrociously for his side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Landen giving this play a really good think....|pg||
nt|joest: well third hand high saves the day|pg||
nt|joest: if he plays low Berk has seven tricks right now|pg||
nt|chorush: If he plays low Berkowitz will happily take +90. If he plays the 10 I think Berk will return the 9 giving EW a chance to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: which costs a tad more|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Few pre-empts are without risk, but that doesn't stop them from being effective, of course.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: So they did survive it, but South had to make a good guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding was well judged around the table.|pg||
nt|kit: defense in trouble now -- club shift difficult to find, and probably too late anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now rodwell has entry to dummy for misguess in @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|kit: Rodwell knows spades splitting, so setting that up first|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will probably punt with another diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: Contract will hinge on heart guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd jumps into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will likely misguess hearts due to Boyd's original pass -- provided Boyd defends passively|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: the 3 should be suit preference for clubs |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: if Robinson can conceal his AK of clubs, declarer might misjudge the strength and play him for queen of hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: then again maybe not|pg||
nt|kit: well, so much for that idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was good for a few seconds!|pg||
nt|kit: Becker knows Robinson would never be leading a heart from queen, so he should go up ace in case Boyd has stiff queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will of course also be broadcasting from the Spingold (and Wagar, women), starting on Wednesday with the Round of 32 in the Spingold|pg||
nt|kit: Admittedly difficult to construct a consistent distribution where Boyd has a stiff hearts, though|pg||
nt|brolucius: And East would have had to lead 3rd best from 4. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room, Becker led @H|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Now the defense pretty much can't get it wrong|pg||
nt|chorush: IMO all the evidence pointed to getting hearts wrong. I would have|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Boyd will get the heart count from his partner on 2nd round of hearts, so he will know not to duck.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|leo lasota: he may actually make 2 here with pettis pitching a spade.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson makes it easy for the defense.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd must know the whole hand now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: is anyone else surprised that Rodwell   a) bid 2@C opposite known 17-18   and/or b) rebid 2N instead of PASS 2@D|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest: anyone for Garbage Stayman here?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: should n bid 2c, planning to pass any response?|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can bid 2@C puppet, and get to 2@D|pg||
nt|swanson: IT is very considerate of the players to be giving us such a close match.  Many of the realy round matches were surprising runaways.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|joest: I would prefer to be playing 'regular Stayman' on this one|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, playing normal Stayman can and would have same auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: early|pg||
nt|swanson: This is an auction where it is almost never a winning action to balance.  Don't even look at your hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Cohler hates to sell to 2@D with a stiff diamond, but has no convenient way into the auction|pg||
nt|joest: and that's for the best!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: 2NT in other room, will fare a lot worse.|pg||
nt|joest: the hesitation suggests perhaps short diamonds in east and starting diamonds from the dummy|pg||

nt|brolucius: Call me psychic, but I think this deal will appear in the bulletin tomorrow.|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know -- after all, they didn't redouble|pg||
nt|chorush: I predict a contractof 6 hearts by North|pg||
mb|1N|nt|leo lasota: very nice fitting hands here for N/S.  South should make a slam try in hearts and of course North will accept with good 21.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|joest: well that's one way to approach it|pg||
nt|kit: This could lead to exactly the same result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson took his time before pasing.|pg||

nt|kit: 5@S by Spector, for sure, and Robinson will save in 6@C|pg||

nt|joest: bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector 1st seat PASS |pg||
nt|chorush: How many clubs?|pg||
nt|kit: 4 looks right to me|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Berkowitz will use Texas and RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: And it might be a good save, as it was in other room|pg||
nt|joest: then again there is always that fear of pushing them into a making slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker asks about the double.|pg||
nt|joest: but yes you gotta remove this|pg||
nt|kit: Double shows extra offense and defense, but still seems clear for Robinson to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: right you were|pg||
nt|kit: And Rodwell will take a possibly good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, he is subtracting from his partner's defense.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|joest: now spector with a double of his own|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see if RKCB is 4@s or 4N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S10 is rusinow...  may have a higher honor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: He will claim later that it is an obvious Lightner Double.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Spector pretty much has to double I would think -- and can becker find a heart lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boyd will be disappointed to learn that he has lost IMPs.|pg||
nt|kit: Wow -- so Spector saves 5 IMPs by not doubling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny way to gain/lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector sighs and shakes his head when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|joest: cheaper to take the save in 6@h :) -- which makes on a club lead|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson has to lead a trump to beat this|pg||
nt|chorush: Best kind of save is a make|pg||
nt|joest: two without?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: A lead I think is pretty obvious looking at his hand, but he thought otherwise.|pg||
nt|kit: Partner opened 1@D, he has majors bottled up -- where does declarer get tricks but trumps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set they had an even better sacrifice  6@CX making|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he could counter a trum by starting spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: chances are declarer will try to steal a trick before revealing his @ds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chorush: Only a trump lead keeps the contract from immediately being made, and I dont see that happening|pg||
nt|joest: low club gives it up at once|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|joest: well there's always the @CQ ira|pg||

nt|ritong: although, @c K(x) onside and he s home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [he'll correct me if i'm wrong]  Rusinow = 2nd of touching honors   so when Walter says higher honor that means a non-touching sequence of  AJT or KJT   not QJT, which would lead ...|pg||

mc|8|nt|vugraphzfc: berk: "Why didn't you show the queen?"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: You can only wonder if berk was holding his breath when he saw the ace diamonds hit the table.  Fortunately, Cohler had him covered.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: good question!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I did -- wait a minute -- oh..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Short break at the table.|pg||
nt|chorush: What I think happened is that Cohler is used to playing 4S as rkc and over that 5H would show 2 with the Q. Just a guess. Berkowitz and Cohler are not regular partners|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I believe you are correct Ira.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C, 10-15|pg||

nt|chorush: Hand is close to being worth 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: vul  7@S is common|pg||
nt|joest: some would respond 1@s as south, playing a "Walsh" type system|pg||

nt|brolucius: Very thoughtful of him to consider the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|joest: but it appears Spector treated as natural|pg||
nt|kit: seems like a shot to get to 3NT if partner bids it, planning on signing off at 4@S otherwise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Unfortunately, I cannot read the notes from here.|pg||
nt|joest: the fact that he is still thinking however is threatening to 'undull' this deal :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The Commentators' Curse strikes again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did think about 3@H as a no-trump problem, but it seems a bit risky. 4@S is the world's safest rebid.|pg||
nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||

nt|ritong: passing 4@c is not superclear|pg||
pc|dK|nt|joest: potential double fit; favorable vulnerability.  5@d seems auto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Cohler: "I hope you can take a joke."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is not a hand that favors the law of total tricks.  E/W can be held to 3 hearts, N/S can be held to 3 diamonds.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: That was a lot of thinking for a pass.|pg||
nt|joest: and if the club king were onside we'd be asking why he didn't bid it|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, they get to 4@S. No harm in entertaining us a bit along the way.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Landen is taking it all a bit seriously at the other table, rebidding 4@S.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|chorush: Certainly a vlaid point, but you could keep making his hand better with the same distribution til he had to do something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that doesn't sound right Larry -- a) equal level conversion may apply [so 5@C-5@D]  b) DBL gets left in a lot|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are unlikely to score three club tricks then.|pg||
nt|kit: right -- but he has 4|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Perhaps Berk can send this hand to Larry Cohen.  N/S have 10 card fit yet they make only 9 tricks; E?W had 11 card fit yet they only take 9 tricks as well.  :)|pg||
nt|chorush: 21 trumps, 18 tricks IS unusual, but its not the worst I have seen The LAW do|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Very true Ira|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It seems to me that Rodwell gets more than his fair share of "guesses" correctly.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: Some players lead the ace from 4, others the king. Both sets swear that their method is easily best.|pg||
nt|joest: I've never been sure when to lead the ace vs. the king in that system.  Maybe David can explain it.  He's written a book that covers it!|pg||
nt|kit: Good result for N-S in other room -- might not be duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Rodwell can, if he wishes, jump to 4H intheir system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24, 5@DX went down 2   i thought it had play for down 1, but still 6 imps for Spector|pg||
nt|joest: North-South rate to zoom to a spade game here and wrap it up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Meck was unable to support diamonds after a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: A very nice result for them.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which made life easier for North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both the DC and Florida districts have done very well in this event -- but Chip Martel and Northern California have best win record|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=LR @H|pg||
nt|chorush: getting conservative as he gets older|pg||
nt|kit: he has seen his partner's minimum opening bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was supposed to show 4-fit :(|pg||
nt|chorush: most experts play 2H as a constructive raise here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfc: Thumbs down on the spade raise from both sides of the screen.|pg||
nt|joest: well if that's so that is what I would bid with this hand b/c 2@s is reserved for horrible hands|pg||
nt|chorush: If NS do, the Cohler doesn't think his hand is constructive. I disagree|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Cohler has tough decision whether to show constructuve values or not; an ace and a king are very promising, but 34333 shape is not.|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect he showed nonconstructive or we would not be waiting for Berk's bid|pg||
nt|joest: well I play 2@h as constructive and believe me I would bid 2@s on so much less than this I couldn't afford to take the chance with 2@s|pg||
nt|chorush: I'm definitely with you Jack. 2S could be a 4-3-3-3 3count|pg||
nt|joest: "constructive" does not mean "limit raise"|pg||
nt|leo lasota: I agree with both of you, the constructive 2h raise would be my choice as well.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: and the 2@D raise makes North's 2@H call more competitive rather than constructive|pg||
nt|chorush: no, it just means a hand that if you compete with 3 spades later you wont be finding a Yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lee Trevino [and others]     The more I practice, the luckier I get|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|chorush: so much so that Meck has a maximum|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will have a second chance to lead his singleton club if he misses the first time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "Might only have three."|pg||
nt|ritong: fortunately larry cohen is not in the audience anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I guess there is a good reason he is playing and I'm doing the Vugraph. :)|pg||
nt|ritong: he is always sad when people are allowed to play 2@h peacefully|pg||
nt|ritong: even playing imps, even vulnerable|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: But he might not know what to play for|pg||
nt|ahollan1: max = any 6 or shape :)|pg||
nt|kit: However, this ends it quickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: well done|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kit: They still haven't made it, but looks like they will|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both Souths did well to raise the hearts on their moderate hand. Obviously the right move. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Provided robinson reads the lead as a singleton -- he should, since South marked with short spades.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Don't most people play 2@H as a one-round force here? If it isn't, then double|pg||
nt|kit: not clear whether to return a trump or a spade here -- probably spade, playing partner for Kx is best|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 3H was passing the buck|pg||
nt|joest: yeah well I don't like 3H for two reasons|pg||
nt|leo lasota: however, sometimes it is worth considering how aggressive your partner's bidding style is.  As we see, Berkowitz still made the aggressive game try so the game is still reached.|pg||
nt|joest:  1: you are torturing partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 57   Berkowitz 5@D West|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joest:  2: if partner gives you a slow 3@s you have an ethical night mare|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I really like reason  1 just on principle.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: I don't think most people play 2@H forcing|pg||
nt|joest: well I offered two just in case :)|pg||
nt|chorush: exactly Jack. Both very important points. IMO is 2 spades was not constructive, Cohler had the all-time quick 4 spade bid after the 3 club try|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|joest: I know I don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then you have to double|pg||
nt|kit: why?|pg||
nt|kit: if partner passes 2@H I'm probably high enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H constructive, but NF|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding you may want to compete against 2@D with quite a modest hand including fair hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play the same with no interference, Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: right -- here 2@H isn't necessarily so construcive|pg||
nt|kit: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: but as I said, here 2@H isn't necessarily constructive.  With no interference, it is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many bridge teachers say 'Change of suit forcing', but I have always thought that this is because it is much easier to teach! |pg||
nt|joest: out of comp, transfer advances can enter the picture (for some pairs) that makes things a bit easier|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, transfers are wonderful but little has been written about them.|pg||

mb|1C|nt|kit: A chance for Spector to tie the match if they can bid and make game -- both of which are big ifs|pg||
nt|brolucius: South missed out on his 2@C rebid, Roland (at the other table).|pg||
nt|kit: club from his hand doesn't make a difference|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: so, what should South rebid here?  3 possibilities at least|pg||

nt|ritong: borderline decision for palmer|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: He has been asked to write a book on that subject. He writes frequently in Bridge Magazine on the theoretical side of bidding.|pg||
nt|ritong: general strength and shape are not very appealing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Spector upgraded with the spade fit and got to the game.  Now he has to make it.|pg||
nt|joest: I think Brian SEnior devoted a chapter to it in his book "The Transfer Principle"|pg||
nt|joest: and Jeff Rubens has written about them off and on a while back in The Bridge World|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker takes a bit of a walk as dummy for the first time in this session (I think).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens wrote about them in the Bridge World, April 1981|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, that's excellent to bid the heart game. 3@H must have been bid on the partial spade fit. Well done.|pg||
nt|joest: wow " a while back" = 30 years.  I should have known.  :(|pg||
nt|kit: How should he play this?  Not clear at all.  Maybe just straight crossruff, which needs only queen of hearts onside or possibly a blockage|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell had to guess how many hearts and/or spades his partner had|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|leo lasota: 3 makes, albeit with a litle discomfort when diamonds do not come home for 5 tricks, from the North side.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: it appears he guessed wrong as both 2@H and 2@S probably down 1 -- but surely percentage action.|pg||
nt|ritong: but two aces and @cs with pard's opening are plusses|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: And it looks like the blockage works|pg||
nt|chorush: no, the did very well to right-side this although they had no way of knowing what the right side was|pg||
pc|c2|nt|leo lasota: Ax opp Qx "right side" is completely dependent on the holding of the opponent's cards.  Given that, it is still right in the long run to have the hand with Kx in spades playing the ...|pg||

nt|joest: but Jeff Meckstroth has never been timid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Time to put on some tea, David.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: 1NT might be pretty interesting I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David will be back in 10 minutes after he has had his shower. He always takes a shower when we display 1NT contracts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Your least favourite place to play.|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is obviously 100% forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Miles too late for tea, Ross. We are well and truly into the alcohol zone.|pg||
nt|kit: Rusinow leads and ace from AK vs. NT -- king would be power lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|joest: so it looks like king is the 'power lead' (i.e. unblock partner) which forces pairs to lead the queen from holdings like this (assuming one is going to lead an honor)|pg||
nt|joest: too fast kit|pg||
nt|kit: 6 is upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact I will go downstairs and put the remaining half of yesterday's bottle into the ice box. brb.|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell hoping his partner has a 2@S call instead of a 3@C call.  His prayers weren't answered.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N would show 2-places-to-play, so maybe that translates to 3@C = 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Robinson can deduce declarer doesn't have A10x, or he would not have ducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He puts cognac in the refrigerator?|pg||
nt|kit: And partner can't have Axx and play the 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Roland, the British have some strange notions.|pg||
nt|kit: So it was safe for him to continue with king of hearts -- he failed to work that out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I have noticed, Ross|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Sorry.  5 boards. :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: board 58  [2@HW-1]  Robinson in 3@D North|pg||
nt|ritong: contract is normal, with 26 hcp  looks like a battle of undertricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Many options for pettis to consider on this hand.|pg||
nt|ritong: given the layout|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told prayers are always answered -- but usually the answer is NO|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can continue diamonds and get a ruff with his 4 of clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: And the diamond shift gave declarer  7|pg||
nt|chorush: He will be doing well to make this, after he finds 4 spades in South he is likely to play North for diamond length|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler did well to stay off the diamond lead -- with only one trump|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: battle of undertricks     sounds like a title for .....  <fill in the blank>|pg||
nt|ritong: so, declarer is known with @c AQ and @s Q|pg||
nt|ritong: also, 4 @hs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: I heard that. It is the rest of the world that is strange. |pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should -- reason Robinson didn't lead heart was likely to be that he had the ace.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Yes, Cohler has hidden from pettis the nature of his distribution.  Unlikely that Pettis expects North to be 1714.  :)|pg||
nt|joest: no bidding; no singleton lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@cs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest: I think Pettis will need mirrors to make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There are mirrors in the room, but they are too high to see any other hand. :)|pg||
nt|chorush: play could also have been fascinating had Cohler led his diamond, After taking a ruff with the spade 9, he could not return a heart because that would give the trump show away|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: and presumably 2@s, but @s count is not 100% sure|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|leo lasota: Believe me, Pettis is certianly someone that I would like to have declare a hand like this. |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|joest: so down one|pg||
nt|leo lasota: Cohler was just too good on this hand, so Pettis will finish d1|pg||
nt|chorush: Mirrors will not avail him now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|joest: next door Jeff Meckstroth is at the wheel in 4@s doubled|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chorush: moment of truth coming. Rodwell may get it bcause |pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: can you still buy them wrapped in newspaper?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h9|nt|warrens:  a chance for a @S/@D squeeze if W had the J10 of @S (with the @H Q falling)|pg||

nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|ritong: cole has a jacks problem|pg||
nt|ritong: he can pitch a @s now, but the next discard will be difficult|pg||

nt|kit: yes Jack, a mis-discard at the end|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|swanson: Wouldn't the 7 (instead of the 6) be a bit easier for East to read?|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: a lot easier John -- I don't think the 6 is readable|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Robinson played the 4, giving his own encouraging signal|pg||
nt|joest: on the general theory that declarer must adopt the defender's signalling methods|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|kit: If Cohler does continue hearts, I think Robinson will have very good chances|pg||

nt|chorush: The doubler may survive to regret it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: walter   the correct spelling is OY|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Not suitable for Michaels. 1@H, perhaps?|pg||
nt|joest: I would agree.  disparity too great.|pg||
nt|joest: you'll bid hearts and then bid spades later, treating spades like a four card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Yes, 1@h.  I haven't put it up yet.|pg||
nt|chorush: 2D seems like a make to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Totally unsuitable for Michaels for various reasons in my view|pg||
nt|joest: Meckwell zoomed to 3NT next door -- which is not faring too well|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- other than Warren, who is upset that this match is so close|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: He had 8 facing a strong 1@C, so had to get to game.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C reasonable, but gives Rodwell another chance|pg||
nt|ritong: spector team likely ahead by 2 at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota: Would not surprise me if Meckwell try 4 hearts on the EW cards on this hand as well.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: meck gets another chance|pg||
nt|kit: big decision here -- I think he'll get it right|pg||
nt|larrymori: 3@s seems too little in a limited opener, 3@d? What do you guys think?|pg||
nt|chorush: If that Kx was naywhere else he would pass, but not spades|pg||
nt|chorush: I would have bid 3D, letting partner bid 3H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I'm waiting on  Boyd.  Meck bid 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = artificial game force  [2-way checkback]|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chorush: unfriendly lie of the cards here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: will take work to just go down one.|pg||
nt|joest: is cohler more likely to underlead the club ace or the QJ?|pg||
nt|chorush: low probability of either|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very low shot of either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East hand is now great, he wil think, with a singleton in South's suit. He can expect no wastage.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still has to make 3@H on 59 for that to occur|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: wonder if they would have stuck it out had Spector brought out the hammer :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't really. Boyd could have hearts stopped twice|pg||
nt|joest: i understand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if it does go 3@D-3@H   then what?|pg||
nt|kit: Good decision by Boyd|pg||
nt|chorush: I would make whatever my choice of games bid was;|pg||
nt|kit: his 5@C call far from obvious, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: much more likley to be robinson by 3|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|larrymori: then 3@s|pg||
nt|larrymori: the other choice was 4@s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: but still I wonder :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double might frighten them into a making club contract, from South's point of view.|pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
nt|leo lasota: This is one of those hands as declarer that you wonder if you think long enough, perhaps I can have the queen of hearts added in to my hand. :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|kit: Rodwell will have a plan upon seeing dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops forget they weren't vulnerable so likely robinson by 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: i never argue on decimals:)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: If declarer manages to make this, he may shunt the 6@C doubled contract off the front page of the bulletin.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|joest: stiff jack in south seemed more likely than stiff king in north.  I like Boyd's try there|pg||
nt|chorush: Rodwell going to defend this one quickly. Take first 3|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club, two shakes on the top diamonds and down one|pg||
nt|joest: two rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|chorush: He might be considering whether and how he could handle a stiff quack in north|pg||
nt|leo lasota: pettis still trying to imagine a miracle layout where he may make.  He may ruff club, cash AK diamonds, then play ace and king hearts hoping for QJ tight in the North hand.|pg||
nt|joest: yes. in fairness he is not giving up on making this|pg||
nt|joest: and if he plays a heart up, Cohler will split just to be sure and play will slow down further :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota: If South holds honor fourth in trumps and north has the stiff jack or queen, the hand cannot be made if we agree that spades are 42, with south having no more left.|pg||
nt|joest: and Meckwell has matched the contract again|pg||
nt|chorush: for a stiff quack based on what he has seen, North would be 4-1-3-5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Pettis apologizes for taking the time....|pg||
nt|chorush: and he can't handle that|pg||
nt|leo lasota: in which case north still has Jx spades and declarer will have one too many losers to avoid|pg||
nt|chorush: so he has to loook for doubleton QJ. that he CAN handle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 60 where Rodwell held 3N to down 1,  Robinson in 3N also, but Puppet Stayman auction concealed his @H length   Cohler led @HQ   now we wait|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were 'forced' into it after a strong club and Rodwell showed 5-7 with support|pg||

nt|chorush: Could Boyd have thought his pass was forcing?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: Surprise!  Meckwell reached 4@s in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think most players would raise the spades on that. Except strict followers of the Ron Klinger Losing Trick Count.|pg||
nt|kit: my rule is:  no aces + no kings + no singletons + no voids = no bid|pg||
nt|joest: = no fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held a doubleton club, the game would be OK.|pg||
nt|joest: defense would have to seriously awry to let this in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even without it hearts could come in for four tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Goren said you were supposed to lead 4th from longest & strongest, right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: well, if he had overcalled one heart he probably would be defending 3NT in the manner Leo described|pg||
nt|leo lasota: lead trumps against doubled partials, except when dummy has just 1 trump :)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure -100 will be a disaster|pg||
nt|joest: this is the 'standard' lead off this auction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Suppose you pass and West re-opens with a double. You might be worried bidding just 2@S then, with 6 points (albeit ropey ones) and 3-card support.  I prefer to bid straight away ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with a weak hand and then fold up my cards (ahem).|pg||

nt|ritong: playing south for H10, twice more likely than KQ|pg||

nt|ritong: south overcalled, but was a passed hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: after no club lead, declarer has a real chance.  He plays on hearts, and what does North do?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he showed his hand and right or wrong it seems like Robinson has to double or bid 5@s|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|kit: There is no right or wrong answer to the question of whether Boyd's pass is forcing.  The important thing is for partnerships to have firm and unambiguous rules, and follow them.|pg||
nt|joest: now there can be some serious damage|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 300 if they take ruffs|pg||
nt|joest: Cohler coudl be afraid he is dealing partner ruffs withnatural trump tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT would likely have had a better chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with @DJ onside|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift allows this to make|pg||
nt|kit: so does ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: either a passive heart or underleading the diamond needed|pg||
nt|joest: definitely not easy|pg||
nt|kit: heart exit is okay I think|pg||
nt|kit: and of course low diamond is most successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK certainly looks attractive, though. He will do well to avoid it.|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room south got a diamond raise in (from where?) but here no bidding from south|pg||

nt|joest: that leaves the 'agricultural' 3NT call i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: on board 60 it was a correct claim of 3nt making|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: we believe you operator.  WE just don't know how|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n by east down on h lead, but 3n by west should make|pg||

nt|kit: big chance for swing here -- 5@C cold, as is 3NT by West|pg||
nt|joest: maybe 3@c should be forcing |pg||
nt|joest: this hand would talk me into it|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: wrong-sided now|pg||
nt|wygbe1: uh oh, wrongsided nt|pg||
nt|kit: And I would expect Boyd to choose his stronger suit to lead|pg||
nt|joest: of course 3@c now is forcing but it suggests spade shortness.  Berkowitz with an impossible bidding problem in standard (imho)|pg||
nt|kit: unless 2@H was real|pg||
nt|swanson: Tough for South to find a heart lead, expecting four hearts at his left.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|joest: berkowitz hopes his 2@h call at least served to ward off a heart lead|pg||

nt|kit: yes -- 3 double figure swings vs. 0, and match still very close|pg||
nt|chorush: If your partnership has a rule that there are no preempts over preempts, then maybe 4 spades should do the trick|pg||
nt|kit: there must be strict rules which cover this auction (and others)|pg||
nt|joest: yes they did have 800 coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: There will be some post-mortems on that one -- on both sides, I think.|pg||
nt|chorush: Incidentally, are their more 1H overcallers than doublers here?|pg||
nt|joest: a very close and exciting match all the way so far|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, 17+ bal|pg||
nt|kit: that is my rule -- 4@S not a preempt over a preempt, therefore bid to make voluntarily, therefore in force.  But I'm not guessing.  |pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 1@h i confess|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As we were all saying.... an excellent raise by East on the first round!|pg||
nt|chorush: I would also|pg||
nt|leo lasota: another discussion to be made with all partnerships is if you play equal level conversion doubles with 4 spades and 5 hearts.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 62, Boyd did NOT bid with Meck's hand   will Berkowitz-Cohler find 5@C now?|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|kit: Lucky slam here -- they won't get there after this start I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Meck will be more interested if partner has stiff club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C does ASK|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: What does 6+4+2 come to?|pg||
nt|kit: Should Becker open 1@S or 2@C?  Not clear to me.|pg||
nt|joest: partner could have spade queen, diamond queen, heart ace|pg||
nt|joest: but those values are hard to locate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=4441@D|pg||
nt|kit: do they play rkc relay here?|pg||
nt|kit: I guess not needed -- Meckstroth can just set trumps with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure how DBL changes things -- but I bet it gives Meck MORE room|pg||
nt|joest: landen surprised tohear hearts bid at his left for sure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = asking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: choose not to ask|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT serious slam try|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i don't think Becker is passing|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he might move now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I open 1@S. It gets too messy after 2@C with 6-4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL, i think after 3@D   4@C=RKC @H  4@D=RKC @S|pg||
nt|kit: Even with king of diamonds wasted Meckstroth can still picture possible perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder why he bid 3@H?  There clearly can be no value to playing 4-4 fit opposite the 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|chorush: Picturing perfectos can be an expensive experience. Hamman says "If you need the perfect hand, I don't have it"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without DBL  3@H is a RELAY [not setting trump]   with DBL, we need Walter|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps to set up a RKC for hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod writing a lot of explanation to Robinson.|pg||
nt|joest: now Cohler would like to bid 2@c natural|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at some point, Rod describes strength of hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota: extremely unfriendly hand to declare for either side.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: blackwood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3keys|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: notwithstanding the breaks, you can get a lot of mileage in 2@c north-south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Thanks....I think."|pg||
nt|joest: where does he start? :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I have no clue. the only thing he probably likes about Coh;er's hand is the spade 9|pg||
nt|joest: and if he works diamonds, the jack will be an ominous sign|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|kit: So he will bid the slam|pg||
nt|joest: yes they are still mid auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: but if he asks about the trump queen, they might still hang short|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double surely means that West has the @DA and South has the @HA.|pg||
nt|kit: but partner might have xxxx of spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @HA is not such a good card, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: the double surely means only 1 diamond loser|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K ask|pg||
mb|5S|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true.|pg||
nt|joest: he may duck this|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: club 8 will eventually score|pg||
nt|leo lasota: queen clubs out of hand trick 2 would be my choice.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Becker thinks: '2-2 break at worst'.|pg||
nt|leo lasota: and it would be berk's choice as well. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: You are in good company. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yeah.  + partner might table Jxx or spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: So many IMPs riding on the lie of the cards. |pg||
nt|kit: good perecentage bid by Becker.  Unlucky about the double of 5@D.  Without that, I think Becker would have asked for queen of trumps and stopped.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea what Rod said with DBL -- but they did nice job of stopping at 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rod: "trying to show some extras."|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Meck: "This won't take long."|pg||
nt|leo lasota: landen has high hopes that his partner holds Jx in diamonds.  Unfortunately for him, berk has the second diamond, not pettis.|pg||
nt|chorush: this feels like if they offered Berk down 2 he would accept it|pg||
nt|joest: i know i would|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S = 1K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems counterintuitve for the hand with a void to be asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only Walter can explain what Meck's other options were|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: Yes. It was very helpful for Meckstroth to know that Rodwell was specifically 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Berk: "Amazing." -- when he sees the @c split.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, is 3NT a serious try?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, I see, you said so before, thanks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: they bid 6@s in the other room as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D doubled at the other table too...|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least it is fair if both teams bid (or do not bid) such a slam.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Becker shows his hand:  "Do the spades break?"|pg||
nt|kit: Note the clear victory for playing 0314 as opposed to 1430 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it;s usual for 3@S to be bid as an ask|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: It surprises me that Becker did not ask for @SQ|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chorush: this is a hand where whoever is on lead wishes he were not|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true ira|pg||
nt|joest: i have a highconfidence level the ten of hearts comes next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't ever remember not usinf it before cuebidding...  maybe 3NT shows short @S with slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 3 IMPs difference now.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that would be consistent with other sytem structures|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, boyd had a choice of leads and got it wrong|pg||

nt|chorush: he is gonna come close to making this|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, someone ordered an electric storm over this table|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D fineese followed by a @S back breaks squeezes up|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|leo lasota: 8 clubs here|pg||
nt|leo lasota: true def has a counter for that|pg||
nt|ritong: real tough switch|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  more for communication to set up @D|pg||
nt|ritong: the only information he has is the @h length  perhaps some inferences|pg||
nt|warrens:  Club back and he ruffs out @D's to make.  @S back and it's over|pg||
nt|loe48: 2 times club and draw 1 heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson also in 6@H   looks like after cue-bidding then RKC from NORTH    Cohler finally leads .... trump|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Ross, our excellent operator in Toronto. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's right.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Great work, Ross!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, David, Jack and Kit|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks to start 1@d-1NT-2@h|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|joest: now that surprises me|pg||
nt|joest: pass risks a double part score swing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chorush: well he does have a stiff where partner opened but I hate to sell|pg||
nt|leo lasota: would not bid 2h at unfav with singleton in partner's openiong suit.  Very lucky that partner happens to have K10x of hearts this time, but there are many other holdings where you ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota: may go for a big number.|pg||
nt|joest: your hand can get sealed off in 1NT and add five tricks or so to the pot in 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yeah well life is a risk |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C  as before   2@D=bal 8-10, no 5+ suit  3N=signoff|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Steve doesn't see it my way :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: We will be back after a short break, perhaps 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Thanks.  I've had a great time.|pg||
nt|kit: Spade lead would be quite successful here -- should South overcall 2@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We should not let the last hand go without noting that a double of a Blackwood 5@D response on the @DA is not necessarily a wise move. You can see how it helped North here, at both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: tables. It is different when you double a cue-bid with a high card sitting over the cue-bidder's high card.|pg||
nt|joest: a spade lead gives this a rough ride|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like routine 3NT headed down 1.|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not -- Robinson has 109 of spades, so he will be under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|chorush: After a heart lead this is no gimme|pg||
nt|ritong: rodwell probably likes this auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chorush: Robinson not only has the 109 of spades but also the only diamond guard|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: So heart lead, win, lose club hook, continue hearts, win, run clubs.  Robinson pitches 1 diamond, and then what?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: or even a heart lead and spade shift.  But difficult to fault club lead when hitting partner with just ace of clubs can be instant set.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|leo lasota: very true, but if the likely gain from bidding may be a double partial swing, while the downside is a potential telephone number, pass seems right.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|kit: Declarer will still have to sweat North having ace of hearts since the spades will block, but all is well.|pg||
nt|joest: other room: heart lead + spade shift|pg||
nt|joest: that is unweighted for frequency|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: ok thanks all|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Ross.  Great job!|pg||

nt|leo lasota: Ross :)|pg||
nt|chorush: thanks all. the fourth quarter looks like a real barn burner. We should resume in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It's OK, Leo -- I've been called worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 2 IMPs difference (if the scores are correct).  Don't change the channel.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's pretty loud suit preference @C4  and Cole obliges|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chorush: so I think this hand is makeable but needs some guessing|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: I will certainly be back when the Spingold starts on Wednesday - one of the best events of the year.|pg||
nt|kit: Bud will Rodwell play for this, or play Boyd for Kx of spades?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe somebody on site can scope out scores in the LM Pairs|pg||
nt|kit: Now spade to jack, and when honor appears he will rethink.|pg||
nt|kit: I would expect he will get it right and play for this layout.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to play on spades to have any chance, so spade hook must be on.|pg||
nt|chorush: Robinson would always play spade 9 or 10 from 109xx so there is a guess involved|pg||
nt|kit: right -- Robinson might have started with 109xx, QJxxx, Jx, Kx and discarded exactly the same way.|pg||
nt|chorush: Would you cash the diamond ace to see if, perhaps the diamond K has been blanked?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- spade hook first, then diamond to ace|pg||
nt|kit: spade hook always a must|pg||
nt|chorush: right, that will occur anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: however, 4@h is not cold|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: As pointed out, Robinson would (should!) always falsecard from the remaining holding of 109x, so 9 of spades not necessarily honest|pg||
nt|kit: He knows (or can assume) Robinson has the 10, but that doesn't solve the problem.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 30 [our 5@D-4]   Becker playing a quiet 4@S EAST  after an unusual vs unusual auction|pg||
nt|chorush: Note that Boyd played the spade 6 and kept the 2, perhaps trying to influence Rodwell that Robinson was retaining the 2|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Robinson doesn't have to have king of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell gunts in frustration and dives back into the think-tank.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which gets us to      this is now a 34 board matcch|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson's jack of diamonds might have been his last diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Rodwell: "Feels like a coin toss."|pg||
nt|kit: so Rodwell doesn't have the count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Boyd: "Canadian or American."|pg||
nt|kit: he has the heart count, yes, but that isn't enough to tell him the shape|pg||
