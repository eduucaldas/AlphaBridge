pc|d7|nt|eleni: I am sorry 3rd round|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet 3NT for starter|pg||
nt|gmarco24: if my counting is good, this will be 500 for EW|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract will go for 500, EW might make slam but it will likely be against their game. that is, if they rightside 3nt because it might go down if played by east|pg||
nt|arigun: 6 icin|pg||
nt|kaapo: A quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco might have promised stronger hand than this with his bidding, or might be just normal youngsters friskines on both parties|pg||
nt|bebechira: but they need a good win now if they want to chalenge Israel....good for moral as well|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry, choæ w Polsce ma³o pogodny:)|pg||

pc|sK|nt|bmkl: however not the same lead|pg||
nt|lady007: in the other room east foresaw that problem and raised the 1@s response over his 1@c opening to 2@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Good switch not giving declarer a chance to make:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|liraren: i dont know anything about the danish pair , but the swedish pair have done well in matchpoint , lets see how good they are in IMP|pg||
nt|rado: declarer might produce 9 tricks but brobably defence will be 1st with 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: E playing 1NT in the open room....|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we will start with a swing...|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand young superstar Madala is playing, who has played almost every round of the tournament|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: NS look to have over bid here but Greek NS in 4@sx in OR  so France will gain even if 4@h going down|pg||

nt|runnerup: a little suprice that ns didnt bid 5 @d|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|frankbo: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, a bit passive|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of work for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|zebutin: now declarer seems to have 2@D+2@S+3@C+@H eventually, and then opponents have setting trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be too much work :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ybob: now @H to discard later @D|pg||
nt|bagman: Kytömaa's opening was a bit on the light side considering the position and vulnerability but he's not going to be badly punished|pg||
nt|runnerup: so there was one good point from east activeness -there are in -bad point is that this is -1 -still can no big lost |pg||

nt|lady007: 1N did seem to go down, but i cant blame him for bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which suggests north has to x with that hand perhaps|pg||
nt|stevedr: 2diamonds shows a positive hand|pg||

nt|daman: a  @D will let him make|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|tejjyid: I assume West's 4@S is fast arrival, showing his distaste for thesoft @C cards|pg||

nt|runnerup: this could be the first pass ..i have seen ...:)|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this is it -ew must let declare take 1 @c trick 2. perhaps and some 2-down -east has no entry otherwise,but not easy for west to lead that|pg||
nt|daman: @D9 = 0 or 2 higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pass by S should show some interest in bidding ON -- with no interest he should have bid 3S immediately |pg||
nt|offthebend: and they have arrived in the right game contract |pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe 2@h could be brought home by EW|pg||
nt|lady007: yes, maybe. The Dutch EW are going to try that now :)|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  1NT ?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  should have bid 1NT before, testing EW agreements (dbl = support or not)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: right, most people say "negative doubles to X level" and then move on to something interesting|pg||

nt|juan lukas: pass is the only way to get a + score, even with 25HCP in NS |pg||
nt|ybob: nice guess |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, it seems a good view... don't think I could find it...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4m is 1 down with a @s lead which seems normal after their bids |pg||
nt|kaapo: She knows her side has some fit but her partner might think she's stronger if she acts|pg||
nt|panosk: E unbloched the 10@S 1st round of spades so dummy spades were good, only 1 entry needed then|pg||
nt|daman: good bid by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@H is makable but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|chrisky: if the A@s was in north then the best lead to deffeat the contract....:)|pg||
nt|lady007: vd Bos will be happy with the spade lead when he sees dummy but the queen wont stand up|pg||
nt|gmarco24: the word what you looking for is "i wish" instead of maybe  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: i wish? i dont wish the swedish EW bid 4S at all :)|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@s might go down on a club lead and ruff later on though|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead from N? i might prefer passive @S|pg||
nt|zebutin: @D pictures most likely behind declarer, Jx doesn't look promising, and A10x isnt going anywhere...|pg||
nt|zebutin: or thats my thinking on lead anyway :)|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  easy contract this|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  even I could make|pg||
nt|ritong: here, north has to bid 2@s as soon as he has nothing else available, possibly with 5 cards  so, 3@s should show 6 decent cards in a pleasant hand|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, here bob drijver has much more than that|pg||
nt|gmarco24: it doesn't make, right?|pg||
nt|runnerup: @d played with 4-2 fit ew in other table --so both rooms in 2 @d|pg||
nt|friggi: what would @H overcall mean according to their system?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to win this and play back a low club to the J|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not a very interesting contract at 1NT. Some North's might bid Satyman and play somewhere else|pg||
nt|bagman: he might have ducked the diamond as the lead suggests 5-2 but the spades might be even more vulnerable than the diamonds|pg||
nt|zebutin: they landed in 3nt on previous board, so Finland takes the early lead...|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  She knows that partner doesnt have extras and 3@h|pg||
nt|friggi: 1@H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, I believe EW use 3rd/5th leads so @D2 is usually from 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahri:  Hello everyone, I'm Tomislav and I'll help comment here a bit! :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, the nub is what does the neg X guarantee - if it's around 5/6 HCP then 3@S can't be GF|pg||
nt|liraren: i do agree|pg||
nt|lady007: if they dont get a ruff, 1 heart, 1 spade and a diamond loser?|pg||
nt|tez: 11 puanla þlem daveti bile yapmadý..ortakta iyi bir 22 bile olmaz diye düþündü|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|bmkl: 3@c seems to be puppet|pg||
nt|eleni: yes and then smolen|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H you most likely hit partners major suit, but he can't have too much points when you have 10...|pg||
nt|zebutin: but could work out with some combinations|pg||
nt|runnerup: he showed length -ok i see -high from 3 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tez: @h küçük çýkýlabilirdi|pg||

nt|juan lukas: 9 imps for france probably after the @h switch |pg||
nt|arigun: veya @D|pg||
nt|zebutin: so @D honor lead in other room and small @D here, no love for majors :(|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested @D 9 continuation|pg||
nt|zebutin: which would be really sneaky|pg||
nt|bebechira: France has 4 tricks..so another imp on the way|pg||
nt|lechcold: rozdanie nieoczywiste dla obu stron|pg||
nt|panosk: 7 wud do the trick too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ntmon: rise with @DA, @C, and ruff a @C |pg||

pc|c3|nt|galois85: 1@s is double without majors?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1@s is trf to 1Nt with bal or weak with a minor|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gmarco24: well, lead a club  :)))|pg||

pc|c5|pg||

nt|frankbo: thk he makes now|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok 180 -so 3 for F|pg||
nt|frankbo: thk he should see that cl was not good there|pg||
nt|sybarra2: they need to right the ship |pg||
nt|sybarra2: maybe beginning|pg||
nt|loe48: kan se ut som om meldingen her ogsaa er preget av en dose tran for mye|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahri:  south trying to figure out if east can have 9 tricks if he lets down a heart|pg||
nt|eleni: oh!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eugenio123: small @d is not a bad lead he just hope  find 2 cards from his partner, but this time he's been unlucky|pg||
nt|ahri:  and he decided that east will need at least one spade trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@S would have gone down so missed chance to push opps there|pg||
nt|zebutin: but then J could cover, if singelton honor takes it 654 against H3 is enough|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: -2 next|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|possessed: indeed he guessed well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eugenio123: he knows that with @d lead they would be blocked |pg||
nt|eleni: now North is squeezed and he may or may not part with a @c|pg||
nt|bmkl: North has to decide whether he guards @ds or @cs (or both)|pg||
nt|eleni: a @d discard from dummy won't hurt any at this moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the neg X min is 8/9 then I think 3@S can beGF, which makes life simpler|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bagman: nothing fancy in the end: declarer likely to make his 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: to play @c was like surrender here i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: doðu sýkýþacak|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yusufb: atak bulamadý|pg||
nt|tez: iyi oluyor boyle cengiz..seyirciler mutlu oluyor biz bilemeyince:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: I also play like that. Trouble with the method is that with 4-4 in the majors it's easy to lose the @S fit, especially if opponents interfere like this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ntmon: nice guess in @H suit|pg||
nt|ahri:  north didn't have a problem as south returned high heart to show spades|pg||
nt|mamos: another safe board for EW   |pg||

nt|possessed: 5cl seems cold, but lets see if they can bid|pg||
nt|ntmon: hard to reach  |pg||
nt|tejjyid: "6 decent cards in a pleasant hand" is a good description (probably not acceptable in the ACBL)|pg||
nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|offthebend: only 3 imps tho - deserve more than that |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  only 3 imps, but it should have been 5 for denmark|pg||
nt|timve:  hello all|pg||
nt|lady007: hi Tim|pg||
nt|gmarco24: welcome Tim|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 2 was played in 4 spades making all 22 times|pg||
nt|juan lukas: with 16 HCP and stiff @s ,  would have doubled for sure so no finesse against J @s |pg||
nt|ybob: S showed A@S KJ @H A@D and K@C, with A@S stiff not bid pass over 3@S|pg||
nt|runnerup: wery good result for F in open here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  or some FG hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is 15+9 balanced hands worth game?|pg||

nt|daman: Hungary needs action to move up in the standings (or down )|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kjapp eg og. -3|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ryskiel_: niewa¿ne - ale puszczenie lewy w oczywistej sytuacji chwa³y nie przynosi|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: 2@d by south I guess|pg||
nt|ahri:  (almost) misfit distributive hands, this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  East was squeezed on  3 - nice play by Giampetro on that one|pg||
nt|ritong: south has to invite|pg||
nt|ritong: a natural 2NT seems to match his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it'sa whole lot of losers, but too many points to do less|pg||
nt|tejjyid: great bid,the natural 2NT|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3NT easy for N-S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might end in 3NT here; down with a spade lead and make if declarer can get 9th trick from diamonds in time|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eleni: bad distributions:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  it all depends on how do you agree what 3@h is here. some play it forcing, some play it constructive NF, I don't find any of those "wrong" :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our open table is really taking its time:)|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c is GF relay|pg||
nt|lady007: wild board|pg||

nt|arigun: ne dersin yusuf ? :)|pg||
nt|stevedr: 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: an over-ambituous 3NT:(|pg||
nt|ahri:  west is quite aggressive and unpredictable. I know that best, he's my ex partner :)|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 minor nS|pg||
nt|liraren: double fit for both pairs now maybee some action|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  denmark have started off badly in this tournament, but they are in top5 now, thanks to a huge win over the netherlands|pg||
nt|offthebend: poor bidding led to poor play also and a slight jutice in favour of sweden I would say |pg||
nt|lady007: I expect west to come in with 2@h|pg||
nt|dkkello: Denmark with a great oppertunity here|pg||
nt|ybob: clear slam |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  U have the same problem if u bid 1@h nat and opps bid 3@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: With 4-4 you can double using standard methods|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open|pg||
nt|bagman: 15-17 + 9 is always a game|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt forcing 2@d|pg||
nt|daman: and Italy need a win|pg||
mb|2S|nt|possessed: 2d is- 20-22 with a five card suit?|pg||
nt|ntmon: as Roland uses to say, @C suit died in 50-ties|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 2 only Romania in closed room bid and made 6c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: probaly 21C Michael's or Ghestemish - both majors |pg||
nt|eleni: a tricky lead of small !g can keep them off slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East  not wanting to be excluded lol|pg||
nt|eleni: !g|pg||
nt|eleni: THX Todor dear for the explanations:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but east should have taken @DA earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: after the @c lead, is a claimer|pg||
nt|lady007: seems like NS are back on natural bidding now, after the overcall |pg||
nt|timve:  3NT by south?|pg||
nt|lady007: Wouldnt 3@d show 5/5 now?|pg||
nt|timve:  I think so|pg||
nt|lady007: not sure i want to play 3N with the south hand then|pg||
nt|timve:  but in diamonds you know the wrong hand will play|pg||
nt|arigun: guney tarafinda @d atagini 9 lu ezilirse aliriz defans 3@d+1@h alir ezmezse boslariz |pg||
nt|zebutin: really wd for romania then|pg||
nt|runnerup: south counting if a slam can exist|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: everyone cuebidding :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: good bid by s|pg||
nt|chrisky: it promisses fit in @D|pg||
nt|eleni: it's simply indicative:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps 3NT has the same meaning in modern sytems|pg||
nt|lady007: he might bid 4C now, and if N doesnt support, bid 5@d later|pg||
nt|timve:  would you go for 5@C?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes indeed, East hand strong after the 2 heart response|pg||
nt|ybob: on OR 2NT rebids showed 5/4 strong, 4@C was cue with @H fit from W and not clear to E |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Tofte takes appropriate action|pg||
nt|yusufb: :)|pg||
nt|rado: strange to buy contract at 2@D at other room|pg||
nt|jaheim: tipper vest tenker på 2 nt|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pinticus: 2@d weak 6M or strong minor or strong balanced|pg||
nt|liraren: if right guess in @d they make 4@s|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  not on @d lead|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  or switch|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N it is|pg||
nt|juan lukas: maybe 4@c then 5@h would have been clearer in the other room |pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@c forcing 2@d*|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2@s=4@h|pg||
nt|kaapo: This looks like puppet stayman|pg||

mb|p|nt|vasmar: defense can get 3 tricks|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@c gazzilli 2@d 8+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 4@S looks normal here unless West falls too deeply in love with the void|pg||
nt|runnerup: nothing special here -10 now and + some|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eugenio123: I don't like pass by south, it gives opps too much room to bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pinticus: 2@h pass or correct|pg||

nt|galois85: 2@h means " all was natural"|pg||
nt|veistikke:  much imps for sweden|pg||
nt|rodal f: Har E til 4 nå?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: all in one..|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt 21-23 bal|pg||
nt|liraren: but i cant see why Tofte should guess right in @d|pg||
nt|lady007: 9 tricks are no problem on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pinticus: 2nt=min no 4@h|pg||
mb|4C|nt|liraren: but not with @d in trick 2|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E guesses the D position , 4S can be made -- losing 2S and a H but DQ switch , he can get a D ruff for one down |pg||
nt|liraren: i am told by spec :)|pg||
nt|timve:  think 3NT is pretty practical, but always easy seeing all the four hands|pg||
nt|zebutin: what to lead?|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it is known dummy doesn't have 4 spades but declarer well might have|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for france|pg||
nt|zebutin: needs to quess @H right to have any chance at this... when J or Q drops its much better odz that  Rubino has other honor...but then you are always losing 1 @H trick|pg||
nt|panosk: y matter of overtrics now, he shudnt try for too many :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR enda 3@CN|pg||
mb|p|nt|possessed: Turkey will take the lead after this|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 4@C its clear to @H fit, W could bid 3@S with @S fit over 3@H ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so well done|pg||
nt|galois85: and 4@s is FG |pg||
nt|kaapo: A spade doesn't look very appetizing|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can now get 3 club tricks without losing one with the right guess|pg||
nt|bagman: with 4 hearts and 2 spades, that's 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Other table at 2 so someone is going to win on this one, probably Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: The nicety with 3rd best leads is that W knows that the suit is now blown |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer plays low and there's no good move for W|pg||
nt|jkotor: ta jest panie komendancie !|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: When was the Häxan convention invented, Johan, do you know?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Was it before or after Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if defence would have started with 3 @D rounds, then 5 @H tricks would maybe have been enough|pg||
nt|loe48: ja det var nok ventet..saa det er ikke helt bra utvikling naa|pg||
nt|jaheim: i nord??  på 2-1?|pg||

pc|s7|nt|eleni: French courtesy to pd:) Lorenzini is a young gentleman:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: turkey reached the optimmal contract, well deserved IMPs|pg||
nt|lady007: it is actually bad news for gullberg that his partner had the jack of hearts, because it means they can set up the suit by playing it only once through declarer|pg||
nt|runnerup: if this makes 4 @s seems good idea from ew -but  they were never inn bidding|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  No after  i think|pg||

nt|sybarra: a bit over the top! |pg||

nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested passing 1@S|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ritong: the downside is you can get excommunicado for not playing spliçnters|pg||
nt|tejjyid: definitely; to be balanced agaisnt the fact that I think splinters are slightly more frequent (but purely intuition, no statistics)|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, fitjumps allow to show lengthes, then controls if needed  the contrary is not true|pg||

nt|cicus: the probability you have a splinter in a 3rd suit is not very big|pg||
nt|liraren: yep i think u can use the jump to 4@d as fitjump , |pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe he wants to make it harder for EW to balance|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, West might down-value the @SK - but it's difficult to convince East you haven't got an opening hand after you've opened|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W might sacrefise in 4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to land in 4 @H here |pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has chances -best defence baets but can be home if best not found|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sky being 12.|pg||

nt|kaapo: This may not be a good way to do it, either|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 imps saved |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ntmon: partscores in both directions in their respective 9-card fits|pg||
nt|cicus: even now, @HA and @SQ would be damaging|pg||
nt|offthebend: basically HQ on side is needed for 4H to make and 3-2 split -- failing which some minor suit squeeze may develop against W who has made a T/O double |pg||

pc|h5|nt|key1809: 2D=looked like a TRF,and accepting the TRF meant as 4, i guess, as we play the same:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know this convention, thx for your explaination|pg||
nt|key1809: 2C=FG,checkback, and 2D/H=TRF|pg||
nt|key1809: ok, might be 2D as FG relay as a spec suggested|pg||
nt|eugenio123: north doesn't have an easy lead, he doesn't know it would change nothing|pg||
nt|key1809: but all roads lead to Rome|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  we have seen the converse - 1@S = 0-3@S otherwise dbl|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but why not 2@C????|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@C in board 6 worked for a 3 imps gain|pg||
nt|dkkello: both of the french players were on the french team winning the worlds championship in Bejing |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 spades has chances it seems..|pg||
nt|yusufb: cok tehlikeli X bunlar|pg||
nt|kaapo: "antti è un nome maschile o femminile?" they ask in the open room. Without knowing any Italian my answer was "maschile"|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S lead looks like a good start for defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be difficult to stay out of 4 |pg||
nt|panosk: no a great hand south's but rule of 15 says open it|pg||
nt|jaheim: rundt 14 stikk i hj|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahri:  NS pushing their luck again|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  perhaps this is the "hey I can use a convention" bid|pg||
nt|ybob: no with good defence|pg||
nt|yusufb: fazla anlaþmalarý yok olanlar bile buralarda fire verirken|pg||
nt|runnerup: all tricks here if no save thing coming |pg||
mb|2H|nt|_fonzie__:  that must only be true up to a certain level|pg||
nt|liraren: north is too passive I would have overcalled 2@c|pg||
nt|arigun: @DAK baslarsa defan durum sakat tabii|pg||
nt|tez: @d as atak edirse..ki edilir ..sonrasýný iyi ayarlamak lazým|pg||
nt|stevedr: altough i would be tempted to double with the east hand|pg||
nt|panosk: drury?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: let's see how accurate defence will be|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@C making|pg||
nt|ritong: so, when pard has a violent two suiter it is a good initiative to bid 1Nt|pg||
nt|cicus: now if 2@C was @Cs or extras, 2@S must be very weak so N should pass|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli like 2@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If he takes off his shoes to count his points, 1NT looks better|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  2@c? with that pile of rubbish?|pg||
nt|timve:  hmm 3NT is an interesting contract|pg||
nt|arigun: bakalim 3@h yapabilecek mi .9|pg||
nt|famus: first sign of  cheer for Danish fans with Italy going down in 4@S-- the declarer there lost trump control on a @H lead--he played !A and back-Danish yougster--took both @S and ...|pg||
nt|famus: forced a @h ruff|pg||
nt|bambik: widac ze Fisher nie czuje leku przed licytacja|pg||
mb|4H|nt|liraren: good suit |pg||
nt|lady007: 3@h on the south cards, with 4432 and no aces, doesnt look great. but you obviously have too much for 2@h and you have to bid something|pg||
nt|gmarco24: yes, we were afraid at the first sight. later we realized that their girls are much better players  :P|pg||
nt|lady007: 4@h on the other hand just looks too much |pg||
nt|lady007: lol|pg||
nt|timve:  but well |pg||
nt|timve:  west forgot to lead his @CA |pg||
nt|timve:  think its now always made|pg||
nt|lady007: they are in 4|pg||
nt|timve:  oh wait|pg||
nt|timve:  hearts 41|pg||
nt|lady007: dont you always lose 2 clubs and 2 diamonds?|pg||
nt|timve:  also that|pg||
nt|lady007: this will be 50 per trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: suprice lead and 7 first -@d and ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: There was called TD about previous board |pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: 4@D was made with hesitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: how to stop south? lol|pg||
nt|key1809: South know,knows 5-5, but a meagre 3card H support,will not allow him to stretch more than 4h|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS really bid what they have :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: won't be my choice of Overcalls either :) tho it may cost |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  i wouldnt even think of overcalling this hand; QJTxx is far from being a good suit|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  and only defensive values|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes I agree -- then S shd have taken some action |pg||
nt|offthebend: sry -- that comment was about previous hand |pg||
nt|liraren: its a bidders game , and i like to bid first and dont have get back in too the bidding in higher levels|pg||
nt|famus: cards well placed for an over trick|pg||
nt|liujing: I wonder whether the best line is to draw only 1 trump with A|pg||
nt|liujing: and play @C AK|pg||
nt|liujing: can afford any 4-1 break in black suits|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobry wist na -1|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|kaapo: EW play mini NT when vulnerable so West has max 9 HCP|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good stop:)|pg||
nt|stevedr: winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|stevedr: they need to hear, good stop, wins 15 :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: delikatnie to powiedzia³e Apku|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: but his partner bid @d twice without AK10 so probably has very good @h|pg||
nt|key1809: whats the agreed suit is the question, North wd be asking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems they're playing in @d|pg||
nt|yusufb: koz oynarsa|pg||
nt|tez: defans en zor yeri briçin..en zevklisi ayný zamanda|pg||
nt|yusufb: batar bence|pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make this for a 5 IMP gain for Finland|pg||
nt|veistikke:  haha|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D kanskje alerted|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yusufb: sacma bi iþ yaptý|pg||
nt|panosk: with what spades ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: opening bids and overcalls are getting Lighter and lighter by the day |pg||
nt|juan lukas: W can overruff the 3rd round in @h |pg||
nt|dkkello: @C Q  now |pg||
nt|liujing: can this line be improved in bd6|pg||
nt|kaapo: De Leo might have a better chance for the contract than Madala in the OR|pg||
mb|6H|nt|key1809: i wd have prefered a Jump of 4C, on 2H, as fit raise,If north can pick up from there...|pg||
nt|ntmon: now has N difficult bid - 3@S, 3!N and 4@C are options|pg||
nt|dkkello: declarer duck?|pg||
nt|dkkello: recert to @H |pg||
nt|tez: diðer masa da sarýgozun 3@h e nasýl battýðýna inanmak zor|pg||
nt|runnerup: a bit lucky once again -normally @c lead beats this -not now|pg||
nt|daman: he has to play it wide open so it will make|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time just  take all from top -basic curs +1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: it looks difficult to set 3N on this board, it will make if west keeps leading spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: another @H works too and back trump later|pg||
nt|kaapo: Especially after this switch|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale widzê, ¿e lêku nie ma te¿ D¯essi jnr|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: might've been a good idea|pg||
nt|key1809: great result in open room, |pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@s dbl is unbelievable|pg||
nt|key1809: defence wd have been more unbelievable, must have been a gross error,3C+1D,goes no where|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  you dont want partner to compete to a higher level if you hold all the kings in the side suits|pg||
nt|dkkello: revert|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not necessary |pg||
nt|friggi: not the best switch|pg||
nt|stevedr: probably still push with h return|pg||
nt|rodal f: Detta gikk illi fort:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: declarer aims for two Hearts tricks to make his 7|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems you can quickly get some refresments during this deal|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense cannot take a ruff and has only 3 aces and @HK|pg||
nt|runnerup: it was too greedy to open here 4. seat|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7 OR ended 1NTS|pg||
nt|jaheim: men 6 hj  med ett "ess",  her hj K, borte,  er beste kontrakt,   som vanlig fra Israel.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|key1809: North wd show his spade 8 to pd, with broad eyes:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I wouldn't go out from the room if my opps do 4@s dbl in this hand :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they did well but the spade situation makes even this contract a bit high|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 or 2 off depends on diamond play|pg||
nt|tez: @s çaktýrmayý düþünüyorsa  büyük @s oynayarak|pg||
nt|veistikke:  would be - 2 yes. a draw :P |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42:  at least will get 50 now|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, or its alikes, is a relatively new trend    consists in rebidding 2@c with good hand and no clear direction, almost any shape|pg||
nt|tez: artýk 3@h tehlikeli|pg||
nt|famus: i think play a small trum and then revert to @C--but have to retain @SA-play a @C and fin a @C shud b a winning line|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lady007: might even always make. if he plays diamonds, declarer has to duck then|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|timve:  yep, but can you bid 3NT with the northhand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|timve:  over 3@H?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Kan vi gjøre annet en å skryte over bridgeferdigheten til Israel de senere år? Nei. De blir sikkert like gode på annet plan over tid.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ntmon: 6@C basically on a finesse, failing|pg||
nt|ritong: something like that, yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vasmar: only way to go 1 off is that defense attacks diamonds first|pg||
nt|bambik: pamietam jak w dawnych czasach jeden z graczy w kolko powiedzial zeby slabo wchodzic trzeba miec gruby portfel ale teraz w rozdaniach komputerowych z reguly jakis fit sie znajdzie|pg||

nt|mamos: i think I would have cashed @cK when I had th chance but all will be well|pg||
nt|ritong: have to admit that a lotsa hands of the " second zone", i.e. strong NT range, offer problems|pg||
nt|cicus: which is why I always wondered why pairs playing  it do not switch system altogether|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like it a lot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|key1809: didnt unblock the dmds, hence 2 down|pg||
nt|eugenio123: :(|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  by the way, this hands perfectly demonstrates why you shouldn't have bid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h9|nt|ntmon: then 3NT is right|pg||

mb|4S!|nt|key1809: South Upgrades his 17, hence will reach .now, East will lead dmds, and West after winning the Ace, will have to shift to spade|pg||
nt|ahri:  overtricks matter only, just like at other table|pg||
nt|cicus: still, defence must be alert to cash their tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: not now|pg||
nt|cicus: on a club switch the hand collapses|pg||
nt|ritong: it is always a good move to cash the side tricks before going for a trump promo|pg||
nt|ritong: more difficult in defense, and the same goes for declarer before cross ruffing|pg||
nt|cicus: no need for promotion here, after removing @CA declare is left with a lot of losers|pg||
nt|cicus: he can take his trumps but nothing else|pg||
nt|cicus: of course, the defence may cash  a couple of @Hs first|pg||
nt|famus: duck|pg||
nt|liujing: a good lead but a bad duck here|pg||
nt|famus: shud b careful not to release @hA|pg||
nt|galois85: yes 3@c asking major. What would you lead in N?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see 6 tricks; AQ of hearts onside does not help; he needs to set up the clubs and prevent EW from cashing 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: still cant make|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  here's a chance for denmark to increase their lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence had to be precise to beat it..|pg||

nt|_fonzie__:  partner cannot have the perfect cards and even if he had them, he still gets a chance to bid|pg||
nt|offthebend: but not easy to handle -- will end up at least -200|pg||
nt|liraren: but when you play 5@h the @cK must bee onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: it allows to stop there when hands do not fit well, it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||

nt|lady007: east might lead a heart indeed|pg||

nt|yusufb: bence|pg||
nt|kaapo: How about 3NT? Denying a decent heart fit, or some kind of serious slam try?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@d is either trf w @h or trf to Nt|pg||
nt|runnerup: south opened ligth again -so ew out of bidding and ns --2@D looked ok -but this --lets see|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like they will stop before here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: *those|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS arrived to proper contract confidently|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  6NT is a lucky contract|pg||

nt|galois85: now 4@d  6@h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Cilla thoughts that she has shown some values here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps via RKC to 6@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42:  6@H is much better|pg||
nt|arigun: secim slogani gibi oldu bu tezcan|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose a spade, a club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the hearts on the @DK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Lorenzini in W in 6NT already|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pinticus: 9 was flat board,4@hX-1here and 3@h-2 OR|pg||
nt|cicus: little by little, Hungary is catching up|pg||
nt|ritong: no need to precise what i think about " garbage" stayman  the name of the convention says it all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Bidding 1NT istead of 2@S looks good, though probably they'd stop at 3 even if he raised|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the open room|pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 6 @s aint. some points for N/s if they get to 6@s|pg||
nt|panosk: this doesnt exist in my opinion 2@D is more than enough with so obvious a misfit|pg||

nt|key1809: west wd have given count as per thier agreements,east shd figure out |pg||
nt|eugenio123: indeed he should easly play @h|pg||
nt|lady007: but i agree, its unlikely that south will make any slam tries|pg||
nt|timve:  If there is no tomorrow I will do something else than playing a serious bridgegame|pg||
nt|timve:  :)|pg||
nt|lady007: what range would north show? is it 24-25? I'm thinking that maybe they play it as unlimited as they dont like the jumps to 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: clear X by W over 4@H and to E over 5@H|pg||
nt|bagman: If N makes a help suit try in hearts, S has a very bad hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|timve:  think the same, so guess south will do a small slemtry with 4@H|pg||
nt|arigun: dikkatli bir oyuna butun 6lar olabilir @c dahil|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu kadar boþa giden @c puanýyla 7 diyemez|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c oynatma bizi cengiz|pg||
nt|tez: yoruldum oluyor mu diye bakmaktan:)|pg||
nt|arigun: @c 8'li olsa garanti idi ama oyle deme :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no idear if it is @sK that is missing and missing 2 aces with 8 cards fit and getting to slam would be very bad bridge:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahri:  same contract as the open room|pg||
nt|offthebend: clubs have to played by east as soon as he gets in with Hearts to avoid some end plays on west |pg||
nt|offthebend: but potential is there for S to make it |pg||
nt|offthebend: West should preserve his Hearts to avoid any end play |pg||
nt|lady007: better to play 4@c as a slamtry here, and 4@h as clubs, so north will still have some kind of last train available|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@S might be kick back|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahri:  and exactly the same bidding|pg||
nt|bmkl: solid @cs make it easy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahri:  with behaving hearts, yes. this lead helps too, claimable after seeing hearts aren't 5-0|pg||
nt|zebutin: or if can show shortness in diamonds and invite that way, not much better then|pg||
pc|hT|nt|key1809: well done, |pg||
nt|timve:  but think 3@S|pg||
nt|timve:  is already fit|pg||
nt|lady007: north might have a minimum if it comes to HCP, but he has a very controlrich hand so i understand 4N|pg||
nt|timve:  so 3NT is serious/non serious (whatever you play)|pg||
nt|lady007: oh yeah sorry, didnt look carefull enough|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s 2@d 3@c 3@d 4@d...|pg||
nt|kaapo: In that case 5@C shows 1 or 4 keys... but maybe they weren't on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|friggi: must be the case|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahri:  same and reasonable lead as open table|pg||
nt|chrisky: now he will go down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@H was Kokish, 2@S relay, 2NT 25-26, 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D no 5M, 3@S 4-card @H|pg||

nt|arigun: perde de hesitasyon 20+ saniye kabul ediliyor bildigim adariyla|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So both player here thinks that they showed sometthing extras but partner didnt understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: Also facing a short suit trial in diamonds, S hand is not good for raise|pg||
nt|panosk: and therfore will go down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|juan lukas: not clear X by N over 4@s ? |pg||

nt|kaapo: Somewhat strange as 4@D really looks like the ace to North|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Gerben42:  4@C cue, 4@H no cue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't really go alonf with all that...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|key1809: but the other way |pg||
nt|mamos: maybe not|pg||
nt|timve:  so seems like north is overdoing it|pg||
nt|lady007: also, slam would be much better if it wasnt for the mirror distribution in clubs|pg||
nt|timve:  true|pg||
nt|lady007: if south had 4 clubs and 2 diamonds, it would be much better|pg||
nt|timve:  lets see the lead|pg||
nt|lady007: i guess it will be a heart|pg||
nt|timve:  think I would lead a heart|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42:  4@S RKC 5@C 1, 5@D Q?|pg||

nt|szalay:  A of @D is better chance than A of @C, I thought|pg||
nt|szalay:  East knows: took 1, will have a trump trick, so he needs 2 tricks yet. I think @D (A) is the best chance, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay:  some kibs asked: easy, why to think? unlucky players are not seeing 52 cards, its the reason:)|pg||
nt|szalay:  this is the most difficult in defence: when u must calculate active (/D) or passive defence is the better likelhood|pg||

nt|offthebend: 4H making for NS  and not in the bidding at all |pg||
nt|liraren: but i am not sure i open with 1@h either in second seat vuln.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3H making 4 or beating 3S by a trick should be normal result |pg||
nt|offthebend: because W is a passed hand , N can put in 2H bid in 2nd round -- bit risky but worth it |pg||
nt|rodal f: Same end as OR|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahri:  i'm surprised west didn't upgrade to 1NT. he almost always does.|pg||

nt|timve:  1@H with north|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3@d makes without @c ruff -but can you bid|pg||
nt|kaapo: Short club and a transfer to spades. The usual style in Sweden is that 1@S shows either minimum and 3-card support or weak NT and 2-3 support|pg||
nt|gio 89: the italians in or, scuse me|pg||

nt|zebutin: it is atleast a good try|pg||
nt|bebechira: now to make it :)|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, wonder what 2@S would show from North|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably passed 2@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: lead was @H Q at other table...so most likely down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|key1809: he might be planning to s/o in 3c|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  or @D|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, KD sets up 7 tricks for the defence it seems|pg||

nt|eugenio123: interesting hand ! finally|pg||
nt|mamos: (through Greek pair in 4@H on 14 !!!!  4-2 |pg||
nt|ritong: meanwhile the hungarians have grinded it up|pg||
nt|famus: @c partial|pg||
nt|kaapo: When the @SA is no longer in the north hand, it's not any better time to lead the singleton...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland will be happy... a very good cricket match|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt|pg||
nt|veistikke:  it would hurt :P@@|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia o 16,30:)|pg||
nt|panosk: the real battle is for places 5-6 where even nineth team currently is with striking distance|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mamos: what a monster for East   - what NT range do we know?|pg||
nt|liraren: i have to go see y around|pg||
nt|yusufb: o yüzden maçlar 16 bordluk 2 devre olarak yapýlýyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu maçýn 2 devresi saat 16:20 de|pg||
nt|yusufb: bbo yayýný var|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes...should have said "don't lead @D, or play it after you have taken trick"|pg||
nt|bagman: true :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|pinticus: dbl shows 4+@h here|pg||
nt|tez: niye pas der eren|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I don't agree to open 1@d|pg||
nt|key1809: 6s/6nt there for the taking|pg||
nt|chrisky: an slam in the minors for ew|pg||
nt|ritong: be careful with 5332!|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  5@d as reached in the other room is the normal contract, and it is normal to go down one by finessing the diamonds|pg||
nt|tez: anlaþýlmaz..bu kadar temel biþey..dbl demedi|pg||
nt|yusufb: eren dikkat ettim elinde 9 puan olmadan konuþmuyor|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In open room did EW plays min nt 9-12HCP and thats why E easily could bid 1@s and not be worry to miss something|pg||
nt|kaapo: Anyhow, here we seem to have a perfectly natural 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H looks like a transfer to spades, maybe invite or better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wrong colours |pg||
nt|bebechira: lol..yea|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s out here is standard.. |pg||
nt|veistikke:  but 4@d is a good contract|pg||
nt|panosk: 5VPs , between 5 places|pg||
nt|runnerup: a good slam -best seems to be 6 @d /east but home also by west like is 6@h -6nt|pg||
nt|panosk: will they find it?|pg||
nt|panosk: .|pg||
nt|runnerup: east worried about many suits like @c -so maybe not|pg||
nt|panosk: pass by west wud be more helpfull but how can he ?|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt -some misfit -some communication problems -something to guess but should make --here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: not sure double was the way to go |pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: i think 15-17|pg||
nt|ritong: the law has its limits|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, never scorig more than 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|cicus: 5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Did North pass in tempo?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here implies that he's made a mistake with the 3@D bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx|pg||
nt|cicus: why was 1@H alerted?|pg||
nt|ritong: mystery|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smell the cards and open 1@S and after pd's 2@c/1nt bid 3nt ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  this is 21:9 for croats now if i am not mistaken, being on the "good" side of the VP scale for croats.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he said can be with 3 cards|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu pasýda kabul edilemez|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here 1D always unbal|pg||
nt|kaapo: With a weak hand 2@S is available|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@H probably in multi-landy context showing a good overcall (my guess)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pinticus: 7@s doesn't make last hand,only 12 tricks|pg||
nt|tez: kontr deyip yaptýrsa mýydý?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He basically removed partner from the decision making with 3@D ... partner's never going to try 5@D after a weak raise like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: oh ,clubs are not breaking|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other boring NT? Can miss it if @S lead from S|pg||
nt|ahri:  a regular 3NT hand here|pg||
nt|pinticus: 10 top tricks here|pg||
nt|yusufb: 29 nolu bordda 6@d dersek baya iyi olur 800 telafi ettigimiz gibi bayada sayý alýrýz ama batan yere gelirsek kotü|pg||
nt|veistikke:  hehe|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ca³e szczêæie, ¿e obroñcy te¿ bêd¹ mieli tu swoje k³opoty|pg||
nt|panosk: dont seem to have any problem this way either, i think they will now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  unless west tries for 6@c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: East is going to have to bid a suit soon|pg||
nt|mamos: I think he should have started with @d   and then bid 6@c the next round|pg||
nt|mamos: poor West   he has no clue what hand his partner has|pg||
nt|famus: looks hopeless|pg||
nt|liujing: but not easy to stop with 25HCP|pg||
nt|famus: but for @s pips|pg||
nt|lechcold: dobra obrona w wykonani Francuzów|pg||
nt|lechcold: wykonaniu|pg||
nt|veistikke:  good pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: it's not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|key1809: north is not going to stop|pg||
nt|eugenio123: never lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but looking for more, 5@S should be still OK |pg||
nt|ritong: according to a very reliable kibitzer, because can have longer @ds and also possibly 7+ hcp|pg||
nt|famus: restricted choices of lead produces the best lead for N-S|pg||
nt|frankbo: seems like he need one D trick to make|pg||
nt|famus: @d10 might produce the setting trick|pg||
nt|famus: from the bidding N wud soon work out Declarer's sing @D|pg||
nt|famus: as the play progresses and has to remain vigilant|pg||
nt|vasmar: stis 20 ta 78 imps einai 25-1|pg||
nt|kaapo: I haven't got or seen EW's notes on agreements so don't know for sure but quite likely|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer can draw trumps, play a heart up and then set the diamonds (or diamonds first and heart then)|pg||
nt|gio 89: once again, same lead as in OR|pg||
nt|runnerup: best lead lets declarer do his guesses -but i think it doent help defence |pg||
nt|rodal f: A normal bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: But..|pg||
nt|jaheim: sparutspill, pls|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yusufb: partskora kolay kolay X demez zeynep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if he had bid 4@D the first time, then partner will move on when that is correct ... and partner can also move on with 4@S on a 4-card suit|pg||
nt|andreasw:  both have showed their hands :) no more to say|pg||
nt|jaheim: nei vel,.......  |pg||
nt|rodal f: Trick 8 on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|key1809: 5nt wd have been a better choice|pg||
nt|ahri:  west admitted fit, showed extras, east was slightly conservative|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: West has 6-6  has had three rounds of bidding and hasnt managed to show one of his six card suits yet|pg||
nt|chrisky: i told ypu we play better they bid better...:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  because @H3-3|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: if this goes wrong it will be entirely East's fault|pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  wow, nice stop|pg||
nt|runnerup: nice @c fit makes 6 @h or @c laydown ,but opponents bid so much that it was not found |pg||
nt|yusufb: derseki bilki en az 2 içeri:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@h e kontr derse @s e ceza pasý geçmiþtim anlamýnda oynuyoruz biz(erenin eli)|pg||
nt|famus: great move--v interesting plan|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so 1 down here i think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on best defence, this is heading down 800, for a deserved Italian swing|pg||
nt|bebechira: -3?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: As weel as @H from same side.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I must say that  I am impressed with the danes in closed room to day |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 7-k¹!!! czemu tak brutalnie?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|chrisky: i think we will pass now|pg||

nt|key1809: yes, how will he figure out the spade K, |pg||
nt|key1809: maybe a 5nt ,now|pg||
nt|eugenio123: he knows nothing about K@H so it is difficult to place all his @h|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d, 2;h,and a @c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|goss: hi all|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi Adrien|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|eugenio123: and now what to lead?|pg||
nt|key1809: Trump?|pg||
nt|key1809: looks safe|pg||
nt|key1809: i presume, he will go for a trump lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it's hard, he would preserve his 10 @s |pg||
nt|yusufb: 6@d demiþiz |pg||
pc|d2|nt|key1809: West is on lead|pg||
nt|eugenio123: ahhhhhhh ok lol|pg||
nt|eugenio123: so trump seemed so normal, @d is another way to lead|pg||
nt|key1809: that was not a good opton, |pg||
nt|rodal f: Karlson by a pzyke?|pg||
nt|timve:  only 7 trikcs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  must be careful playing this|pg||
nt|timve:  would bid 1NT with south his hand|pg||
nt|lady007: so would I|pg||
nt|timve:  2@C on Q10xx |pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: Claim|pg||
nt|lady007: might wrongside NT contracts but you dont even know if you have a club fit|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make if no high ruff comes to his maind|pg||
pc|h4|nt|goss: this one doesn't look good for my friends...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ritong: and i am not talking about BBO star|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|eugenio123: small @C ruff?|pg||

nt|eugenio123: I would like to know what he's thinkig about lol|pg||
nt|famus: Ah i thot @D paly wud've been a great coup|pg||

nt|lady007: i think EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, also from honours so maybe east thought his partner had the queen|pg||
nt|timve:  thats a good explanation|pg||
nt|yusufb: ilkdevrenin son eli|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt oynanýr|pg||
nt|yusufb: aydin iyi atak yaptý ben yapmazdým @c A atagý|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he made it|pg||
nt|friggi: Sweden made some blunders missing the slam though|pg||
nt|kaapo: Oh, better news for Sweden then|pg||
nt|kaapo: Not clear to reach 4@S on that one but if South gets to hear about 3-card support he should give it a try|pg||
nt|bagman: by cashing the @DA, E prevented the nice safetyplay of @DQ (taking care of AT9x on W)|pg||
nt|zebutin: Vallivaara has quite good distribution... 6@D isnt exactly hopeless, just doesn't make|pg||
nt|goss: with a quite hard end (4 top countries to play) France aims at winning its qualification for the world championship|pg||

nt|veistikke:  I must say that N/S Is very unlucky. |pg||

nt|andreasw:  Danish match had a fun board:) who was more lucky? the ones who went 2 down in 6@d wich has 12 tricks and only lost 3 imps? or the ones who bid 7 wich was down 1 while 6 stands and gained 3 imps:)?|pg||

nt|zlatan: not 5 :)|pg||
nt|eleni: right Konstantine|pg||
nt|eleni: 6 maybe due to K@h?|pg||
nt|zlatan: 5nt i think he choose now|pg||

nt|gio 89: EW went a little too far in OR, 4@s -1|pg||
nt|gio 89: same goes for EW here|pg||
nt|runnerup: they all bid 4 @s so no + score here either|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yusufb: 30 imp geriyiz fakat yetiþebiliriz |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  many tricks possible if south plays @h|pg||

nt|bagman: might kill W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: no shortage of hands or bidding in this set :)|pg||
nt|eleni: now Basilis can not fail the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT defeat 10 @S anyway, declarer can duck or win but short by 1|pg||
nt|dkkello: hmm , sorry I was to soon :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3@C from rubino?|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be pass and 3@C from Kytömaa|pg||
nt|kaapo: you think? :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|chrisky: 5@c has some chance|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  another hot result for Sweden - 3NT although there is only a so-so stopper in @S|pg||
nt|galois85: 2@d was made?|pg||
nt|bagman: lead director with Axx|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, i have seen some weird stuff before...this wouldn't be even top 5...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even though 6@D is laydown, I think this was the correct auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Just shows the value of the preempt|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was just typing ..what happened to 6d|pg||
nt|goss: yes 6@d is making but hard to reach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The way to get to 6@D is for South to re-open with 5@D, and North to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|lechcold: problem w tym, ¿e WJ nie przewiduje ¿adnego rebidu z t¹ kart¹:)|pg||
nt|panosk: small spade beter here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  which is out of the question now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South troubled now because he has a six card suit as yet unshown|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he likes the scoresheet til now|pg||
nt|cicus: you could say it was the vulnerability, but nonvul it would have been 3@S for me |pg||
nt|_fonzie__:  interesting rebid with an average 5card suit|pg||
nt|lady007: yes and low from a doubleton might be bad in more situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I honestly think that 3NT was the better percentage choice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: I agree 1@c, most players prefer to open 1nt but he has a strong bidable hand |pg||
nt|key1809: 1c, followed by 2d, is good option|pg||
nt|pinticus: last time I play against EW,they play all transfers,even after X,maybe they've modified something|pg||
nt|ntmon: i share N unwillingness to bid 1NT with both majors, even having proper PC range|pg||
nt|lady007: you usually want to lead high from a doubleton to force declarer to play an honour. if you return a small one, he can easily duck it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: however, this is not a KO match  every board counts at the end of the round robin|pg||
nt|timve:  I agree|pg||
nt|dkkello: yes only 8 ? |pg||
nt|eleni: a nice multi opening:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But this is what we need :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Double would be nice though ;)|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart lead and ducked|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba wola³bym 2@C, wskazuj¹c 5+trefli i 15+PC|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: 1@H seems to be 4@S and one rond force.|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  must try 5@C now|pg||
nt|zlatan: 6@d bi=7@d|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I guess some of them wont sleep that good tonight :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: the only one in my opinion|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  ruff two @S |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and rely on @D finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: but it is human to stay quiet after two apparently good boards|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I don't think so really EW have played well..|pg||
nt|famus: if they land in 4@Hs--might get it o make it too--wud b a great board|pg||
nt|famus: *to|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: do we know what 3@d is? it was alerted and maybe 2N would just show diamonds. in that case this might have promised 3crd heart support|pg||
nt|lady007: this contract wont cause much problems for declarer|pg||
nt|timve:  although he doesnt know yet the diamonds breek, but he will test them eventually and make his contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: yes|pg||
nt|runnerup: except that this makes now -lead was enougt  |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, I agree, I only wanted to demonstrate how I set about losing matches|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|timve:  3@C with south or pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chrisky: 1 nt for ns|pg||
nt|ntmon: or 6@D for that matter|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how they super raise with balanced hands|pg||
nt|lady007: 3@c is pass/correct|pg||
nt|runnerup: in other table east just played it out after @h j -and @h ---two way to make -with @s finess -or @d to ace -no he played small -when north switched a @d |pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: i hope it s not 2NT " almost forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: in the same time Italy, my team, is winning 42/18  |pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|tejjyid: What's your preference? 2NT unconditional force?|pg||
nt|ritong: nope.|pg||
nt|ritong: too acid for my stomach|pg||
nt|lady007: its a nice contract but both club honours offside, as well as the queen of spades, might creat some difficulties|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards seems to be nicely for 3nt|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@c is min|pg||
nt|goss: but then you need to have discussed the auction with pd : 3S p p X p 5C p 5D|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew --some 9-10 in @d but i bet they dont play there -or-lets see|pg||
mb|4H|nt|key1809: in the open room, they bid 7s, and declarer finessed the 10!!!|pg||
nt|eugenio123: nooooooooo|pg||
nt|ahri:  operator: did north upgrade or is it 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: i like 3 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: though|pg||
nt|famus: 4-1 trump break again we see|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Specs. S can not bid 3@H now. Game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: he upgrated to 15|pg||
nt|chrisky: or 2@D|pg||
nt|ntmon: but agree, @S fit is at hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I must say I like to play 2NT NF|pg||
nt|zlatan: typical 1nt opening after a bad board :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: they managed to bid 4@S at other table too on 15, so most likely same score|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H to prawdopodobnie dwukolorówka:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|goss: here Robert is showing 5-5 with little hope for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pinticus: Italy gains 3MPs,Madala plays 6@s+1 on 14(@d lead)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: he mithg 've playd J at least...|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@S if forcing is unusual treatment|pg||
nt|pinticus: some misunderstanding here,3@s is looking for slam|pg||
nt|ntmon: if 3@S forcing, how they invite?|pg||
nt|pinticus: on 15,Turkey in 3@c|pg||
nt|pinticus: they bid 4@s to invite :)|pg||
nt|ritong: because it s so funny when pard leaves it in, opponents think " these suckers forgot" and it is the only making spot|pg||
nt|timve:  more then some problems|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chrisky: good pass for s|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C for a balanced raise is a good choice, the bid is idle anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like 3NT for the "Acol 2" type rebid; but I admit it's rare|pg||
nt|ritong: philo issue|pg||
nt|dkkello: No @H lead now , France closing in |pg||
nt|goss: otherwise, he wd bid 4@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: 4@D directly over 1NT?|pg||
nt|goss: yes french standard|pg||
nt|goss: showing 5-5 majors, game level|pg||
nt|8252: non parla l'italiano qui ? |pg||
nt|goss: si si :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|timve:  maybe south can read the points|pg||
nt|timve:  KQ of hearts, KQ of clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, heart ruff is a chance|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think this convention is the most common in sweden after 4 NT blackwood|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahri:  playing heart and another can sound good but it will help declarer with drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ntmon: whatever their methods are, they did not prove efficient|pg||
nt|dkkello: no way to lead @H K now|pg||
nt|ybob: if S play @C at trick 2  its easy to W ( after @D lead) A @C and K@H ...|pg||
nt|bagman: if 2@S was FG, S had time to listen to a reaction from N with 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: cards lie badly for NS|pg||
nt|eleni: As announced: Israel and Poland are now tied in 1st place with 101 VP, 2 ahead of Italy and 9 ahead of France|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think the only contract that makes|pg||
nt|chrisky: only j@H beat -1|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@C used to be good 6-4 but those types can be handled other in ways|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The youngsters are required to play French Standard, are they?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tejjyid: I've also seen 3 OM, but that's giving up another useful bid|pg||
nt|timve:  with @SA he would have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|famus: wud go down in 5@s ass well|pg||

nt|ahri:  good switch|pg||

nt|lady007: yes but can he set up the spades then?|pg||
nt|juan lukas: on a @d lead, declarer has to pick up the Q@s |pg||

nt|timve:  if he went for it yes|pg||
nt|lady007: maybe it would have worked better for east to return a low heart, so west can play another round of trumps|pg||
nt|timve:  yep|pg||
nt|ybob: S showed AQ @D now|pg||
nt|famus: i think instead of 4nt e wud've done well had he cue bid in @Cs|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4@H probably shows some extras as with a weaker hand South might jump to 4@H over 2@C|pg||
nt|loe48: ja slaget maa vel kunne sies tapt..og gratulere til Israel, takk for meg ogsaa|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: I don;t like 4@C becasue it's hard to get back to 3NT|pg||

pc|h8|nt|eleni: Just look at the site, after the end of each round |pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think that West's duck of @DA was all that wise|pg||

nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like a board that should not affect any matches|pg||
nt|goss: @s|pg||
nt|8252: surprising french standard commands a 1@s|pg||
nt|goss: I don't understand here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|goss: maybe it's transfer|pg||
nt|rado: myabe 1@H is TRF:)|pg||
nt|bebechira: ahhh|pg||
nt|goss: yes i think so|pg||
nt|8252: unlees they play "cachalot" |pg||
nt|8252: which is to say transfer|pg||
nt|goss: thk they do|pg||
nt|bebechira: not alerted...|pg||
nt|goss: then dangerous|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: alert was very late|pg||
nt|rado: 4NT explains the things 1@H i s @s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@s-2@h-2@d-1@c so 7?:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eugenio123: bad now :)|pg||
nt|goss: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Que with @H normaly|pg||
nt|ahri:  2@d is "weak weak two in major"|pg||
nt|kaapo: But at least bidding slams is nice. Keeps the players fresh :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: thx Todor|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes or 6 :P depens how they lead|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @d everytime they get inn|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  2@h and 2@s are constructive ones, so west knows how to compite (and not to lead heart :D)|pg||
nt|ahri:  *compete|pg||
nt|lady007: I think 2@d is alerted because it shows less than 16|pg||
nt|lady007: but thats just a guess|pg||
nt|bagman: N needs to push the @SQ thru|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt /4 @h -those will do -but 800 you cant get so 9 lost here ..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do that alert mean 3@H vug opp?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|key1809: East shd jump to 3nt , showing  a max, 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|ntmon: this will end up with @H game, although NS have 4@S sacrifice available |pg||
nt|eleni: a safe contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the margin will be around 20 IMPs for Denmark when the smoke has cleared|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: but was right|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS in trouble in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: why?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E opens 2@d multi|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah right, some East's might venture an opening|pg||
nt|goss: 5@c showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Asks for trump queen|pg||
nt|goss: should bid 6@d now|pg||
nt|goss: to show Q of trumps and K@d|pg||
nt|rado: and 6@S easy ruffing 3@C ( precious 8@s)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Agustin in 6d in brd 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: should be 15 16 points |pg||
nt|rodal f: E is finned|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Win 10, flat, lose 10 most likely|pg||
nt|famus: that wud set it|pg||
nt|bebechira: after Agustin dbled the 3s preemt|pg||
nt|goss: on which auction ?|pg||
nt|goss: ok|pg||
nt|bambik: ciekawe jak sobie poradzi z rozgrywka|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: there was a french "scientist" named gesthem who advocated this long ago  only got sneering in his own time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  6 @d bye |pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@D there so really a trouble|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Jessi jednak ma en eggs:0|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like coffee 3nt this time|pg||
nt|panosk: ok thx Todor|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007: IF a 2@s response to 1@h was weak, and IF 2@h showed less than 16, east might have tried 3@c here as west should either have a stronger hand than a weak 2@s jump, or only a 5crd ...|pg||
nt|lady007: suit and maybe a club fit|pg||
nt|lady007: but now lets see what happens to 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007: it looks like declarer will lose 2 clubs and 3 spades|pg||
nt|lady007: so probably just made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will play @D AK and @D and play for a @S houner in place|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Wasn't W free to bid 4@D at the road?. My way always.|pg||
nt|baardolav: hehe|pg||
nt|famus: -2 even if madala tries to make|pg||
nt|famus: a duck here wud have been a double dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 6NT is the slam to be in|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3s p pd-4nt-6d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eleni: depemds on the guess of Mike Sofios|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Bidding visionaries often aren;t appreciated|pg||
nt|goss: I agree with X|pg||
nt|panosk: last match tommorow at 10.00 local , 9.00 CET, will be Israel vs Norway and Italy vs Belgium|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eleni: S has to give up his losers early enough and guess correctly the @H|pg||
nt|baardolav: we see the transfer in action here|pg||
nt|bebechira: Bill recommended 3nt|pg||
nt|goss: I know :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still do ... but I certainly accept the double|pg||
nt|goss: thanks !|pg||
nt|veistikke:  or @c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: ghestem sorry|pg||
nt|dkkello: I am told to moderate my nice words from before , I hereby do so by 25 %|pg||
nt|dkkello: make it 40|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks, vugraph|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: bridge is for fun, kjeld|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is hard ...and Delle Cave 4nt made things easy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: transfer? 1@C-1@H was natural a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|ritong: a real visionary  created a system called " monaco" who still looks supermodern 40 years later|pg||
nt|baardolav: Ahh... sorry some kind of 4-6 hands, bidding @d first|pg||
nt|cicus: 1 diamonds is 0-7 points, natural or relay - is what I am told|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  i dont belive on that result after a splead in open room|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@D is down on a @S lead????|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently Fryklund didn't believe his partner has any trumps, but he had a trump trick himself|pg||
nt|bagman: now the @HQ scores and NS can take the club ruff, too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem with the double ... partner bids 4@C, and there goes 3NT which could easily be your only making game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|runnerup: this maybe expensive -they should have run to 2 @c -but perhaps no sats convension|pg||
nt|goss: then hope to also make 5@d...|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
nt|8252: double ruff brings 12 easy tricks, if W doesn't switch @s : 9 @s K @d and the 2 aces|pg||
nt|rado: that's the reason people open 3@S sometimes:)|pg||
nt|veistikke:  @s now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chrisky: no quess is neded|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cicus: 1ha shows nt hand or hearts and clubs, 1sp asks, 1 nt shows balanced hand - same spec|pg||
nt|baardolav: a good game 5@d, a little bit unlucky|pg||
nt|cicus: thanks for your kind help, all pectators|pg||
nt|cicus: good contract reached|pg||
nt|dkkello: I know!   read my E-mail adress!|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding here|pg||
nt|galois85: so let's get back to 15-15? |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So they one good slambidding and one bad  |pg||
nt|friggi: this will bring some IMP's to Sweden:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here the bidding was natural |pg||
pc|d7|nt|eleni: and that was not the card it should have feen plaued:)|pg||
nt|timve:  south tries to find an 6 sixth trick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|key1809: wouldnt he open 1nt with 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|eleni: now things look a lot brighter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19-11 VPs is my guess|pg||
nt|goss: here once you have made the 3 and 4 of spade, you're home|pg||
nt|bebechira: Italy is extending the lead , but unfortunately for them..Israel is only 11 imps down to Netherlands at the moment|pg||
nt|8252: correct, but on @s switch, Robert must play on his @c, with precise timing|pg||
nt|goss: all that results are not helping my country !|pg||
nt|goss: yes, @s switch would have jeopardize the contrat|pg||
nt|lechcold: teraz bêdzie -2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new @H are normaly the best def. Don't matter here.|pg||
nt|eleni: now it's imperative the 9|pg||
nt|eleni: well even that:)|pg||
nt|chrisky: A@s @s AND A @c return -1 |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: powinien sobie poradziæ|pg||
nt|bambik: musi cos trafic|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: to nie jest stolik Blata:) bezcenne @SK i @CJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|liujing: is that necessary to cover Q?|pg||
nt|famus: last chance|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: Nice def|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lady007: he'd better give his partner a club ruff or there wont even be a 5th trick|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark now a firm 3rd 17 vps ahead of France|pg||
nt|veistikke:  avoid would be nice :P. |pg||
nt|bambik: masz racje Lechu|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eugenio123: with 5 cardss majors?|pg||
nt|8252: forced to play well now, like we say in the Lions Club of Derbyshire|pg||
nt|8252: it's funny to see how double ruff play is not natural : this board should take 30 seconds |pg||
nt|goss: he might be tired...|pg||
nt|bebechira: long event|pg||
nt|lechcold: odwrót kierowy i roz³¹czenie atutów |pg||

nt|chrisky: he has to qess the @D|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some choices how to bid after the reverse|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3 szóstki?|pg||
nt|bambik: za chwile okaze sie czy ma 00|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andreasw:  @S 10 would be wrong.. i highly doubt W would play a @S back if he had an honour if he had and felt endplayed it would 100% be the K;)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chrisky: quess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: for those more interested in the meaning of bids: 2@C Stayman, 2@S 4@S, 3@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|cicus: but S did not obey|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: I can't tell how N knew S had not much wasted value inclubs|pg||

nt|bambik: szczesliwie nie musi|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: for me the concept of inquiring the balanced hand is hard to grasp|pg||
nt|panosk: my personal opinion and with no disrespect for the rest of the teams here , Israel was the favourite from the start|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|eugenio123: I don't like opening with 5 cards majors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andreasw:  8tricks! Wd|pg||

nt|Walddk4: For obvious reasons West can only get one ruff against 4@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the decider, thanks all in Bulgaria...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: all specs, and co-commentators|pg||
nt|ybob: can E read the @C suit to win 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe if S open weak @D ...|pg||
nt|ybob: but juniors open 1@D|pg||
nt|juan lukas: but if S open weak @d , they will play 5@d i think |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north may bid spades first|pg||
nt|ybob: but lost 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: they take a break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lose 4 trump tricks in 5 diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose many would bid 2@S as north: 5+@S and forcing|pg||
nt|bebechira: Israel-Netherlands 35-36 so 15-15|pg||
nt|goss: should reach 4@h here|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie ma emotek :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: not very many would have put money against that |pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: another monster hand|pg||
nt|dkkello: Did W pass that @H hand in open room ?! |pg||
nt|goss: which is touchy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: NS shall cope with this preemt|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult hand|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@d multi|pg||
nt|lady007: NS can make 4@s here, and EW maybe 4@h but N wont let them play there|pg||
nt|lady007: lets see if they will compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 3NT by N ? |pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|goss: but could make on @s good guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i was at danish festival ... was playing a tourney .. i was in 2nt where all just sat bad and i was glad i was in 2nt! i somehow got 8 tricks and i had like 5:D no one else took 8! except my pd who was playing with someone else who where in 3nt |pg||
nt|panosk: that was the general feel indeed |pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d here is well done -i wander if it is bid without ns ,s help -needs @h 3-3-so |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahri:  most probably 3NT hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and took 9 lol:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: they must steer away from the rather poor slam|pg||
nt|ritong: just needs a @d jack to produce a cold slam|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|cicus: if the bid slam with @DJ and stay in 5@D without it we say well done|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if 2@s describes this handtype, the @s K is not wasted|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal 4 @s but bad sits -down 1 is the destany|pg||
nt|kaapo: Though a kib would have played small diamond, hoping for a misguess by the chocked declarer :)|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahri:  french kib (thanks) claims it's 4+@h 4+@s|pg||

nt|ntmon: this is really strange development|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least on the diamond lead|pg||
nt|goss: only @c really beats it|pg||
nt|veistikke:  yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|zlatan: if he didnt have the lead dbl would be nice|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D looks @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but surely NS have underbid, after all 5 diamonds a good contract|pg||
nt|juan lukas: if S has a @h honnor, then he can hardly have a @c honnor  for his bid |pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: and declarer may take the @c correctly |pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|rodal f: b|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: what was 3@c some gadget shame if you cant bid suit like AKQJx|pg||
nt|eleni: and how can they find those Cris, as none bid them?|pg||
nt|bagman: and ducks twice to set up a spade for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|veistikke:  dbl from west shows 15+|pg||
pc|c6|nt|goss: few mistakes by Italians since I arrived|pg||

pc|s7|nt|key1809: not a bad idea to go for overtricks, but ur contract shd never b in danger all the way|pg||

nt|ritong: last bullet now|pg||
nt|zlatan: anyway dbl is no almost no cost if in in other room partners dont bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And now the good board for Sweden. Rimstedt did well when she passed 1@H. It propelled N-S to 4@S, and 5@D can't quite make. And even better, the Swedes collected 500 when declarer ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of an exciting match|pg||
nt|lady007: south might double, but north wont and might even bid 5@s|pg||
nt|timve:  yep on this board its very good to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|lady007: even if its a wrong bid in theory, it might work out very well|pg||
nt|dkkello: well done |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: welldone|pg||

nt|andreasw:  really care what systm they play.. i cant sell out to 2@h|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough 4@H - I think going downona @S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: this rather offtrack opening might get them out of game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many thanks to Todor, our excellent operator in Albena. Good job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: thx|pg||
nt|timve:  and preferably fast and convincing|pg||

nt|panosk: and gd defence |pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 in either major if you dont loose 2 @h -|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor, our great operator!|pg||
mb|1D|an|!H|mb|d|nt|eleni: Last board for this round:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we are back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden may even gain 12 IMPs here, but it won't change the result, 19-11|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d bye N|pg||
nt|lechcold: juniorom licytacja nie powinna sprawi trudnoci:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: sprawiæ|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@H to piki|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if dbl would be penalty i would either dbl or bid 2@S on N hand:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eugenio123: I'll be back at 16:20 cet to comment italian girl... who knows what my eyes will see lol|pg||
nt|key1809: :)|pg||
nt|chrisky: the lower you stop in @S the better|pg||
nt|lady007: 3N for east here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Earlier I remarked that it has been a tough day for Finland - but tougher still it is for the operators, who may have to keep focused through all 60 boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: this is the last board... we have to thank to Todor our vg operator...a wonderful job|pg||
nt|veistikke:  i still wonder how they got 7 tricks inn 1@h|pg||
nt|runnerup: and again Italy cant loose in this -slam bid and made |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ritong: next room could not avoid the 6@d snag|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate that 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Häxan in effect here?|pg||
nt|bagman: interesting 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so well done|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot Todor for the fine work|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eugenio123: it seems they play forcing nt, another terrible convention I would never play|pg||
nt|ahri:  would be fun to see club lead with diamond underlead on 4@s. just for sake of entering bulletin.|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: :) ty|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D shuld been alerted. Tr for @H 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri:  sweating time for east|pg||
nt|ahri:  and a great lead for south|pg||
nt|chrisky: i think he is in control|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@c showing any 16+ or 14-16 with 6@s|pg||
nt|lady007: 2@D showing 8+ and GF opposite 16+|pg||
nt|dkkello: 3 NT ?|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is good|pg||
nt|ybob: hard now  3nt :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 3@S is a overbid|pg||
nt|goss: thanks Todor|pg||
nt|rado: down 2 probably now but hard to dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjn: :)u wlc|pg||
mb|5D|nt|runnerup: this looks like 4 @s but can you make it -you have to be careful -@d ruff beats|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He showed a cl suit here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@C would be strong or long @Hs - so with clubs Mikael has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bagman: In NT the defense can grab 7 first tricks (and declarer has only 6 quick)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1BA wzmocnione systemowo chyba - st¹d inwit Jassema|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Back in 1½ hours with 4 more matches|pg||
nt|kaapo: Though maybe 1NT would be an option also|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Madala shows only @d in other room |pg||
nt|zebutin: seems finns are pushing for slam on 17...so might be again chunk of imps coming to Finlands bag|pg||
nt|lechcold: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how they "only" got or how they GOT 7:)?|pg||

nt|panosk: diamond lead tricky though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: Q@c?|pg||
nt|pinticus: so,last board of this set|pg||
nt|ybob: as 2@H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think west should have bid 4 spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: and of course many thanks to Bill, Adrien and Rado..excellent job as well|pg||
nt|lechcold: wyniki live|pg||
nt|lechcold: no niestety...|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie nasza para otwiera bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|veistikke:  how they only got :P|pg||
mb|p|nt|eugenio123: I prefer Gazzilli...|pg||
nt|key1809: thats the best|pg||
nt|pinticus: maybe it's a fortunately coincidence they play only this set today,lot of time to rest,recover and talk about misunderstandings|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, 15 with both majors and a singleton, this is really looking for trouble|pg||
nt|dkkello: I think 2 @H is more an overbid than 3 @S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, looks like this may turn out for a decent match for our team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not sure I care for that 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: ka¿de 11, itp|pg||
nt|rodal f: From there the 3@D minisplinter came|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eugenio123: gazzilli is one of the most important convention|pg||
nt|key1809: yes, if ur playing standard, then gazzilli is a must|pg||
nt|eugenio123: bye the way 2nt is not the best they could play|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks all for a nice segment. TKs specialy to the exelent vug. opperator. Tks aso to the specs for there nice input's. See u later.|pg||
nt|lady007: east not bothering to show his minor|pg||
nt|timve:  seems like an easy contract with both red kings onside|pg||
nt|runnerup: the other table made it i am told|pg||
nt|famus: this has been an eventful contest--both teams played well--But i give my vote to the Danes as winner in todays contest--they displayed great resilience--well done--Thanks alll|pg||
nt|liujing: last board|pg||
nt|liujing: a lot of swings in this segment|pg||
nt|spenny80: buffon|pg||
nt|spenny80: sorry it was my pw|pg||
nt|garden2005: na pochy³e drzewo ka¿da koza skacze :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lady007: vd Bos might lead a club, which wont exactly be the killing lead, setting up 2 clubs for declarer|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 4@s is a good contract : 1 down because of the @h stiff |pg||
nt|ybob: maybe win 4@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it seems declarer can be kept out of dummy|pg||
nt|ybob: because S has to play both red suits|pg||
nt|bagman: this might make for a small gain compared to 1NT down one|pg||
nt|veistikke:  I see now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rado: tx all operator kibs and commentators:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|timve:  the 6 and 7 of clubs should be reversed|pg||
nt|lechcold: st¹d brak inwitu 2BA od Tuczyñskiego|pg||
pc|c2|nt|key1809: if north wins, e-w can make 3nt|pg||
nt|timve:  would make the lead a lot better|pg||
nt|lady007: true. nice try by van Lankveld to play the 9|pg||
nt|timve:  the second round south can take the king|pg||
nt|runnerup: guessing now to all -2@c -good hand --2@d=8+ --3@d= gf with @h and @d and so on|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahri:  just a moment before north played queen, mr. goren messaged me with "will north unblock @c"|pg||
nt|lady007: then they can set up the suit next if partner would have A7x left|pg||
nt|kaapo: France up against Israel, so with a great result, Italy would've been much closer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Grzesiu pamiêtasz mo¿e detektywa Banaczka?|pg||
nt|garden2005: nie :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: by³ taki serial i tam wystêpowa³ Banaczek - Polak z pochodzenia choæ Amerykanin|pg||
nt|bambik: nie rozumiem dlaczego pierwszego trefla zabil krolem przeciez potrzebuje dojsc do reki|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i on cytowa³ polskie przys³owia w swoisty sposób je krzy¿uj¹c np. kto rano wstaje to ka¿da kmoza skacze|pg||
nt|lechcold: w tej chwili 6 miejsce od 10 dzieli tylko 7VP...5 kandatów na jedno premiowane miejsce|pg||
nt|lechcold: nasi maj¹ 2VP do 6-go|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i tak cz³owiek skazany na ogl¹danie gromadzi te niedok³adnoci a potem mówi¹, ¿e zmierz³y i czepia siê do byle czego|pg||
pc|c5|nt|key1809: west has to cash dmds, and play clubs for mini-tel no|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|key1809: north knows, he's is sunk, as both suits are open, does he sttle for 6 tricks by finessing hearts, and cashing SA|pg||
nt|timve:  and finesse Q6 in west with A7 in north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cicus: and no rebid problem either|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na szczêcie kontrakt jest dalej chodliwy na podziale pików|pg||
nt|panosk: then he shud jus bang the Ace@H and pray|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 2 @c like gazilli -can be normal hand also with @h and @c -but then he would bid 2 @H to 2 @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ybob: and declarer can ruff the third @H trick to push trumps ( not play A@H ) later discard on A the @D looser|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzjn: bye|pg||
nt|goss: 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|liujing: thx all|pg||
nt|famus: I was going to respond--since I praised the Danish boys more--maybe the Italian in you got aroused and called me a buffoon--haha:))))np Fabio|pg||
nt|liujing: 4@S is played in open room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahri:  a prophet, i say.|pg||
nt|baardolav: I do not agree with that:) 1@d 1nt... is a problem... you need to pass, there is no rebid problems in nt either|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ritong: merci a tous, was great fun for this sunday morning|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ntmon: 3NT is normal but destined to fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: next match of Italy is the decisive one...they face Israel and ONLY a big win will give them any chances to the title|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ussaly when you dont get many tricks in a contract there is can be 2 reasons  1. Bad declaring 2. good defence;)|pg||
