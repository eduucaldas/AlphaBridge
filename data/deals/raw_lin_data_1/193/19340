nt|cumino: 4@D is down with the best defence|pg||
nt|tomi2: norths hand has not really becom soo much better after the non forcin 2@D call. qx and kjt are not the best holing for 5@D|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|tomi2: just discussing with a kib if 4@C is just a raise to 4@D and indicates a @C lead vs 4@S or if it is some invit to 5@D|pg||

nt|uttam: good aft from India|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Netherlands are 7th currently, which means they have plenty of motivation (6th place goes to the world championship)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|oosb: Straight forward 3NT to start with|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Uttam|pg||
nt|kemperg: so an important match|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like this can make, losing a @C, 2@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CK and @DK weel placed, no problems |pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankbo: ok han er ikke her|pg||

nt|spenny80: Italy 3rd vs Poland 2nd...|pg||
nt|rodal f: *specs|pg||
nt|iceblue: Hi,|pg||
nt|zebutin: Di Franco bid quite little with minor monster, but partner doesn't have @C J so 5@D seems most likely to go down, would need 2 entries in Rubinos hand + ruff to raise diamond suit|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi Johan|pg||
pc|dT|nt|asig: 2@h should make in comfort, so an easy start to the championships|pg||
nt|rodal f: A invitation? Positive or negative trail? Nope.|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably ew will play in diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi|pg||
nt|bebechira: last match for the girls|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Trianin|pg||
nt|iceblue: Do they play Netherlands club?|pg||

nt|dagold: so going down|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Vladimir, welcome|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  E/W|pg||
nt|dagold: In the other room north didn't sell out to 2@h|pg||
nt|richie: two strong pairs facing each other in this match, it will be interesting to watch I expect|pg||
nt|richie: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|raghavan: What  has happened?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|asig: I would have reopened, too|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level.... probably Ticha expected more from such a hand :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4s in the open room as well...so quiet start to a decisive match :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  hi all|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: this is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've see Birman lead 4th instead of 3rd, starting to wonder about that|pg||
nt|kemperg: In OR W in 3@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: very simple equation for Agustin and co... they must win.. and win big|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eliran_a: hi all and welcome going to be a great match ! 1st against the 2nd !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: double or 2@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wont challenge declarer too much with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|spenny80: a normal 3NT on 1st board |pg||
nt|richie: 3NT is the only game which may have a chance with these wild distriutions, Magdalena Ticha will probably bid it |pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  8 ver - nine...?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ever|pg||
nt|asig: 2@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re Frank:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Our teams this morning: The Netherlands are 1st and Italy 3rd, so it will be a thrilling match|pg||
nt|mrdct: can make 12 now with @h 3-3|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: 1@sX in the other room, it needs courage to pass 1@sX with 7 diamonds though!|pg||
nt|rodal f: As we saw, NL use invitation jacoby.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Here we see EW plays the new swedish club|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc would never missed that in my own hometown|pg||
nt|zebutin: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ntmon: EW showed semi-forcing-to-game, NT range, E transferred to @H, W accepted|pg||
nt|josj: good morning eleni|pg||
nt|josj: and gm Vladimir|pg||
nt|ntmon: gm Eleni and Jos|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h good morning Jos:) welcome|pg||
nt|richie: extremely complex board, there is no communication between the hands |pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing in 2d :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: but Israel will probably have to say something about this ....|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we must say that they had a great tournament.. fantastic players|pg||
nt|richie: probably, let's see, it has already been proven they are excellent players but  not infallable|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol... |pg||
nt|bebechira: Eliran will say something about this for sure....|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Markku|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: maybe there is an interesting defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankbo: :)|pg||
nt|richie: probably @s7, @sK and @dQ will be the best you can do as declarer and hope for something good|pg||

nt|bcmandal: 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: will go down 3 against a partscore at best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oosb: Since AK@S are both with @S|pg||
nt|oosb: even @C are blocked for defence|pg||
nt|uttam: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|oosb: 11?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|uttam: y 11 becos of @c lay out|pg||
nt|josj: 3 rounds of spades|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: jest to przedostania runda, druga po³owa meczy pomiêdzy dwiema pierwszymi dru¿ynami w tabeli|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't mind the 4S but it should have cost|pg||
pc|s8|nt|richie: great result for the french in the open room, +500|pg||

pc|sT|nt|gronkvist:  1@c is 12-14 ntor 18-19 Nt or Natural with transfer respones|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like easy 10 tricks, losing 1 in both majors and diamond, so still little time to get coffee|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dan_ehh: possibly going down now, as Padon has discarded his low @H and might get to ruff declarer's king|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eliran_a: both players of italy and israel are players from the highest level in the juniors playing over 8 or 9 years of massive bridge |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bebechira: west in 2s dbled in the open room...fireworks starting... very good|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|bebechira: may be special sequence|pg||
nt|raghavan: PARTNER OPENS BEUGER HAS good hand why stop in 2D|pg||
nt|iceblue: S must play this 2@D as XYZ, game forcing.|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: must be|pg||
nt|chick: doubled would have cost enough to make my point :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bebechira: in the closed W in 2nt|pg||
nt|bebechira: easier for our West in Diamonds..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Marion:)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Top on its ways to France (N/S)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: i am expecting a high level match with some creative stuff ! the players are really talented|pg||
mc|7|nt|gronkvist:  And now is the point of this deal made or not made|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps in 2nd seat 3S is enough|pg||

nt|doks: 15 round of Juniors Championship 3rd and 7th place match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 5d in the open room so flat brd to start with|pg||
mb|3C|nt|oosb: Possibly some sort of bergen?|pg||
nt|oosb: or 2NT limit + type|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h for NS...and 5d save for 3 imps for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: only 5 tricks in the closed it seems.... so what is 2 imps between friends|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oosb: I'll try to get their system notes|pg||
nt|josj: better to duck the @D lead, I think, increases the chances|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have the values for game here - but none seem to be making|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a flat board of 10 tricks in hearts contract|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hawe45:  6 @D is making much more pressure - West must know, that N/S have 1430 easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South know, that North has no @D-kontrol?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norge på kroken virke det som.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B1 Netherland at 4@S|pg||
nt|uttam: south cant accpt the game|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@C should be 9-11 with 4+@S|pg||
nt|spenny80: only if south bid @h|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards sitting well enough to make 4@h|pg||
nt|richie: many people will bid 1NT in north, but I like dbl more when you hold only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bebechira: England had a steady start in the test vs India... cricket of course|pg||
nt|szalay:  hi all!|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rodal f: Har d for S to find the @H lead?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: byæ mo¿e nie wszyscy wiedz¹, ¿e Joanna Taczewska to Joanna Krawczyk - chyba najbardziejutytulowana juniorka na wiecie, która z³ote medale zdeobywa³a tak¿e w reprezentacji open ...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: juniorskiej |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but N would not have been doubling for penalties|pg||
nt|chick: not only is it a level lower, but it would double to game, whereas NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and NS had no game|pg||
nt|chick: so it's safer, and might push the opps too high, whereas 4@S has all the downsides|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1nt overcall maybe not to everyones taste, in zone, with 14hcp and 5card major...|pg||
nt|szalay:  I'm GyÃ¶rgy Szalay from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|zebutin: hi György|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a really funny 1N call|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like 4 @C tricks, 2 @H tricks, but 7th might be a problem|pg||
nt|szalay:  u know crazy man or genious: depends on outcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: teams profiles|pg||
nt|bebechira: for Netherlands|pg||
nt|richie: 2@h or 3@H is the normal result, only when the dutch girls here bid 3NT they may win some imps|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT is a normal invite - pass is modest by Sigrid (east)|pg||
nt|bebechira: Poland http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=POLAND@@892|pg||
nt|richie: well... not difficult for Joanna :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: WD and domed the contract is.|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead. not sure i would have led the same but Axxx usually isnt so attractive to lead from either|pg||
nt|zebutin: in club suit defender could try to toss 10 or J under A, to give declarer option of finese for 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=NETHERLANDS@@892|pg||

nt|bebechira: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/asp/participantsDetailBeforeSchedule.asp?qteamid=FRANCE@@892|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT looks like being beaten by a S lead from either side|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 6@C is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I wonder if they can find it after west showing both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|uttam: v nice stop|pg||
nt|oosb: Good discipline. |pg||
nt|oosb: They didnt get tempted by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ntmon: she choose reasonable way, at least|pg||
nt|spenny80: or played by E|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 2d=good raise|pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood to Israel|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s went 3 down, first imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay:  do u mean stiff J/T?|pg||
nt|szalay:  in that case West could lead that (6card)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  7 @D X = 500 normally|pg||
nt|rodal f: Var litt tidlig ute der. Sr, sidejobbing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: +2. Next|pg||
nt|mrdct: if east declares might dodge the @d lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@d is a sort of minimum hand without unbalanced 4M|pg||
nt|raghavan: yES OTHER ROOM MADE ot TOO|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sweden need a 21-9 to capture the silver|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@C? strong2? seems unlikely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|uttam: 2nd deal, n we see underlead of an ace|pg||
nt|oosb: Being a junior myself I have to admit, part of these game decisions is also thinking, "ok so on my seat in the other room, is another junior, and he's thinking the same thing about ...|pg||
nt|oosb: me, so I might as well take insurance and bid the vul game "|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Dbl here shows atleast same strengh as 1 NT|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With no chnace to reach the dummy this will go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew makes this difficult |pg||
nt|richie: "blood" ? :) they score in IMPS not in blood|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: uffffffff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  Maybe trump-lead can give one trick more|pg||
nt|eleni: In the open room Sigrid, sitting East played the hand and made her contract|pg||
nt|josj: in CR S was on lead and chose a spade but they missed the winning defence of a 3rd spade|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam ma³¹ satysfakcjê, ¿e pierwsze dwa rozdania w turnieju bryd¿a sportowego Asia rozegra³a przeciwko mnie przed 12 laty|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4 loser Hand so upgraded to 2C|pg||
nt|doks: 3NT very good in closed room, only 9 triks in 4@H withot defencive help|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Good start ther to play @s|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|oosb: Backward induction of sorts :)|pg||
nt|oosb: But this is a very good pass, indeed even 3@S is not completely safe|pg||
nt|richie: 1@c = natural or balanced hands, 2@c forced to 2@d|pg||
nt|zebutin: would he? with 2card support to partners major and only 1 entry?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: north might consider a canape @s lead - but @d looks automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: I dislike this strong2 2@C|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello richard|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome back|pg||
nt|richie: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|szalay:  but he has at least 2@Ds and 2 @s..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Regarding what happened - 5 @D was a genious bid...|pg||
nt|uttam: but u look at 12 with  q singleton, n 109x + q empty suit= i dont think any one should be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|oosb: Good have, @H lead, AQ@H, ruff a @H, A@D, A@C , etc etc|pg||
nt|spenny80: she hasn't information to exclude @d lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: defence will take their 5 tricks quickly i expect|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena has good hearts but otherwise lots of loosers, minimum values and "wasted" @dQx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Ofc W could be stronger also :)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: well... i would argue this in this match|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bebechira: Schwartz in 3nt|pg||
nt|eliran_a: only if west had 3 hearts 4@h could go down on a @s lead now as the cards set nothing can take it down|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3nt looks beatable|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT can be defeated with a @clead or return, 4@h is shaky but it should make|pg||
nt|richie: Madala fears @cA is wrong for him...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|raghavan: 5 D is likely to make |pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow...this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|iceblue: @S mb double it|pg||
nt|raghavan: IN THIS TABLE SWEDEN GIVES BACK WHAT IT GOT IN DEAL1|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But it will not helped this time|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eleni: one of those hands again:)|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|loe48: faar vel 12 naa|pg||
nt|josj: 3@C looks a good spot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 5D had better play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Sr. +3|pg||
nt|mrdct: the fact that EW didn't make any attempt to find a major fit might suggest a @s lead - but it usually pays to just make the normal lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: Q is correct, for only chance lead under AK|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As not all East-players open 3 @D, N/S probably would get a bad score with 500/800 anyway - so a cheap fun, we had here|pg||
nt|frankbo: så tester han kl|pg||
nt|loe48: jepp|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Operator, South's name is  Fisher|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bebechira: S in 2nt in the closed so we will have the first swing|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mancio89:  not a great return from east|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: ER  missing|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  E is 1Nt in other room|pg||
pc|h8|nt|loe48: auto 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be doubt in north's mind now about west hold 10x|pg||
nt|doks: sorry 10|pg||
nt|doks: must count more precise|pg||
nt|bcmandal: 4h better no?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Had to play D the other way|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a club now|pg||
nt|richie: but he has no other chance then playing 2@d, and a @c to K|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3off for 500?|pg||
nt|eliran_a: if madala is playing now @s to the ace he will probably would go down as west jump with the @HA and plays a club for ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|doks: and now 11 also|pg||
nt|chick: even that wouldn't have saved him|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dagold: and easts is robertson|pg||
nt|ntmon: declar can to ruff two @H in hand an make the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: the 9 holds up|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosb: Agreed Uttam, was a well judged pass by both North and South, well done|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: 10 may have been a better card than 9 for west to play at trick 2|pg||
nt|spenny80: Same Junior will overcal 2@h in south...|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|richie: intesting line of play :) she's playing rather fast|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: @hs might be 5-1|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakie to wszystko jeszcze przypadkowe u tych mlodziaków - po 4@C pi³ka by³a wystawiona, blok zgubiony i walimy w aut????|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: now OK|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  The problem with upgrade 1Nt in S position that is N often upgrade and often bid 3 Nt very hard|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|raghavan: gave up|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 1 down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bebechira: East in 3nt in the open room...same lead Qh|pg||
pc|s7|nt|runnerup: so bad guess|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|richie: probably she did not play the K|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eleni: good play by Judith:)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, 5@h is only made when you have no heart loosers|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ntmon: key play was a club to K in case E has less than 4 hearts |pg||
nt|eleni: she has to keep it up cross-ruffing though |pg||
nt|josj: what is (not) happening?|pg||
nt|eleni: Minko?|pg||
nt|eleni: what is happening pls?|pg||
nt|zebutin: Italy trailing by 14 vp leading Israel...so they would need big wins from last 3 rounds to get to 1st place|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|richie: also a nice lead, maybe it will be a push then|pg||
mc|10|nt|rodal f: Could have made 7 tricks, but.....|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room in 5d ..better chances|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Because he knows where tha points is in East hand|pg||

nt|pinticus: 2@d?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I was wrong, but I would never take a bet on 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe he sorted one of his @D to his @H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: probably not the 6 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: he should have taken another dia and put it to the hearts as well and bid game :)|pg||

nt|eleni: the ruffs did not cost any extra tricks for the defense anyway|pg||
nt|gio 89: hi everybody|pg||
nt|bebechira: E rushed with the clubs ace....|pg||
nt|bebechira: just came home ...dinner time in Oz|pg||
nt|richie: only chance is @cQx then playing J from dummy is not helping|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might not. OR at 3NT and @H lead as well|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So no misdefence  here|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Declarer could play D for K in S or J in N singletons|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Action hand!|pg||
nt|oosb: NS semi-balanced, but look at EW hands!|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT opening here in south, you have major rebid problems if you open 1 minor|pg||
nt|marionmi:  EW can make 4@s here but the 1N opening might create difficulties getting there|pg||
nt|marionmi:  and 5@d by NS is a good save, has some chances of making but not today|pg||
nt|richie: depends if Magdalena Ticha decides to bid 2@c for majors, then it must be easy for east to bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 4 imps for the Dutch girls|pg||
nt|richie: 6@s here in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Fish got his  ER       time for Robert to get his   SON|pg||
nt|dagold: NS were in 3@d in the other room on board 2 going two down...|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H+@C|pg||
nt|uttam: action hand and east is the boss|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: hi:)|pg||
nt|gio 89: we are back for 2nd half of italy-poland match|pg||
nt|richie: she decides to show just ONE major, 2@d = multi|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: looks like 1N-3N, but the @Ds don't split|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and if north leads a @S the side entry will disappear|pg||
nt|bebechira: Cook out...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: italy doing not so good, down 36 at the moment|pg||
nt|gio 89: (you will excuse me if i won't be 100% impartial :) )|pg||
nt|bebechira: she could've created a problem for -2 ...|pg||
nt|richie: hi all|pg||
nt|richie: good morning to all|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  its 20 board in a row in this class|pg||
nt|zebutin: another matter is was there anything worth the upgrade for...atleast was lacking in intermediates|pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H seems to make, so lets see if they can find it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bebechira: hi Richard|pg||
nt|richie: hi Traian :)|pg||
nt|richie: enjoy your meal :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use it my self as well, but only with a single honor A or K. Never with the Q or less|pg||
nt|bebechira: in the test match i mean....lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: fikk hjem 4S i åpent på første spillet|pg||
nt|uttam: guess he will play 4s|pg||
nt|eleni: those were their tricks, either way, with or without a ruff|pg||
nt|gio 89: 2@D multi here, 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|bebechira: so the Dutch girls draw the first blood|pg||
nt|bebechira: just came home...from dinner|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rodal f: En litt rar X fra nord. Kan avvente og se hva som skjer.|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S makeable on a good trump guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2@hX is also profitable :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: drug¹ satysfakcj¹ jest to, ¿e na licie moich 607 partnerów Asia nale¿y do 20% grupy z któr¹ wygra³em bryd¿owy turniej|pg||
nt|bebechira: ....Rosaline in 4d not doubled...in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: Cook out for 12... for the cricket lovers|pg||
nt|eliran_a: briman might make a try for game with his hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt get surprised, if you see 680 at alle tables on board 3|pg||
nt|richie: a very thin 2@d overcall here by east in these vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: oh puppet stayman, I keep forgetting that|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3 @s can be dwfeated here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45:  690 if you are a "tuff" pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Murat|pg||
nt|oosb: if they cash AK@D and switch to @H though|pg||
nt|doks: here probably NT partscore for NS, but can made game on perfect guess|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes D not good enough the other way declarer played properly|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: he wont have an entry to finesse @C and get rid of @H|pg||
nt|bebechira: i can see the dutch girls lost 11 on 17|pg||
nt|iceblue: puppet 3@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3Nt better|pg||
nt|bebechira: Ida thought for a while and passed 4d |pg||
nt|bebechira: so first blood in the 2nd set goes to the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: N probably upgraded his hand to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|richie: they may even get to 4@s, dbl-ed in south?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|rodal f: Are those 3rd and 4th hand slight opening. Whome to win.|pg||
nt|loe48: he will pass or bid 2d now|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would've opened the south hand|pg||
nt|spenny80: 5/4/2/2?|pg||
nt|spenny80: mhmh|pg||
nt|bebechira: Richard will update us during the match with the profiles of the Dutch girls... we hope|pg||
nt|richie: south knows partner is 3rd seat and should pass 3@d IMO|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she might have bid majors with 6@s and 4@h, so she can bid 2@s next|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR the 3NT also with 6 tr.  Could have made a push by making 7. Going for the @C|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR @CQ is the lead|pg||
nt|runnerup: -west argees and 500?|pg||
nt|richie: west has a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Even a slamtry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: hei|pg||
nt|uttam: no way the defence will let this make|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually either red suit lead wouldve worked fine|pg||
nt|oosb: The duck should ask for @H switch I think|pg||
nt|uttam: with visible west dummy|pg||
nt|oosb: But south can see the @c threat|pg||
nt|richie: I try - I know Magdalena Ticha just a bit better than Sigrid Spangenberg :)|pg||
nt|richie: yes, extremely wild board - please look at the movie|pg||
nt|richie: oof... 2@c not really my choice here - you really like to play in hearts, so 3@h is IMO a better bid, lucky that Sigrid somehow found a 3@c bid|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT now? and then 4@h|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think I like 3N with the E hand even though there is a remote chance of finding a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gio 89: they will probably end up in 4@s, lanzuisi not going to go any furhter|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will be upset about this |pg||
nt|richie: she will not for sure|pg||
nt|richie: Dutch a bit safer now for the silver medal and sweden has to watch out not to loose bronze to France, every IMP can make a different between medal / no medal or the colour of it|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now should be fine|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N and find partner with xx in @S or @C :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: either a weak two or a red 2-suiter depending on what my system was|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|doks: good passive lead|pg||
nt|bcmandal: can he makes it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2NT is just checkback in case S raised on three - i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1st seat green vs red you must|pg||
nt|spenny80: good valuetion in south: i like a game  try with her good @h|pg||
nt|richie: west is showing 14-17 with 6@h4@c, east is bidding every bit of her card|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re:)|pg||
nt|richie: we are back- apparently some conn problems in Albena|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: slammish hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry 480/490|pg||
nt|oosb: and has Q@H himself, so can afford to play another @D, and let North play @H|pg||
nt|eleni: an ambituous game|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S is playable but it will probably fail|pg||
nt|eleni: as the @sK is off side and it's a mirror hand also|pg||
nt|mrdct: rewarded with 2 working hooks and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|bebechira: no chance of making this|pg||
nt|richie: 3NT has no play, Carole and Claire (NS) should be able to cash their spade tricks|pg||
nt|richie: Magdalena hoping too much for better spades with her partner|pg||
nt|marionmi:  the 1N opening did its work|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is a good sacrifice against 4@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  most likely 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  a normal lead  but @s lead would be the best |pg||
pc|h2|nt|richie: nice lead...|pg||
nt|bebechira: another big swing for the french girls looming|pg||
nt|richie: 2 down is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: and we will have almost a draw soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: dror have a nice hand but still his daimonds are useless|pg||
nt|eliran_a: not a good hand to raise with for a game|pg||
nt|zebutin: they sailed in to 5@H on other room, so might be good gain for Netherlands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|2hplus4: Good lead when dummy is known to be short in D|pg||
nt|richie: is 3@h semi-natural? east could also bid 3@d as invitation|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 2 down if the defence finds the @h ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|spenny80: in north strange decision: 4@h else 3Nt with 4-3-3-3... but work well here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|murat e: depends on the trump queen which is well placed for slam bidders|pg||
nt|gio 89: looks like 4@S will make 10tricks|pg||
nt|gio 89: unless a particular trump play|pg||
nt|bebechira: France 2 vps behind at the moment|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: @HJ ain't the wourst |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3h in closed as well , by S as well|pg||
nt|richie: @s back is giving the tempo, it seems EW had to try for some club ruff, but I don't see how it could go down when declarer guesses the @h|pg||
nt|raghavan: It is great Youngsters are in Bridge in Europe|pg||
nt|bcmandal: now c|pg||
nt|richie: @H2 is a clear indication|pg||
pc|c6|nt|richie: I am surprised a bit by the 4@s bid by Magdalena Ticha, 4@h would be more descriptive - she usually bids it with these hands|pg||
nt|doks: not easy, but @D are right suit to start|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ntmon: with HCP 12-12 and 4-4 M fit you could not stay out the game - this is the rule|pg||
nt|eleni: nowhere to discard the losing @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: disappointment coming|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|uttam: hi w/c|pg||
nt|oosb: Ah ! Hi |pg||
nt|gio 89: should make just 10 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bebechira: most probably -2 if she is not going after the hearts|pg||
nt|bcmandal: had he played k?|pg||
nt|doks: @H are blocked now, can be hard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|richie: maybe she hoped that opps would dbl 4@s or overbid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  Next|pg||

pc|d9|nt|bebechira: wow...|pg||

nt|loe48: og det er lag stil|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @D10 was correct. Else S wouldn't used the @HK|pg||
nt|oosb: But was a decent contract and a good try|pg||
nt|richie: same as France :) they have always been one of the top nations two - it's always exciting when they meet and show both quite natural but good bridge|pg||
nt|bebechira: slam time|pg||
nt|raghavan: smae result in Open room|pg||
nt|richie: North's active contribution in the  bidding helped a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: easy 6nt|pg||
nt|richie: yeps, seems likely to be a push - too many points and 1 ace missing|pg||
nt|richie: they dealt some wild boards for us today|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry z Czech...ludziom takim jak ja Czechy i S³owacja zlewaj¹ siê jedno:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Morning all|pg||
nt|josj: 3nt for EW|pg||
nt|bebechira: same sequence in the open room... Fisher thinking what to do|pg||
nt|richie: another light opening? or preempt in east?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dagold: good morning Alan|pg||
nt|rodal f: For de som vil følge flere bord: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|richie: north has 11 hcp but it's good enough for opening the hand |pg||
nt|richie: 4@s is a make in NS, EW do well to "sacrifice"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr Gronkvist is biased for obvious reasons, so you need to cheer for Israel, Andy :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: and he bid 4nt...this can be a big swing for Italy|pg||
nt|runnerup: in 4 @s -you must avoid @s finess -|pg||
nt|eliran_a: yea , its becoming more and more common to respond the opening bid with negative hands , less then 6 points |pg||
nt|richie: I would dbl in south, your hearts are a bit too weak to bid them and you have some alternatives|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loe48: spade switch was better than many would think..they forced ace out of dummy|pg||
nt|richie: west will give a mixed raise with 3@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: should play in part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: East in 2s in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes upto 3 Spades possible- |pg||
nt|richie: 2NT - 3@c // 3NT - 4NT // pass is my guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the destiny of this hand|pg||
nt|eliran_a: also x from north here|pg||
nt|richie: anyhow, west will bid 4@s, no matter what, north dbl I think |pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: but down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|richie: or not :) maybe she decided for 2@h because of her 4333 also sensible|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H and @S home so a nice sac at 5@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, rah rah|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 NT will only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|loe48: det kommer nok 2nt naa|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS may stretch for a vul game here|pg||
nt|richie: partner opens 1@c and you hold this south hand :) you're not stopping under 6 anymore!|pg||

nt|eliran_a: this should be end the action|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: kolata did well not to interfere since he was on lead|pg||
nt|murat e: against 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close your eyes and play @C towards your Jack - and good luck, with @D-tricks in East|pg||
nt|loe48: and prevented him to get to 2 good clubs|pg||
nt|josj: or maybe not as S holds @CAK|pg||
nt|spenny80: now in south?|pg||
nt|mrdct: south a little bit in the dark now with a nice preempt by west|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@d denies 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|richie: puppet stayman auction|pg||
nt|doks: very nice fitted hands, but dont see reason 4@S bid|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and a heart lead looks normal|pg||
nt|zebutin: not much competition for 4@S in N/S...making (and might make even overtrick)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: At OR NS in 2NTN|pg||
nt|bebechira: same spot in the closed...now to make it|pg||
nt|richie: 4@H will be easy with @s finesse working|pg||
nt|andyv:  with W on lead, this can't be touched as E has no entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an attractive suit to lead from|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will at least stop any chances for overtricks|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I 've great fan of Israel way to play bridge|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But not in this match|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A tough choice for W there|pg||
nt|andyv:  being Greek, I was rooting for Zambia|pg||
nt|richie: only when declarer decides to finesse in @s he may go down|pg||
nt|runnerup: quess to do make/ down -spades finess -or club J -south|pg||
nt|eliran_a: Birman 2@s openening is a good weak 2 8-10 points |pg||
nt|eliran_a: sry only in 1st and 2nd seat . so here its weak 2 6-10|pg||
nt|richie: even in 3rd?|pg||
nt|zebutin: most likely they now get 2@H + @H ruff for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat e: hmm we can do that seeing all four hands...|pg||
nt|loe48: og 4 ganger hj er vel normalt naa og 8 stikk|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be a steal here though|pg||
nt|bebechira: now it is even easier|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: dummy always tables the jack when I lead K from KQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: B3|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: north's best move is probably to pass this but normal action is 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: very normal|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would not pass 3nt :(|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid taking the conservative approach with 11 and 4333 - 3NT won't cause inevitable problems|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|loe48: that will be a rough task to make 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now down|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he is young man man so they love attacking leads|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure he ducked?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|murat e: club queen doubleton and partner jumps on us...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Several times|pg||
nt|rodal f: Velkommen til Frank Bogen:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: i admit i would probably lead a @C|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
nt|josj: a @S shift then still makes it more difficult|pg||
nt|josj: on a neutral lead, declarer might go after the @H|pg||
nt|eleni: they have 9 tricks though, 5@h+4@d as they break +A@s|pg||
nt|gio 89: again 4@s by NS this time|pg||
nt|gio 89: AQ@C still make life a little easier for declearer|pg||
nt|richie: yes, overtrick is born - Puillet unlucky to find partner with such a weak suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fisher was unable to read @S8|pg||
nt|bcmandal: dbl then jump raise should w pass?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ntmon: after @CA there comes @S shift|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we are|pg||
pc|d5|nt|loe48: hvis han skulle stoppe i hj, er det bare aa proeve for 8de stikk i spar|pg||
nt|josj: Ok Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|eleni: just 3@h but now with this lead it's easier|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|spenny80: Also south can pass (no 5@s in north and 3NT is unprobably)|pg||
nt|spenny80: to assure points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He thought it was from shortage|pg||
nt|andyv:  who needs to read?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be very expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It looks silly to duck, but if West had 8x and @CA it was necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it is no error, just an unfortunate guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  then you congratulate W on a great lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Their lead is 1,3,5  and 2/4 through decl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andy, I think the 8 is more likely to be from 85 than from AQ85|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I honestly don't think that Fisher did anything wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  you may convince me Roland, but that would also assume that W had the A of @c and decided to lead a worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now Mike is thinking could Lothan really duck from Kxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunately for the defense, W can actually shift here and have time to correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an unreasonable lead from a doubleton once dummy did not stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is a good chance that partner has long spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|doks: 1@S is free bid, so 3@S must be invitational, then W have minimum|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosb: I dont like the play though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely this is a steal though|pg||
nt|richie: both north players bid 4NT, taking the initiative|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups - bad discard the @H 2|pg||
nt|richie: south obviously is looking for the @d cue|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oosb: -2 now on a @d back|pg||
nt|bebechira: 10 tricks in the closed...so 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing strong K we lead the Q here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|richie: seems to be too difficult, you have the majority of the points and quick tricks in defence - I have sympathy for not finding the sacrifice|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: tabeli|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eleni: still if ducked twice.......|pg||
nt|richie: 6NT is a slightly better bid I think, to protect @dK|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|uttam: well  west was not thinking|pg||
nt|spenny80: sometimes you can make 3NT (xxxxxx@c or like) but bidding a new double you don't arrive at 3NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...flat board and next :)|pg||
nt|richie: small @d lead by Magdalena Ticha?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: Some players would overcall 1@s with the south hand but these Israeli players are very sound|pg||
nt|oosb: needed some @C ruffs|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello Shirley :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: God morgen|pg||

nt|bcmandal: and a doubletin|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|bebechira: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890|pg||
nt|eliran_a: daimond ruff and a club and he will make it any other play he is going down|pg||
nt|richie: @cQ could work, as one kib suggested|pg||
nt|bebechira: Alon will make this|pg||
nt|richie: no, after diamond ruff, north just takes the club and plays a spade through|pg||
nt|eliran_a: so actually he cant make it anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: declarer made this difficult for him self -but still chances like all see |pg||
nt|eliran_a: cuz he if ruffs a daimond and plays a club N wins and return a spade |pg||

mb|p|nt|eleni: and no swingsin the last 3 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira: South in 3nt in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: a spectator said : Delle Cave made this.... i can not argue this|pg||

nt|ntmon: Judith is optimitic in general? :)|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board... NS will compete in diamonds, EW in @c, maybe even to 4th level|pg||
nt|rodal f: With -1 by a @H lead?|pg||
nt|doks: must be same outcome, 7card @S opposit opening bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: good bridge, dont mind the 4@S's|pg||
nt|richie: partner has a good diamond suit, AKxxxx can be enough with your 2 aces|pg||
nt|eliran_a: easy 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: she has such a nice hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: S will not pass this|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco in 4s...he must make to minimize the loses|pg||
nt|szalay:  all pass, I predictÅ±he will make it: 3@Cs, 3@D, 1-1 majors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gio 89: I may have competed to 2@s with E's hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5c in the closed by W|pg||
nt|richie: or even 5, west has a strong hand (knowing partner is short in spades)|pg||
nt|richie: they play TO dbls... otherwise West could have X-ed, maybe east can X this?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: doubleton QJ are dubious values so I like the pass|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  100 against this is no good - 130 are sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In practice 5 @D will make, the 13th @S will save the contract, and East canÂ´t attack @C|pg||
nt|frankbo: 3 rut e nok krav|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@S = weakest hand possible|pg||
nt|josj: why? isn't that expressed by "pass" any more?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lose 1@d, 1@h and 2@s i think here|pg||
nt|bebechira: clubs break nicely for Jamilla so she will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be a 1 imp swing here|pg||
nt|zebutin: couple ducks in @C to save entries?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: 3@D bør være krav. Ellers kommer lebensol inn i bildet.|pg||
nt|josj: if 1@S already shows 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: pass by W?|pg||
nt|richie: how would you bid the north hand Traian? 2@d followed by 3@d or immediately 3@d? (my choice)|pg||
nt|bebechira: probably she feels she has another bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: some imps will come for the Dutch I think|pg||
nt|richie: south needs to lead a heart, will she again find it?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  might lead a diamond |pg||
nt|bebechira: king of spades is nicely placed :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure as p was protective side |pg||
pc|h9|nt|murat e: other table club was led and 5 made|pg||
nt|loe48: ja 3ruter er nok krav, det er mest brukt slik|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@s are possible for the Netherlands, as Q@s drops, but it has to be played very carefully|pg||
nt|ntmon: that's the matter of approach|pg||
nt|richie: horrible distribution for Claire (north), 3 down is the expected result|pg||
nt|marionmi:  JT9 looks attractive|pg||
nt|richie: I guess so, @d lead seems natural|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankbo: tror han tar sine 7 nå|pg||
nt|uttam: agreed |pg||
nt|rodal f: A better color so natural lead.|pg||
nt|bebechira: and West bid 1spade|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s seems normal, needs some careful declarerplay|pg||
nt|richie: @s leads helps fortunately, now declarer has time to finesse twice in diamonds and also to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|bebechira: it is good that she is taking her time...important board|pg||

nt|loe48: it was a good lead here|pg||
nt|josj: sure but sometimes no arrival is much safer...|pg||
nt|josj: just stay at home where you are|pg||
nt|bebechira: not an inspired lead... |pg||
nt|richie: normal lead :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|raghavan: Pity East has not overtaken D|pg||
nt|bebechira: big mistake|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is the only lead to set 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  I was just told, that in practice 3 NT will make for the same reason, East will be squeezed, because only he can control the @C-suit|pg||
nt|josj: @H leads forcing dummy|pg||
nt|ntmon: if we are forced to bid at some level, the quicker we get there, the weaker we are - fast arrival rule |pg||
nt|richie: yes, I think she will raise - she never leaves an opportunity for game :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|richie: now Sigrid (east) has time to establish her clubs - won't take too long|pg||
nt|kemperg: but I ment the 4@S in N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richie: it's not a bad game looking at her own hand, if partner's @dK is placed somewhere else it has already good chances|pg||
nt|bebechira: i would bid 2d...but in Oz we are shy :)|pg||
nt|richie: lol really? :) I was playing in Oz for one year but have a completely different experience :) :) :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: if reversed vulnerability i will think harder :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|timve:  normal 4@H by south|pg||
nt|ntmon: she might have excited with @DQ|pg||
nt|ntmon: exited *|pg||
nt|eleni: a really weak pre-empt, but then as they are not vul, it sure makes life difficult for E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: disciplined 3rd seat pass by west|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 5c was a flat board...|pg||
nt|richie: firm preemptive action by Carole Puillet but very reasonable, only the 3-3 majors are against it |pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab only 3c in the closed and playing there|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s most likely spot|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess Birman was going to bid 2@C if Padon bids 1@H|pg||

nt|zebutin: they will bid 4@S again as N/S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: og ikke 3d krav til utgang|pg||

nt|mrdct: north may pass this out|pg||
nt|frankaus: cansino count suggest 4th seat pass|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe Birman can bid a "bad" 2NT here as Padon surely has a fit in one of the minors|pg||
nt|eliran_a: the action gonna end in 3cl|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c is some invitational hand with 6+@c I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: i og med de aapner lett|pg||
nt|oosb: This could get dbled|pg||
nt|ntmon: defence was soft but i can imagine EW were happy to set the contract|pg||
nt|gio 89: X by W is best decision for me|pg||
nt|richie: good suit and green vs red are favouring this pressure bid - it's difficult for opps to exchange information but as we can see it did not work here|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d is invitational|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  At the club you often see people ruffs with their small trumphs that you need later :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  dbl is @s |pg||

nt|richie: or will North do some sacrificing?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bergen from Ticha?|pg||
nt|richie: just natural|pg||
nt|richie: 8-11 6+@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|murat e: pass...|pg||
nt|murat e: 12 hcp and double fit on the bidding is too much for me to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D should be an easy winner here|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hope they do not go to slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: there 2-3 marginal boards per set///and they must be given special attention|pg||
nt|richie: 3@H or 4@H?|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h|pg||
nt|doks: 2@H is on, so going down in 3@C are not that bad|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes intreshing auction|pg||
nt|eliran_a: might be a little swing for israel in this board , N-S can make 3@s|pg||
nt|szalay:  its a must after DBL|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  See if Rubino find the killing def|pg||
nt|zebutin: @H J well positioned, so opponents can't get 3 heart tricks if declarer doesn't play that suit...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gio 89: E should know that W must have 4@D|pg||
nt|gio 89: since she didn't bid 3@s over her double|pg||
nt|gio 89: and opps should have 9card fit in @H|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1Cl was 12-14 / 18-19 Bal or Nat|pg||
nt|szalay:  what is the killing def?|pg||
nt|zebutin: hmm, yes could lead @H J to pin 10|pg||
nt|szalay:  but East is on lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: but how to get to rubinos hand?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But has no entry to do that|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|loe48: 3d er krav, derfor sier jeg at x kanskje er mer korrekt melding..og etter 3c. meld 3d som er invitt hand nu|pg||
nt|timve:  east west can maybe make 5@C|pg||
nt|timve:  but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  lets sea if E/W can defeat this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... 1nt-3c all pass|pg||
nt|richie: South surely won't :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|richie: 3@hX in the other room...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is perhaps a bit of a stretch but Cilla would have raised 3 anyway|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Remind that E just shows 6 points w the double :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s in open room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Play should not take long either He'll try to ruff D in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Lebensohl|pg||
nt|murat e: though tehe right bid here...|pg||
nt|murat e: lebensohl |pg||
nt|asig: Yes, taht was a rather lucky contract|pg||
nt|timve:  normally two spade losers|pg||
nt|timve:  but on 7x hearts....|pg||
nt|bebechira: woow|pg||
nt|richie: wow! south really doubled... now things become interesting...|pg||
nt|richie: on board 5|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... this will a swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|richie: I think 4@h is justifiable|pg||
nt|richie: but 3@h probably better in green, still need good values from partner|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will help the decl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@s should bid bye a nice 12-14 bal so |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Karlsson's @HQ at the other table was better|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  When you have KQx in trumphs you dont want ruff with them|pg||
pc|h3|nt|asig: *that|pg||
nt|asig: 4@S is makeable here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, no double, but not very nice|pg||
nt|uttam: cards are well placed for defence again|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too as they had not doubled|pg||
nt|eleni: S did not open in the open room, neither N bid anything, so E-W reached 4@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@S should make with the favorable @H lie|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad or scramble, 2N is goaad|pg||
nt|kemperg: good|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: favorable @S lie too, need two entries to finesse twice|pg||
nt|kemperg: my typing is bad today:(|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 4 of a minor makes too|pg||
nt|szalay:  generally better if u play a game when STRENGTH is on lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|loe48: de aapner med 11..saa ikke desidert krav hand|pg||
nt|gio 89: 4@s not a very thoughful bid I think|pg||
nt|gio 89: pd can't have 4@s and the suit is kinda ugly|pg||
nt|richie: East wants a spade return, so in signalling she could best take by Ace, then King, then Queen and 9|pg||
nt|bebechira: so more imps for the Dutch girls and Richard is happy :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 OR ended 3@HSX|pg||
nt|doks: same contract here as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timve:  aj|pg||
nt|timve:  now a spade discard by Ticha|pg||
nt|timve:  and I think she will pitch a spade|pg||
nt|timve:  with AK10xxxx east would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|timve:  I hardly see another line to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: any chance for an extra trick?|pg||
nt|richie: you can make an overtrick if you play the diamonds for 1 looser|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a @c in to W suit(often could be 18-19 bal) is not a good start|pg||
nt|2hplus4: These 5 major + 4 minor bids are fine if you win the auction|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: 2 tricks loss cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|bebechira: farnce 157 sweden 156 after 21 brds|pg||
nt|bebechira: france |pg||
nt|richie: yes, they overjumped them - poor swedes at the open room, they missed a few chances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: If you defend, it is almost double dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|richie: I am not sure if NS can enter the bidding, but there is a greater risk EW will play in @d|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oosb: Well I dont like the flat 14 upgraded to 1NT, unless they play a smaller range 1NT ?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  that might get expensive|pg||
nt|richie: likely to be -500|pg||
nt|richie: they led a trump which solved one problem|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mikael from Sweden recomended 6d...and right he is|pg||
nt|runnerup: but this goes dont with normal play perhaps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|doks: by the way, Denmark take 3rd place now, by leading 22-0 vs Poland|pg||
nt|zebutin: so if 4@S is played from S, and makes @H J lead this could go down...don't see that happening to any of the matches... |pg||
nt|szalay:  btw:|pg||
pc|c2|nt|richie: lol, absolutely :)|pg||
nt|richie: farce?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the it seems like 4@s should make even with a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like an overtrick now that spades are 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about making with a heart lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, W tried to pull trump immediately which cause the loss of control on hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It seems normal to cash @CAK|pg||
nt|bebechira: Di Franco going down...so 13 to Israel soon|pg||
nt|eliran_a: now he is going down|pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 3@c|pg||
pc|c7|nt|szalay:  if East doent open:|pg||
nt|szalay:  may be go down now|pg||
nt|szalay:  for small@H switch|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphpl5: lead from wrong hand|pg||
nt|murat e: kolata at the other table one off in 4 spades interesting after heart lead|pg||
nt|oosb: but once he has opened 1NT, with QJxx @H, the 3@H free bid makes sense|pg||
nt|gio 89: board looking pretty bad for us|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H King seems to come from right hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 500 enough Y|pg||
nt|szalay:  no its 3easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: B3 ended 2NTN-1 and 11IMP to Norway|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: sneaky switch|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: but west can see that everything works for declarer, so why not|pg||
nt|kemperg: only entries are in trump, that's leaders problem|pg||
pc|c9|nt|richie: but lots of work to do, Sigrid (east) is probably happy to see @HK (I would :))|pg||
nt|raghavan: On hearing a 9 card fit in Spade, others are forgotten. But Open too in Spades only|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he is home|pg||

nt|timve:  in the other room Barendregt even ducked @DQ lead.... |pg||
nt|gio 89: NS should make 4@s, conceding 1@d, 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|richie: Claire Chaugny and Carole Puillet probably solved this problem by bidding 1@s and X showing 4+@s|pg||
nt|richie: Big score for the french again...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is easier|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h K lead (not the best )|pg||
nt|2hplus4: france made 3NT on 2NT hand. declarer played a D at trick 2 which was ducked|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: just need AK of @H for 6 |pg||
nt|kemperg: tried for 6, will now bid4, S showed a minimum|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@H likely some sort of minimum|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2@d to takie silniejsze BA jak widaæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: not so easy to get there though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and makes even on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|doks: after quite partscore, doubled slam deal|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, they did open in other room too, but opened with 1@C, so S could not come in with x|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|loe48: ja, men vil de komme i topkontrakten 6nt naa med daarlig tilpass|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S fra S nå så blir det vanskelig for NS|pg||
nt|mrdct: the solitary @h stopper wont do the job here - so @s is the only viable game|pg||
nt|richie: I guess Magdalena (west) will lead a trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: still trying|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pos³uszny|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  passive bidding by N/S|pg||
nt|timve:  although I agree with both bids|pg||
nt|timve:  3@H or 2NT with south is too agressive|pg||
nt|marionmi:  now what will Ticha lead? ace of spades, trying to shorten declarer? a trump to prevent the ruffs?|pg||
nt|richie: it's often good with 4 small trumps to lead them|pg||
nt|marionmi:  you know her better than i do :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 2NTW and a swing to come.|pg||
nt|richie: we made it to some kind of rule :) 4 small trumps = trump lead|pg||
nt|marionmi:  a lot of bad breaks here|pg||
nt|chick: poor defense doesn't count :)|pg||
nt|chick: finally EW bid hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|loe48: s vet at makker har max singel ruter naa|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 slemmer står. @C - @D og NT.|pg||
nt|frankbo: tror han prøver med 6sp|pg||
nt|loe48: fordi ikke stoette fra 3 til 4d|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile Hungary picked up 7 imps in the 2@D deal|pg||
nt|eleni: Margherita is right thinking |pg||
nt|frankaus: i willl see if they are short elsewhere as there are 3 comment. here cu |pg||
nt|neobas: Surely W has a hand to get into the auction here|pg||
nt|richie: depends on your perspective|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@C=trans to me |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Counted for about 15 IMPs there!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Here a @C-lead is the only CHANCE to keep declarer to his 10 tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: this is a typical need to cash tricks contract..a slip and it makes|pg||
nt|frankbo: her må motspillet sitte|pg||
nt|frankbo: kommer nok kl ess|pg||
nt|frankbo: 10 fra håkon ,nå må sp skiftet komme|pg||
nt|loe48: yes ace of clubs are probably next|pg||
nt|loe48: he cant see his king of h as a trick yet so want a ruff|pg||
nt|eleni: but 3NT quite difficult|pg||
nt|mrdct: defending 3@hx will pay dividends|pg||
nt|marionmi:  how should she play? win in hand and play a spade?|pg||
nt|richie: interesting board, declarer has to be careful, and NOT finesse in @hs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3@d is puppet to 3@h with supp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: support for what?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a dangerous board for sweden|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 93 is not what I call support :)|pg||
nt|doks: other room Lightner double discover @S suit and @DQ as well|pg||
nt|garden2005: wist kierowy najlepszy na 3NT i na 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: unless she attacks @d early|pg||
nt|eleni: and this is what happens when one opens so light instead of a weak 2 or multi opening|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT final destination - it will be difficult enough|pg||
nt|bebechira: Magdalena pass?|pg||
nt|bebechira: but after 4c ...what can she do?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@d can be defeated, you need accurate defence: club lead, ruffed, @d to K, club ruff|pg||
nt|neobas: Peculiar X by Nab in the OR|pg||
nt|richie: @s to K|pg||
nt|richie: 3rd5th lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4h went 2 down in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 22|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: particularly on a passive defence|pg||
nt|richie: as the cards lie you can make 2@s, if you get a @h lead 1@h, 2@d and 3@c for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  something is being lost in the translation|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like we are heading to 5@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 4 cl Short @c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So we may ending very wrong here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that East meant 3@D as stopper ask after South's interference|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes she mean that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rodal f: 4@H er fort que med litt i @C. Men...... usikker.|pg||
nt|loe48: 6 kloever , 6d og 6nt staar..vil de lande paa fotene her?|pg||
nt|frankbo: sorry han melder jo self 6 kl|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks ok on the surface, but there is a forcing defense|pg||
nt|kemperg: its a 50% slam|pg||
nt|richie: I like the 1NT overcall here, even though you don't have a double stopper you have plenty of tricks available - 2@c overcall would make life much more complicated|pg||
nt|garden2005: raczej wygra niestety, przez trefle|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: korzystna pozycja trefli dla rozgrywaj¹cego - krótka 9-ka ale jeszcze trzeba trafiæ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|murat e: this must be a flat board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I said CHANCE - no good guess, indeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not after @C10|pg||
nt|timve:  only if you play Bergen|pg||
nt|spenny80: may be -1 in 3@h|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or draw trumps and take the double club hook?|pg||
nt|richie: 2 more imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 2 more imps for the dutch girls|pg||
nt|doks: @S are not in picture this deal here. Goes for @D slam probably|pg||
nt|chick: yes, counts for score but not for whether to bid it or not :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would quess kind of "puppet" sequence, 3nt telling 5c @H and 4@D transfering to it|pg||
nt|szalay:  couldnt: instead of it: didnt|pg||
nt|szalay:  I think if u have 3.3 majors, u can|pg||
nt|szalay:  yes, u can:)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now with everthing wrong for decl|pg||
nt|zebutin: this might need some help from defence|pg||
nt|szalay:  no other option than @C lead, imho|pg||
pc|h9|nt|timve:  you can bid 3@C|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT is off from the top (with a @H trick) and defence should be able to cash out|pg||
nt|richie: I guess you could better try to ruff 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  or take in dummy and start playing clubs right away?|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes same in Open too|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W continue to Que|pg||
nt|atalok: slmlar|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And a Cl lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@s on last board for Ita to|pg||
nt|szalay:  sgtrongly doubt North could switch another than @S|pg||
nt|szalay:  @D is ok if pd has stiff K/A of @H and @D honour to 3 (exactly)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|richie: I would try for that, and establish diamonds as we go|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, but then you have to win a high heart in dummy right away and you may have to ruff 1 or 2 spades with your high trumps in hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK lead was what declarer needed in the other room|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so i think he pass now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which seems a strange lead after West had shown hearts. Then the other red king looks more attractive|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba Tuczek pokryje 10-kê trefl królem?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: getting @s right the key now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ruff one seems to be enough for =|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Eller topp kontrakten. Well done.|pg||
nt|spenny80: I don't know how, but good end here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am wrong it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they are on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Yes so both swedish pair should remember board 7 |pg||
nt|atalok: yorumcu olarak sadece ben varým herhalde artýk idare edersiniz.|pg||
nt|szalay:  or AKx in @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richie: playing spades, however is not very appealing... and neither of the opps will play it for you|pg||
nt|bebechira: Judith Nab in 2c in the closed|pg||
nt|richie: that's also true- maybe @sJ9 stops the spades a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately, Johan was right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 fits at the 4-level usually don't play well|pg||
nt|doks: E expected more from W 3@D bid, so both Q must be found|pg||
nt|doks: very big swing on air|pg||
nt|bcmandal: yes either way|pg||
nt|chick: or as someone points out, a simpler club ruff :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes seems Scotland may have done better than -2|pg||
nt|uttam: deal 4,5,6 are good for Hungary|pg||
nt|timve:  still north will decline the invite, missing good spots in the side suits|pg||
nt|josj: E had better bid 2nt rather than 3 if they play this sort of light opening bids|pg||
nt|2hplus4: C ruff gets it over quickly but even so declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|s4|nt|loe48: er en ok slem ..skal man vaere i slem saa er 6nt rett|pg||
nt|frankbo: rut 3-3 kl 3-3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Seems u was right.|pg||
nt|ntmon: but as in many cash-out situations, things might no go right way |pg||
nt|richie: 5@d made now, carole puillet evaluated her hand better than Judith Nab in open room with the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow... you were saying about finessing richard????|pg||
nt|richie: 4@h will go down here, @druff coming |pg||
nt|richie: I don't remember :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bebechira: why is Magdalena thinking....is this worring you?|pg||
nt|richie: not at all worrying|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: just contemplating, only problem is that @d8 can also be played from 832|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|richie: and 2nd problem is that partner encouraged in spades|pg||
nt|richie: and third...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we have seen examples of a 4-2 fit being the only makeable game|pg||
nt|doks: imagine You play vs Zia siting on S and DBL 7@D. Where You place @DQ?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: playing safely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bebechira: defeating or making is a 4 imps difference|pg||
nt|richie: @s2 is disappointing... another trump would have worked better|pg||
nt|marionmi:  would easts diamonds be count? should be lavinthal maybe|pg||
nt|richie: they show count|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR the NT ended -1|pg||
nt|richie: small swing|pg||
nt|atalok: 4 sp konturu d atagýný engelledi|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|josj: difficult to imagine for defence that E has such a bad hand...|pg||
nt|ntmon: exactly .. there danger comes from|pg||
nt|josj: and any mistake now will be fatal immediately|pg||
nt|spenny80: hi all|pg||
nt|eleni: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome@h|pg||
nt|josj: hi Fabio|pg||
nt|spenny80: thanks|pg||
nt|garden2005: pokryje, a dalej wszystko siê wysypie|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|loe48: there the slip came..he didnt want to listen to his pd's signal of switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C10 should have been a nice warning.|pg||
nt|josj: that's what I meant|pg||
nt|eleni: now Margherita is home:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: here we are :(|pg||
nt|mrdct: but @c switch when S gets in will kill dummy|pg||
nt|spenny80: need @c back to beat|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I think thier rule is to playing their ordinary system when W could bid nat 2@h but if Opps bid after the answer they play more natural like that Cilla thought|pg||
nt|doks: E was completely sure about @DQ on W, he dont even ask|pg||
nt|bcmandal: my way|pg||
nt|doks: or 6th @D|pg||
nt|bcmandal: another hurdlt|pg||
nt|bcmandal: hurdle|pg||
nt|zebutin: so one down and on to the next board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eleni: and simply take them and run:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: :)|pg||
nt|josj: interesting: S can see 9 tricks once she ducks @SJ...|pg||
nt|eleni: at times shooting an impossible contract pays back:)|pg||
nt|ntmon: of course, we know .. she should take it and play @DA  .. but ..|pg||
nt|eleni: probably never heard of the rule "3rd high" and never rescue your partner either:)|pg||
nt|richie: big swing at stake here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well 5 here and 5 there make 10 for me:)|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hmm, west can't get more than one ruff, so maybe safely was not required here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just looks like a totally normal auction|pg||
nt|loe48: det staar paa at en av farvene ordner seg|pg||
nt|richie: it seems they did not have this tool of 1@s so rosaline Barendregt decided for 2@c|pg||
nt|richie: now the problem is solved|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep...8 tricks for the taking... and 1 imp for France|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankbo: der håkon og lars spillte 3N minus fire meldte det 7kl dbl med 800|pg||

nt|loe48: kan fort skje med missfortaaelse av melding|pg||
nt|spenny80: wd|pg||
nt|mrdct: looking at that dummy - getting rid of an entry to the @d suit looks stand-out|pg||
nt|mrdct: good defence|pg||
nt|richie: 2nd problem was the biggest problem it seems|pg||
pc|h7|nt|doks: if He founds @DQ, then more probably founds @SQ as well|pg||
nt|garden2005: a mo¿e trzeba nie kryæ! wtedy jest szansa ¿e rozgrywaj¹cy zagra na ca³ego mariasza za|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: all that remains for the defence now is to duck one round of @d|pg||
nt|richie: no overcall in spades at the other table, so the contract is played in north, it could make a difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A board to forget for Sweden in both rooms. Happens to all of us|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|richie: must be a relief to make this contract|pg||

nt|2hplus4: I thought we were on a daytime cookery show|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bebechira: 12 tricks and next...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gronkvist:  so 2 down here and first good board for Isr|pg||

nt|bebechira: Netherlands and Poland fighting for the gold in the girls|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: always fun when your 2N opening gets passed out|pg||

nt|runnerup: that time -just a like hand as west had -both bid 2@d -that time and passed |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: @h vs @s here|pg||

nt|mrdct: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|richie: yes but I think even the other 3 countries (Sweden, France and Italy) have a chance for silver or even gold when they perform well in the next three matches - they all play against ...|pg||
nt|richie: each other|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think i would like 2@s here better by east than 2n, then you make partner aware of your spade shortness |pg||
nt|marionmi:  she doesnt need to have a very good spade stopper for a 1 level nt bid|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, usually 1nt is more like 8-10 in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  more interesting for us would have been what E would have done over 3@s by W|pg||

nt|doks: good news is that no one dbl|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  10 tricks now|pg||
nt|zebutin: kibitzer suggested @S J on 1st trick, which could make life easier for partner|pg||

nt|spenny80: 5@d is long with a balance hand and only 5/3 trump |pg||

nt|spenny80: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|marionmi:  this contract will make, but 2@s might make as well|pg||
nt|richie: pass over 1@d by west looks strange but her philosophy is that an overcall should be useful for the lead, @sA9xxx is worse than @sKT9xx, then she would surely overcall|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|richie: I think they looked at the results two years ago and scheduled accordingly: in the last match no 1 and 2 meet (Poland and France), no 3 and 4 (Netherlands and Sweden) etc|pg||

mb|3D|nt|2hplus4: EW make lots of tricks in C|pg||
nt|chick: I think they can make 5@C with some crossruffing|pg||

mb|p|nt|spenny80: 4@s??? over overcall 1@d?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Danes had the same horrible start against Israel yesterday but went on to win the match by 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deja vu perhaps|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for N to insist on @s contract?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Tell their captain to wake them earlier|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Is he good enough for 5C?|pg||
nt|richie: now he tells partner about the good fit and shortness in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: so no worry about ns playing this board|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@HNX. Sr|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: She should bid 4@d instead of 4 NT|pg||
nt|richie: in the meanwhile Hungary has a small margin (40- 11 imps) over Sweden, no 3 at this moment|pg||
nt|chick: the @D bid makes his singleton worth more (less chance partner has wasted values there)|pg||

nt|uttam: but he has devalued @ck|pg||
nt|oosb: yes so I like 3@H|pg||
nt|oosb: but can imagine some aggressive 4@H bidders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the x is doubtful, but hard to stay out of these auctions|pg||
nt|uttam: free 3@h bid conveys enough information to ur p|pg||
nt|oosb: Honestly against a passed partner that hand is too flat for a dbl for me|pg||
nt|oosb: So I might lose imps in this deal, but I pass as West|pg||
nt|spenny80: really?|pg||
nt|mrdct: i meant by south|pg||

pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||

nt|spenny80: with lead K@d, if when you take with Q@s don't play A@H you make 6...|pg||
nt|richie: good question by one of the kibs, where should EW have entered the auction on board 25? I have no idea... maybe 3@d overcall by east when you play it as preemptive|pg||

nt|chick: @H10 right now|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Duck and give partner H ruff still beats it 2|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @H 10 you could try to raise @S, without it might try for @H even & @D not more than 4-2, or @H 4-2 and @D 3-3/J10 doubleton... or something like that...|pg||

nt|murat e: hand is wrong|pg||

nt|galois85: good morning everybody, hi fabio!|pg||
nt|ntmon: declarer has to her tricks somewhere and could not be sure about @C position|pg||
nt|spenny80: ciao Andrea!|pg||
nt|ntmon: it doesn't look a coffee board for her|pg||
nt|eleni: @h buongiorno Andrea|pg||
nt|bebechira: France,Poland, Sweden for the dutch girls....not easy|pg||
nt|bebechira: the open room settled in 6|pg||
nt|iceblue: its hard after 3@H|pg||
nt|richie: sweden is still 3rd but cannot afford too many bad boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  but @d has to be lead somewhere so may have more play than first glance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No 3NT now it appears|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ofc |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Padon thought that partner had a long @s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  As a youngsters u dont want to miss a grand|pg||

nt|richie: lol|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H=4@S+ and 1@S=3 cards I belive.|pg||
nt|richie: I think so too|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: very surprising|pg||

pc|s7|nt|rodal f: I understand him|pg||
nt|frankbo: hadde blitt vanskelig for Ø med 3 hj fra S|pg||
nt|timve:  this pair has a better solution|pg||
nt|timve:  they use Kokish|pg||
nt|timve:  2@H is natural or very strong NT|pg||
nt|spenny80: no, She can play @h finess or @s expass|pg||
nt|richie: could be a swing board here, 6@s is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|richie: very difficult board to bid... both have a 2 suiter, you miss one ace (fortunately opposite void) and it's hard to really establish the fit|pg||
nt|richie: 1@s - 2@d // 3@c - 3@d // 4@d or 4@h may have done the job|pg||
nt|iceblue: agree|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  With AK@h and a normal @c shift |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess so but in this situation i prefer lebensohl :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: misunderstanding :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|uttam: i understand|pg||
nt|timve:  it seems E-W dont have good agreements after 2NT|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT is now played in the wrong hand, defence can take their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That does not beat it|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  this will go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|doks: N still looking for 7 if 2@D dont deny 4controls|pg||
pc|d3|nt|timve:  cause with 6HCP I would get ideas|pg||
nt|richie: at the other table Judith Nab actually opened the door for 7@d but Rosaline Barendregt firmly closed it again|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@S was a difficult bid to read safer to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: preempt worked in both rooms.. but|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S7 best now|pg||
nt|kemperg: but thats loses the controle, @C then for defenders|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: Ville ikke 3@S vert gratis. Spørsmål etter hold eller advanced que bid?|pg||
nt|uttam: no power|pg||
nt|josj: @H finesse seems best option as @C might be 5-3...|pg||
nt|bebechira: Sigrid will have problems here|pg||
nt|bebechira: still 2 vps in front|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H must be cue, with shortness, as he deny @H support|pg||
nt|doks: but they must know better their aggreements|pg||
nt|2hplus4: E trying to force rather than going for ruffs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|richie: sweden 155, france 153, italy 149 (maybe they are the 3rd dog coming for the bone?)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  No u right |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  He then set up the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for N,, he wants to lead @d and @c at same time|pg||

nt|spenny80: last board 6@s for italy and same defence|pg||

nt|bebechira: 5d is closing the door as well?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: enjoy your coffee gentlemen anyway:)|pg||
nt|richie: here it is west who is shutting the door, in open room it was east (surprisingly)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  trying to pull trumphs :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Så etter 3@S fra N kommer 4@H fra S som sier at 3@S var et advanced que.|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 now i think with the non-@c lead|pg||
nt|spenny80: ?|pg||
nt|spenny80: ah yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: the italian girls in the other room would've been better to play count on the opening @DK lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|richie: incredibly difficult board, she had to develop @h first (@h2 to J) but who can find that?|pg||
nt|richie: you have to play hearts to take north's entry for the 4th spades|pg||
nt|bebechira: club lead in the open room by Nab and Jack played|pg||
nt|richie: I was just going to say that I think south will lead @c6 :) but wrong guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3-3 @s will see this one home|pg||
nt|doks: specs suggest 4@H kick-back RKC|pg||

nt|richie: 2 VPs is nothing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Pass always at team then Frank.|pg||
nt|frankbo: y|pg||
nt|richie: Sigrid in east showed an invitational hand with 3+@s or a mild game forcing hand, maybe with 13 and a side suit she is too strong, on the other hand Magie in west could have bid ...|pg||
nt|richie: 3@d shortness|pg||
nt|rodal f: So some national Polich players have left the Polich club it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke did not see the danger|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bebechira: Rosaline in 5d dbled in the closed|pg||
nt|doks: and A ask more frequently use strong hand rather than weak|pg||
pc|cA|nt|richie: 500 and 1 imp to france I guess|pg||
nt|richie: 2 imps|pg||
nt|richie: might be a swing to france again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can't ruff 2 diamonds if they play another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he should have realised that and played on spades|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  ouch to fast play here from his side|pg||
nt|richie: only  hope for Padon was the singleton honour in @s|pg||
nt|bebechira: Massimilliano in 5d in brd 9 so that will be flat|pg||
nt|eliran_a: good lead by delle cave , club lead give and the contract makes ,declerer needs to play J@c from dummy |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bebechira: may be 2|pg||
nt|chick: good forcing technique, duck until win dummy's last trump|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: unblock the @dA and then keep drawing trumps|pg||

nt|spenny80: @c are 4/4 or Aces is in north (with Axx in south probably she takes on 1st round)|pg||
nt|josj: and another imp for Italy...|pg||
nt|josj: Judith?|pg||
nt|bebechira: Denmark defeated Israel in the juniors .. 19-11 so Israel lead is now 'only'14 VPS|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Netherland picked up a new 6 IMPer at B8|pg||

nt|richie: aha, no, east can open 1NT first - will be playing 2@s|pg||
nt|doks: normal 2@H, must be duplicated here as well|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not?|pg||
nt|runnerup: some douthloking values in east but 4@h must be didden and makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3nt with @d guess or lead here|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@c = gazzilli|pg||
nt|richie: south has a lot of trumps, but that's all, I guess she will pass in these vulnerabilities, north may dbl?|pg||
nt|richie: everyone passing? maybe 1@s - 2@c pass|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|spenny80: 2@d positive|pg||
nt|richie: no, passing wisely|pg||
nt|bebechira: n will double|pg||

nt|richie: just made, good result for the French girls Carole and  Claire, they avoided any tragedies|pg||
nt|kemperg: I do, but dont see it much|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like a push board , 10 tricks in 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: incredibil.... N is playing in 4s in the closed|pg||
nt|atalok: þimdide 12 de  10|pg||
nt|zebutin: N opening, most likely last contract seem to be 3nt...@C A favorably positioned|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankbo: som GEO sier, 4 rut må være cue med hj, kanskje beste varianten|pg||
nt|richie: 3@c in east and 3NT by west is my guess - but 2@s is also possible of course|pg||
nt|chick: yes, preempt bids are based on length and the Law of Total Tricks|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I guess 2N is a @H raise, though I don't understand why not 2@S|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  me to :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|timve:  hmm with north you would like to bid|pg||
nt|timve:  double as t/o is the way to do it|pg||
nt|timve:  also 2NT cannot be natural in this situation|pg||
nt|timve:  north is thinking about it|pg||
nt|timve:  3@D is down one|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c = 5/4 (not 6/4 not 5/5)|pg||
nt|spenny80: strong|pg||
nt|spenny80: 1Nt is better the dbl|pg||
nt|mrdct: east might be expecting 4@h from west|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|richie: you need some tricks to make this contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Israel 275-Italy 261-Denmark 235 the medals at the moment|pg||
nt|chick: that's why making a weak 2 bid with a 7 card suit is silly|pg||
nt|chick: and why opening 4@S with a 7 card suit is dangerous|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: biedna staroæ czeka cz³owieka, który w m³odoci prezentów nie przyjmuje|pg||
pc|h2|nt|timve:  at the other table a very nice lead from Barendregt on board 10 |pg||
nt|mrdct: but 2@h will play OK|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s? :)|pg||
nt|richie: south in open room has GREAT courage!!! she bids 2@c for majors|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT! that's again modest|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: kib suggests he's afraid of it being passed |pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Puppet on so 5@Ss|pg||
nt|timve:  defeating the contract instantly|pg||
nt|spenny80: in particular with K@s lead :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: west does have a hand better for playing in a suit contract|pg||
nt|richie: can Italy still challenge Israel, you think?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|spenny80: probably with 3@c denies 3@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: but i'm not sure|pg||
nt|kemperg: since last board understandeble:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|marionmi:  she will make some tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|asig: Way too passive by North imo|pg||
nt|richie: the advantage of 3@c (forcing to game) is that you show your fit immediately, 2NT would have been lebensohl, showing a variety of weaker hands|pg||
nt|bebechira: nope.. I think the israelis are very strong...they will not give it away after such a start|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: anyway, this should make comfortably, and a small gain for israel|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Kanskje GEO vil hjelpe oss litt? Velkommen.|pg||
nt|loe48: 4h and 4s|pg||
nt|rodal f: que|pg||
nt|frankbo: will bidd 6 now|pg||
nt|frankbo: 1 down|pg||
nt|richie: difficult lead for North, I would be tempted to lead @hQ|pg||
nt|richie: small @c to K and 3 rounds of clubs, then @dA and diamond? maybe north is tempted to jump by Q|pg||
nt|marionmi:  around 8 is my guess|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marionmi:  yes but even that isnt enough if north keeps her spades|pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, south has 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: strefa szlemowa na drugim stole pozostawia trochê do ¿yczenia|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  the right plan was to ruff 2 @d and 2@s before pulling the trumphs and then palyed a@hJ and N was endplayed (from Johan Upmark)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|richie: 2@s however suggest 5@h, if east had bid 3@c then @hQ is more reasonable|pg||
nt|richie: are you kidding me?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  what should she discard on the 3 clubs? a diamond, a heart and a spade?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't think your rigid views are mainstream|pg||
pc|s9|nt|loe48: if he raise club ace it makes|pg||
nt|spenny80: now 5@c i think|pg||
nt|spenny80: little try|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... big misunderstanding|pg||
nt|atalok: polish atak|pg||
nt|atalok: 94 den 4 atak ediyorlar þimdi mecburen ortadan atak ediyor |pg||

nt|frankbo: y or H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankbo: well|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even not by raising @CA u have a squize endplay.|pg||
nt|frankbo: could still endplay E|pg||
nt|loe48: still possibilities id say|pg||
nt|loe48: draw 9 cards in spade and dia..so whats left|pg||
nt|ntmon: still tempting for W|pg||
nt|spenny80: difficult for W not accept|pg||
nt|richie: yes, probably - even 2 hearts is OK|pg||
nt|richie: you can see that dummy is inaccessible|pg||
nt|doks: Must leave right now. Big thanks for excellent company and valuable contribution from specs, was pleasure|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|josj: can W be sure of 2 aces opposite?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|spenny80: :O|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian girls are well prepared concerning bidding system - my conclusion|pg||
nt|richie: I don't know the leads well enough, could @sT be from AJT? I guess not... |pg||
nt|richie: NS now need to establish the @h trick before it disappears... easier for North to see it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: ok thats for that game nice peaceful a couple off down like 2 ..|pg||
nt|loe48: east need to blank club ace|pg||
nt|rodal f: Welcome back from space:)|pg||
nt|eleni: well stopped by W|pg||
nt|spenny80: I think no, but E has made i slam try with sgl in @h.... she will had a good reason|pg||
nt|galois85: in the other table e omit the hearts cue bid, I think since in the first suit of the partner. Flavia knowing about the singleton of her p can evaluate differently her hand...|pg||
nt|bebechira: i am not kidding you...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  Players need to determine whether the A or the K is a "strong" lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  here 2@h was 8-11|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|timve:  well maybe 3NT was also not the best contract on board 10|pg||
nt|spenny80: in this board they have chance: 6@c is a good slam|pg||
nt|spenny80: @c lead is better for N/S|pg||
nt|richie: this will make now, courage has been rewarded and 6 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: 3NT probably plays quite well though with the @d suit sitting nicely|pg||

nt|loe48: send the man some cookies|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: without spades, south will be inclined to pass|pg||
nt|spenny80: A chance lost|pg||
nt|spenny80: Poland play very well|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be a 3rd seat opener for south here|pg||
nt|richie: I heard the french girls are in 2@c on board 12 - chance for the dutch to pick up some valuable imps|pg||
nt|bebechira: I am very sorry , but i have to say good night...almost 1am here and tomorrow ..work:(|pg||
nt|richie: good night Traian :) thanks again for your great efforts!|pg||
nt|bebechira: thx all for watching and good night from Melbourne|pg||
nt|rensph: hi all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: well I'm sure N will feel better that his bid was endorsed by the LOTT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A board for Rana Avis Frank?|pg||
nt|loe48: well done Johansen!|pg||
nt|josj: a good saved available here for EW, even vul.|pg||
nt|spenny80: do you make 2 suiter with E?|pg||
nt|richie: ladies and gentlemen, another wild hand!|pg||
nt|richie: 2NT would be @d+@h, perfect hand for it :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  heheh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: bid|pg||
nt|josj: if Margherita can take action now...|pg||
nt|ntmon: surely worth it|pg||
nt|spenny80: seeing that, I feel old|pg||
nt|josj: what about me?|pg||
nt|josj: at mp  it would be different|pg||
nt|spenny80: y|pg||
nt|spenny80: could be|pg||
nt|marionmi:  i think she will|pg||
nt|marionmi:  then 3@s-5@d?|pg||
nt|richie: that would shut out NS bidding completely |pg||
nt|marionmi:  oh sorry, 1@c|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 nt in open room |pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosb: Another example of a pushy dbl|pg||
nt|spenny80: yes, but isn't mp|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's easier to adapt your bidding methods than give away your years |pg||
nt|mrdct: some goods 10s and 9s|pg||
nt|richie: horrible hands!! they open multi and EW face these hands... |pg||
nt|richie: dbl probably and then 5@d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  but south will bid something, wont she?|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yes, and then its up to north|pg||
nt|marionmi:  who hasnt shown any suit yet|pg||
nt|chick: unlucky this time, happens, but EW had a 6@D slam too|pg||
nt|eliran_a: 13|pg||
nt|eliran_a: undo sir|pg||
nt|bebechira: KD lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I can only agree :)|pg||
nt|richie: north will just do 5@s, solid enough|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|marionmi:  ticha trying to trap the opponents?|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably not the contract here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|richie: 3@c now and then 3NT would work well and is likely  to happen|pg||
nt|marionmi:  into doubling them?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer X with all points outside|pg||
nt|chick: by the way, the LoTT for preempts assumes that partner has his fair share of the remaining cards in the suit.  In that hand, it didn't happen|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Then does the LOTT not work if partner does not do his bit by contributing a massive dummy? :)|pg||
nt|chick: massive not required, two spades would have helped a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|spenny80: in other room netherlands girl think as me|pg||
nt|ntmon: may die out at 5@S|pg||
nt|richie: well bid |pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 tricks :(|pg||
nt|richie: 6 or even 7@d is making, you need to rebid @ds for that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankbo: hehe|pg||
nt|oosb: But then again, I'm never opening this 1@C|pg||
nt|josj: should not be too difficult to locate @CQ|pg||
nt|josj: E will be known to hold 5-5-2-1|pg||
nt|spenny80: with 2 suiter in est and seeing 2@s in E, Q@c can't pay|pg||
nt|josj: but 6@D is still OK|pg||
nt|spenny80: 6@d?|pg||
nt|josj: -2 I think|pg||
nt|richie: maybe:)|pg||
nt|richie: then you should pass again|pg||
nt|marionmi:  north didnt take this opportunity to bid her spades|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I like 1@H ni the other room more than I like 2@D|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In copen room Lothan said pass|pg||
nt|atalok: en sevdigim deklerasyon eski günlerdeki gibi.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: spade lead?|pg||
nt|richie: 4@s minus 7 I am told, so 7 imps to France   Crazy match...|pg||
nt|richie: take it or leave it|pg||
nt|marionmi:  4d|pg||
nt|marionmi:  hmmm|pg||
nt|antoniz: czas na pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3 times @c gives defence a chance|pg||
nt|loe48: et pent spill|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 spade is a tranfer response|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT by EW likely contract|pg||
nt|bebechira: tes 3 tricks scored.... you hoped for 6|pg||
nt|bebechira: new leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Antoni jak rymujesz to w jednym jêzyku proszê:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this takes care of the @c loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B9 Netherland picked up a new 6IMPer. Norway need to fight well now.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, hold on, this 4 have just passed a hand out|pg||
nt|spenny80: better 4@s in west else 5@d....|pg||
nt|richie: declarer has to take care of her communication - she can pick up 4@h tricks but needs to be careful with her @d entry|pg||
nt|richie: 4@d is again a bit modest, the void in @h doesn't encourage her I think|pg||
nt|marionmi:  yeah but still|pg||
nt|antoniz: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|murat e: 3 dia is the best spot but how to get there|pg||
nt|spenny80: but here is the same|pg||
nt|spenny80: normal|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably the same outcome if south did open|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Its only Swe and Austria who stoped at 6 Nt and lost 13imps on board 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  1N somehow showed hearts?|pg||
nt|richie: 5@dX is my guess, bidding went slow enough |pg||
nt|richie: north never showed her extra values, 3NT will be the end|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|murat e: not possible w standart bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: good play|pg||
nt|murat e: covering costs a trick|pg||
nt|murat e: some spec suggests 2 dia instead of 2 sp but matchpoint bidding is not that way|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  @S is best |pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And now padon has takaway NS suit|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 1 too much |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|timve:  interesting contract|pg||
nt|timve:  if declarer takes in her hand|pg||
nt|bebechira: good lead|pg||
nt|eliran_a: normal bid of 3@s by west and a good lead by north whice means the contract gonna fail by 1 trick|pg||
nt|atalok: batý ilk cl i alýnca H dönüþünü bulursa batýrýr|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you open this ligth you always have to be carefull|pg||
nt|zebutin: and once has been bid only fullgame on that...so even juniors can know restraint...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  Looks like there is a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|richie: 5@s is down on a @h lead, bridge can be a funny game|pg||
nt|richie: but 6@d makes and would therefore be a good sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|timve:  and takes a heart finesse|pg||
nt|antoniz: z rêk¹ N mo¿na sobie Staymana darowaæ|pg||

nt|richie: nicely done|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: In Italy spades are like cross|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  And 6 nt in open room here so a flat one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|asig: A chance to hold the contract to 10 tricks, that is :)|pg||
nt|richie: DBL probably asking for an unusual lead, but they did not discuss this together|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  and 3@c would have been down a bunch|pg||
nt|bebechira: you went quiet Richard ?|pg||
nt|richie: 1NT in the meanwhile makes comfortably|pg||
nt|marionmi:  still down on a heart return|pg||
nt|richie: @dQ on the K :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c pitch seems automatic, whether W can ruff or not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: no reason to not continue with what partner lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  now W has a @c to exit with|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ntmon: i wd appreciate 4@S by W - showing some offensive extras |pg||
nt|spenny80: 1@d pass 1@h pas pas 1NT.....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|richie: Q is an alarming card, 9 still too vague|pg||
nt|marionmi:  spangenberg wont think her partner has 5 diamonds, so i think she should play the queen to show something weird is going on|pg||
nt|marionmi:  9 might also be neutral from Q9x|pg||
nt|richie: unlucky @c break dooms the contract|pg||
nt|rensph: 3@D will probably make, will be a big win for France with the sharp 3NT in the other room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marionmi:  oops|pg||

mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: but well done to make 1N here|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well, I am not sure 2N says hearts...|pg||
nt|spenny80: ok correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s not a ridiculous spot here|pg||
nt|richie: Poland doing extremely well, even scoring big numbers against the top countries|pg||
nt|andyv:  marginal opener for S|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 1NT is supposedly 15-17, I don't particulaly like this upgrade|pg||
nt|runnerup: with spades 4-2 and hearts 2-2- should have been easy,but who am i to say ..|pg||
nt|eliran_a: maybe after this opening lead by madala his partner will push for a small slam in @c whice fails only in @s lead|pg||
nt|eliran_a: opening bid *|pg||
nt|bobholl: how to bid 4@S ?|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|murat e: also 3 nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: B11. Same open same X but S bidded 3@H where S passed here. 3@S came and pass around.|pg||
nt|spenny80: dou you rebid in W now?|pg||
nt|richie: that's sad for them, two bad boards in a row doesn't give much confidence|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  12 or 13...|pg||

nt|mrdct: but not a friendly layout in @d today|pg||
nt|spenny80: I bet 2@d|pg||
nt|richie: again unlucky breaks, but NS should be able to stop in 2@h/2NT here - south should just bid 1NT and deny 3@h with these good spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c drury|pg||
nt|zebutin: might be...which isnt too good for N... |pg||
nt|zebutin: 2nt maybe mixed raise?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|runnerup: can you bid 3nt that is the question here |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...well this is ok for EW, surely|pg||
nt|bebechira: lovely Sigrid did not want to penalize North|pg||
nt|richie: lol:)|pg||

nt|rodal f: What happend|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: Well I've seen a variant where it's @D + Major?  But standard unusual 2NT is @D + @H|pg||
nt|marionmi:  "small" accident happened on the last board|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3 more imps for Sweden and in the 18-12 teritory now|pg||
nt|richie: nearly 19-11   it shouldn't get any worse for the Dutch if they want to secure the silver medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Chicken - or?|pg||
nt|frankbo: da var de for høyt|pg||
nt|bebechira: E in 5h at the moment|pg||

nt|spenny80: aggressive bid|pg||

nt|kemperg: 4@D now|pg||

nt|richie: what to lead in east? passive diamond = OK|pg||
nt|richie: yes|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So this is a good 3Nt|pg||

nt|richie: Magdalena has to switch to a @d to set the contract (at least not spade)|pg||
nt|bebechira: i just typed ...diamond 2 now|pg||
nt|richie: 3@h is a challenge - you will have to take @d in north and play a club towars KT9 and allow east to keep it when she puts her figure|pg||
nt|richie: only way to discard your loosing @s|pg||
nt|richie: some alternative (playing low @H first or 2x@d) is possible|pg||
nt|bebechira: North in 4h in the open room...|pg||
nt|rensph: Operator, could you check result for board 12 after play?|pg||

nt|richie: 4@h can only be made by gods, let's see if she is one :)|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  4@h on S hand in open room with a spade lead|pg||

nt|bebechira: Rosaline club queen lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will try to ruff one @s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: still, might try @Hs instead of @Cs|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  3 more imps to Ned on board 11|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  I don't know how anyone could stay OUT of 4@S|pg||
nt|zebutin: i could come up many sequences where people could stay out... void @H vs. Kxxxx in hearts isn't exactly best...|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  yes, and game still makes...so maybe they all those people shouldnt worry so much|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  One more round to-day|pg||
nt|murat e: 520 beats this one if any...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You might see the lead in board 14 this way: Chance for more than 1 trick = @C-lead|pg||
nt|oosb: North should not have passed.|pg||
nt|oosb: Stuck for a bid I wouldve chosen 3@C|pg||
nt|oosb: Or dbl.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  with everything behaving, should make 5@h|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman needs to find the @s lead|pg||

nt|eliran_a: suprise|pg||
nt|runnerup: i am not aware about this system ,but 4 @h may indicate @c and try..ok -now has to guess @h|pg||
nt|eliran_a: action now , birman should not raise with the h!k when N plays @H from hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: if decl..doent guess @h -he is off because no squeze exist|pg||
pc|hA|nt|timve:  well defended|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@H was a good call, making EW to guess|pg||
nt|spenny80: you need 6@c and @s finess to make 3NT.... a lot|pg||
nt|richie: y|pg||
nt|richie: but gave 2 tricks back at once again by playing @H to T|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: nice duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: my P and i would bid 1@S X 2@H (sound 2@S) 3@H shortsuit trial 3@S and stay out :(|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, it makes in this hand.... :) but does it make most of the time with those sequences or not...thats the more important question, not what happens just this time :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  If my partner said "Sound 2@S" on that I would probably bid 4 anyway as Norht & shoot him later for underbidding|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kemperg: AK good in most cases|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loe48: hvis N stikker med honoer dra J neste gang for a tippe K10 eller Q10 bak|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: @D queen doesn't give declarer anything that isn't his already|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  my thought to|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: except the info that south had to lead from Qxx which means he didn't have anything more attractive|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so there is a clue about the hearts then|pg||
nt|eliran_a: game over|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: after 3@H there is  no way to find out|pg||

nt|zebutin: and blame him for bidding "Sound 2@S" if it doesn't make? :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: she will be able to establish a long @d but the defence will surely find their @c before she does so|pg||
nt|spenny80: W can play a 4th round in @h... I hope no|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry red suits ..yes makes even then ..so opening lead was critical|pg||

nt|eliran_a: cave |pg||

nt|bebechira: in 13|pg||

nt|vincenzo1: wds (well done son .... lol !)|pg||
nt|eliran_a: and he cant thinks too much , should play immidiattley small|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bebechira: East is bringing 2 s home in the open room|pg||
nt|bebechira: so imps for the french girls|pg||
nt|richie: east should now be able to count that partner has @cA and play @cQ|pg||
nt|richie: declarer can now take her diamonds and endplay west|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes... lets see|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  That is a sound 3@S limit, so if it doesn't make I will just shrug|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: B11 NS i 6@H. Samme som her|pg||

pc|sT|nt|spenny80: and if in W bid 3Nt looks like show 4@s (otherwise you have bid 3NT before) |pg||
nt|mrdct: best to cut her losses now and cash out the @s suit - otherwise many down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|richie: it has been a long and mentally tiring tournament, it's difficult for the players to keep up with the good level and see these kinds of endplays|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|oosb: And as one of the kibz points out, South couldve dbled 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  so now he must duck a @s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  If S plays another @h|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|spenny80: wait...|pg||
nt|chick: playing for a doubleton @D honor and a defense mistake|pg||
nt|2hplus4: He could have played for doubleton the other way|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @D-ruff brings nothing here - defense needs the @S 9 also|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  should East double?|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: the vulnerabilty may mislead birman here|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  No way to the 11th trick here, I hink|pg||
nt|rodal f: Likevel var det en kontrakt de fleste ville vert i.|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  2@c like gazzilli|pg||
nt|rensph: off-shape X with little strength...|pg||
nt|zebutin: got @D to @H K and another they ruffed...so lost only 1 @D this time when opponents didn't take their tricks|pg||

nt|spenny80: 2@s 4+@d|pg||
nt|bebechira: 3imps are 3 imps... it is a gain :)|pg||
nt|richie: west has a small powerhouse, but in green no need to risk for a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d by E now?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Now N could bid 4@d|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and he did|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  Thats not easy to double|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: now birman should know 3@H was not junk so maybe 4@h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spenny80: It's a bors for NT, 2 or 3 is little difference|pg||
nt|josj: hoping all the tens will come in, Fabio?|pg||
nt|spenny80: and with 3 10 i prefer more 3nt|pg||
nt|richie: normal 4h but no chance after the excellent diamond lead|pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
nt|richie: 3@cX = I want to lead this suit|pg||
nt|bebechira: comfortable level here |pg||
nt|richie: funny thing is that every VP has double the value|pg||
nt|eliran_a: good 5@h by dror|pg||
pc|s3|nt|asig: But may be hard to find|pg||
nt|loe48: ja, systemet er ikke saa godt at de faar vist trumf 10|pg||
nt|loe48: som ville vaert et noekkelkort her|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west has opened only 1 club, perhaps because of his spade holding...|pg||
nt|josj: but I agree in a way: 2nt makes no sense here...|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2nt relay|pg||
nt|bebechira: french girls in 2s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. Right end.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  W has shown 17 + and with E 2@d is FG|pg||
pc|s6|nt|asig: Well, QED|pg||
nt|runnerup: should make also inspite off 4-1 distibution -10 nicely sing -but carefull you must be|pg||
nt|bebechira: chance for the dutch girls to grab the lead|pg||
nt|richie: how? :)|pg||
nt|richie: easy board|pg||
nt|marionmi:  pretty risky 3@s bid by north :)|pg||
nt|marionmi:  nice lead, still Ticha will make at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Häxan in Sweden I think|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|runnerup: they pass that suit wholy |pg||
nt|asig: In a natural system also difficult: 1@c - 1@d, 2@h - ???|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c 5/4|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c any GF?|pg||
nt|spenny80: maybe, but after 2@h yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: so with this relay structure they will probably work out that they are missing the @c suit and settle in 5@d by default|pg||
nt|mrdct: although they might consider 4@s|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2h 1d and 1c ...|pg||
nt|bebechira: can not do anything about it|pg||
nt|richie: VERY comfortable!!|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|richie: but after this good lead, you may need it|pg||
nt|runnerup: needs @s lead fo -2|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like +100 for N-S as they can make 5@c|pg||
nt|eliran_a: birman is thinking maybe to correct it to 5@s |pg||
nt|eliran_a: in 5@h both @d and @s lead from N are 2 down for +300|pg||
nt|bebechira: 8 more imps for Italia on brd 13|pg||
nt|runnerup: -1 seems normal because @s lead is too difficult to find|pg||
nt|bebechira: Alon still there...ar is he getting water|pg||
nt|runnerup: for those who thinks @d lead is ok -north playes small first round and -1|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 1 @D loser away on @CJ :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes...but could only ruff 1 out of 2 @D left...so needed to get that @H too... :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gronkvist:  yes |pg||
nt|zebutin: cards sittign nicely for declarer here, so this makes a good break for coffee again|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ntmon: same start as in OR|pg||
nt|spenny80: you have not indication, have you?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: many flat boards though...|pg||

nt|andyv:  @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Häxan = the witch|pg||
nt|atalok: kaza olmazsa 3 içeri olacak.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@C 3@S 2@D and a@H faily lucky 3NT |pg||
pc|h7|nt|dagold: Israel playing in 1@c on 14 after east didn't respond|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@s it is|pg||
nt|richie: french will grab extend their lead|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But they played not the normal one. 2@c is either any strong or 14-16 w 6+@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 7 tricks and has to decide between @s and @d were the 8th and 9th are coming from|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  2@s in open room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see a route to nine tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|loe48: helt grei 4s. med muligheter|pg||
nt|mrdct: runs into similar problems to 5@d but at least you only need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|richie: revoke 4 clubs?|pg||
nt|bebechira: loool|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly|pg||
pc|c4|nt|spenny80: I agree with 4@s|pg||
nt|spenny80: not lucky|pg||
nt|mrdct: holding natural trumps tricks, not a good idea to lead a shortage|pg||

nt|yuval10: a hugh 20 imps swing|pg||

nt|bebechira: Nab in 1nt in the open room|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sweden in top |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes some imagination to get to 4@S|pg||

pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: west's double may show 3 spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: or a transfer to 1NT first, then diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  N dbl now?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  and now weak |pg||
nt|mancio89:  I don't, but for sure they did not pick the better contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  Not what North thought, anyway|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, usually bad to play in 5-2 AJ9xx vs. Qx if you have 6-2 K10 vs. AQJxxx on side...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: this seems a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|josj: you read my mind :)|pg||
nt|spenny80: not good for EW|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about 3 when looking at @CK|pg||
nt|chick: I definitely don't like the 3@H bid, it suggests a void in diamonds and a 4-3 fit in hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  We saw it come...|pg||
nt|frankbo: they did lead H against 6sp so easy to make|pg||
nt|marionmi:  note that west also started with a quiet pass over 3@d there, hoping for a misunderstanding |pg||

nt|richie: thank you all: especially operator, Traian, kibs for their comments|pg||
nt|bebechira: the match between Poland and Netherlands will be the decisive one|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S 10 dropping so seems like 2 aces + @S trick for defence|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: N was on lead in CR...low @D etc.|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT by W is much better|pg||
nt|rensph: 4-1 trump split may give declarer some headaches by south's spots aren't a real threat.|pg||

nt|rensph: Declarer may choose to finesse in spades now, before giving up a heart trick. There's a danger of being shortened in trumps otherwise.|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3H is fine by me. Max room for exploration and if partner wants to play in D you have a good card|pg||

nt|andyv:  s has easy 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some would prefer a 1@S overcall when that suit is so much better than the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: aye they play well now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well not exaclty sure what the 2 spades was, but EW together here|pg||
nt|andyv:  W's partner just happy to be out of the loop|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  now S must duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  this lead may require S to duck the 1st @s|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  In the open room Swe takes the first @s|pg||
nt|atalok: çimdi belki yapar|pg||
nt|atalok: þimdi|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So now Ita back on 2:nd place|pg||
mb|p|nt|loe48: he considering 7d|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: how the tides turn|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  good bye Padon|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks normal here also even thought ew has chances in 3 @h ,but no strenght|pg||
nt|eliran_a: looks like contract can go down by A@c switch now|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  my bet is Fisher will duck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How does it help to duck?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  mine to|pg||
nt|andyv:  he ducked earlier with Kxx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: If he ducks the defence has 3 spade and 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|rensph: defense shouldn't let declarer score any of his small trumps.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: N doing quite much bidding with his hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gronkvist:  But S must atl bid 5@s|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north can be weak so I agree with south's pass|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: not sure I agree with north's X, though|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: he has more than he promised|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 5th @S, 5-5 generally good shape, even @D king might be a trick if partner has xx|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I'm not sure that s has shown any @s support|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe 4@C was not a @S fit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree he told his story with 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  S can get 2@d tricks before giving up the 2nd @d trick to defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you play the hand if East switches to a club?|pg||
nt|rensph: we're taught to lead trumps against doubled partscores, as specs point out. No different here.|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|loe48: 5d makes it more difficult|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  so  what was 1@h?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 1@h was spades|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  new equation now:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It makes now, but club switch would have been killing|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs 3@d tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, @c switch probably dooms the contract|pg||
nt|runnerup: looked too difficult and was - that ruff system in clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|mancio89:  still 3@S can make|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't get to dummy to finesse @D|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  U dont want play defence in this vul with S hand|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: north didn't promise a lot of values, 5 level could be dangerous|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dan_ehh: didn't promise 5 cards either (I think)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  how|pg||
pc|sK|nt|zebutin: without @S ruff defence might have gotten trump promotion|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mancio89:  now, i wondered if he could endplay west|pg||
nt|zebutin: overruff that is|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|mancio89:  but no|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  nice defence here with a new @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: still trump promotion|pg||
nt|zebutin: usually better not to overruff with your sure trump trick...just let declarer keep it and see what developes|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, but now on the other hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|runnerup: the easyes way to find that side is to put bridge finland to google ..and you cant miss that side|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @c hook needs to be on|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  And he has kept them both (like good players should do) in this occasion.|pg||

nt|zebutin: Italy making raise on the scoreboard towards the end|pg||

nt|bobholl: without overruff also 2 down i think|pg||

mb|3S|nt|2hplus4: NS bidding seems strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: as a spec points out, had the other table reached 6NT on the last board the extra undertrick would've cost 7 imps. They'll be happy to hear they stopped in 3.|pg||

nt|gronkvist:  S dbl 3 @h ?|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|andyv:  wow, our first 1 level contract...players must be tired.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  1 Nt open also but E misgused @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|2hplus4: That was costly|pg||
nt|mancio89:  mmm it was north thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph: 4@H looks like one loser in each suit, provided you get the trumps right|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: likely another pickup for israel|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  otherwise you cant double on S hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  I can't believe he didn't think about that before|pg||
