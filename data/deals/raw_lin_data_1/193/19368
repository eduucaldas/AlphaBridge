nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Hi all -- will get the names in shorttly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good luck Ross|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|joest: North has a typical problem, which I usually solve by just raising to 2@c|pg||
nt|joest: yes partner might have only 3 but other calls distort.  Plus raising comes in handy if partner can compete to the three level with four or five clubs|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: some would try negative double and hope to survive.  I used to do that but gave it up|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hey kit|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play that a double (or 1@S) covers 4 or 5 spades, you can use the remaining action as take-out for the minors, but that is not standard.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kit: it is becoming a more popular treatment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Since South had not promised four clubs with his opening bid, he feels entitled to compete one level higher.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: I don't see bidding 3@H with 4-3-3-3, 4 clubs, 3 hearts on this auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can expect his partner to be very short in clubs and hopes that his 9 points will be enough 3@H, despite holding only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: both 3@C and 3@H need to make to show a real profit, and that just isn't likely|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: He cannot expect his side to hold 9 hearts between them, or West would have doubtless bid 3@H himself, following the Law of Total Tricks.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: and with a stiff club West might have bid 3@H anyway with offensive orientation|pg||
nt|kit: and not surprisingly, it is likely that both contracts will go down 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fans of the Law of Total Tricks will smile tolerantly and say 'What did they expect?'|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd pretty much has to hope South has ace-doubleton of hearts to even have a chance|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention that the ace of spades is on side|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|kit: South is "marked" with ace of hearts, since North is assumed to have ace of spades|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|h5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: he is playing along dummy reversal lines -- perhaps planning on ruffing another club, hoping diamonds 3-3, and then end-playing opponents -- very sensible |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C did indeed go one off at the other table, as can see (top left), so this third heart by East was not a wise investment. Fortunately, the stakes are low.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: He will now try to cash 2 diamonds, but unfortunately it won't work|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: if south were 4-2-3-4 originally Boyd might have made this.  I'm not sure I understand this line|pg||
nt|kit: so Robinson fought the law, and the law won|pg||
nt|joest: The Bobby Fuller Four|pg||

nt|daman: Hi William|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|granguru: @D3 asking for continuation|pg||
nt|athene: the main use for a support double is differentiating between 3- and 4-card support when partner might have only a 4-card suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: no need after an overcall which is (assumed to be :) ) at least 5 :)|pg||
nt|granguru: not with them|pg||
nt|granguru: they may enter with 4 good ones|pg||
nt|athene: sure, but they treat it as 5|pg||
nt|daman: support doubles are not played over overcalls|pg||
nt|granguru: so it is a good tool in such cases|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|granguru: I do|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: well it may or may not be a good tool after overcalls but it's definitely not standard|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|daman: definitely not|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s6|nt|daman: if he picks up the trumps he is home|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: if you play "overcall structure" where 1-level overcalls are often weak four-card suits, then yes, you might want it|pg||

nt|brolucius: Add 4 more IMPs to the Total Tricks scales.|pg||
nt|joest: teh 14-16 NT range prevented north from getting his spade suit in|pg||
nt|joest: at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: i guess that is 15 after all|pg||
nt|joest: but just barely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: It always takes a hand or two for the VGOP to warm up.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: big swing on opening lead at other table|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: After the Stayman auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3NT, you should favor a major-suit lead. Do not worry that responder holds a major; worry instead that the opener does not and will be ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well-stocked in the minor suits.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|joest: the jack of hearts looks fairly normal|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson-Boyd play puppet -- this will hurt them, since West will show 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|kit: now double of 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: which will warn them, so they can survive in 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a chance to double.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, invite or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson considering.  Becker doubled 2@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: assuming North doubles, the key will be whether Robinson-Boyd have the understandings to determine they have no spade stopper|pg||
nt|joest: there are other variations of Puppet that avoid this risk but this is the 'original' version.|pg||
nt|joest: Kit, did you invent this or am I imagining things?|pg||
nt|kit: didn't invent it, but I did publicize it|pg||
nt|joest: so now the trick is to get to 5@c and keep the loss to a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson's pass denies a spade stopper -- or at least, it should|pg||
nt|joest: Your name is attached to it in my mind :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|joest: now at this point what all is forcing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kit: this redouble is just a repeat --|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was no doubt thinking of bidding 3@C on the previous round, but he can bid it now.|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like they will survive and get to 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were lucky that Pettis did not have a natural spade lead|pg||
nt|kit: Nicely done -- unlucky to still lose 3 imps on it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: I don't mind opening 1NT on East's shape, but it was a bit of a stretch with Q-J doubleton and such a relatively poor 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|joest: so this looks like three more to Spector|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd-Robinson were unlucky here that the auction let North double 2@S.  More normally Puppet has the advantage of concealing declarer's distribution.|pg||
nt|kit: 1NT might not be ideal, but that alternatives are really awful|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to open 1@C and rebid 1NT, shaving off a point.|pg||

nt|daman: responder. This generally occurs in a competitive auction, in which an opponent interferes at a low level.|pg||
mb|1N|an|14 - 16|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even many expert "standard" bidders would treat that east hand as a 1nt opener |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even more so when you can't open 1@C naturally|pg||
nt|daman: this will be down to dismal defeat if a @S is led|pg||
nt|athene: it would be awkward to show it whether you started with 1@C or 1@D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|granguru: sorry  but support doubles were devised by Dr. George Rosenkrantz before Rodwell was a competitive player|pg||

nt|athene: ah, sorry, he has nine even with only two clubs|pg||

nt|kit: which doesn't happen often these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Indeed. That's a plus for 1NT in that you might shut out the majors.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|joest: of course you know Meckwell be opening 1NT at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Transfer auction will get to routine 4@S -- key will be how the trump suit is handled.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest: possible to land in 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would play OK with the @CQ on lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South made the "losing" club lead -- but it was a winner, since it put declarer in dummy for the losing trump to the king play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever!|pg||
nt|joest: same thing could easily happen here|pg||
nt|kit: sure could -- but on heart lead, contract will likely make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Now, with no convenient entry to dummy, Robinson will likely lead a low spade from his hand, successfully|pg||
nt|brolucius: What opening lead style is that - 3rd best from four-low?|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, if he plays jack of hearts and Becker ducks !!!!!|pg||
nt|joest: not in this world :)|pg||
nt|kit: normal style here -- count over attitude|pg||
nt|brolucius: North does not know that South hasn't the @HQ.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|joest: north south would seem destined for 3NT here|pg||
nt|kit: might not be so simple with East being 6-5|pg||

nt|joest: fair enough|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: But the void spade is no bonus. I don't expect E/W to bid high (but I have been wrong in the past).|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S!|nt|kit: 2@S shows presumably 5 spades and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Just to let everyone know.  When I vugraph the auction, I am at least a half a|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: round behind.  -- security reasons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spector will have plenty of system available to him now.|pg||
nt|kit: If South doublles, Boyd will bid 2NT asking for minor|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2N!|nt|kit: Robinson now knows that Boyd is short in spades, so he will lead a diamond vs. 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: over 3@d I guess Spector is kind of endplayed into bidding 3@s|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: This is part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT. Steve says it's named Robinson when it works, Woolsey when it fails|pg||
nt|joest: or could just make a presumably forcing pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double was for take-out, so North would probably not double 2NT with four hearts. |pg||
nt|kit: Not clear what Spector should do -- he may pass it around|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Spector is the one taking his time.|pg||
nt|kit: And then Becker would probably bid 3NT -- don't know how many tricks diamonds would take -- I'd guess 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly.|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd doesn't have any reason to know Robinson has a 5-card diamond suit, so he will be finished bidding|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't have any reason to expect 4-card support, so he will also be finished bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|kit: The expected diamond lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is obviously entitled to bid 3NT, even if there was an agreed slow pass. His partner has already shown game-try values and he has the opponent's suits wekk stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: slow pass means nothing here -- the double puts N-S in a force|pg||
nt|brolucius: It showed a maximum then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: becker: "My double was forcing."|pg||
nt|kit: Given time declarer could set up 9 tricks -- 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 3 spades -- but he won't be given that time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: (Boyd asked)|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that case I am surprised that South did not bid 3@S, to show that he has that suit well stopped.|pg||
nt|kit: they know to not be worried about spades from Boyd's 2NT call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strange reason not to give partner the information directly!|pg||
nt|kit: Spector was willing to defend 3@D doubled if Becker doubled it -- that's the reason for the pass|pg||
nt|joest: this is a complex hand to say the least|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: probably spade to jack and club off looks like most logical line|pg||
nt|joest: a direct route to 9 tricks if west has Kx(x) of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may require that East can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s6|nt|kit: West can win fourth diamond if necessary|pg||

nt|joest: a lot would depend on what west pitched on the spade jack too|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|granguru: not many play Rubensohl as it is not a simmetric convention..many irregularities make it easy to forget or make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: declarer wants to come to two diamonds, three spades, two hearts and two clubs, but the problem is the defenders might get the diamonds set up before that|pg||
nt|athene: i think he might need some sort of strip-squeeze on east in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: if he just plods away boringly, the defence get in twice (@CK, @HK) and set up three diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: table taking a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trivia question:  of the 8 players now on vugraph, how many have never been 1st or 2nd in this event?|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes the key to the defence in these positions is for the defender under pressure (Meckstroth here) to reach his partner's hand using the spot cards in their common suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Boyd must keep both minors|pg||
nt|kit: Rather amusing that the 6-0 heart split destroyed 3NT, since defense knew not to duck a heart -- but 4@H contract survived it|pg||
nt|joest: I know that 2NT then 3NT is often correctable. Not sure about this one although, as Kit says, Spector can work out that hearts may be the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know if 3@H showed a good suit or just a minimum?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Becker must have realised that he was in the wrong game, when dummy went down with such good hearts. The 6-0 break would then give him a flicker of hope that 4@H might go down.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: The point if that if partner doesn't have Ax of hearts 3NT can be very wrong, while 4@H can't be too wrong|pg||

nt|kit: Sometimes it just doesn't pay to be too clever|pg||
nt|brolucius: no-trump probe..|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: detractor of 5@H is that it directs defense to find @D  when honors are split|pg||
pc|cA|nt|granguru: a strategic bid 1. to see if there is a double fit 2. to give a potential lead 3. to give partner a ruff if singleton in the suit |pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't , even when West passes over 1@S. That is in accordance with the Bridge Magazine panel system. Constructive but non-forcing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How else would you bid a forcing 2@H? Jump to 3 when you only want it to be a one-round force?|pg||
nt|kit: jump to 3@H, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Robinson into to the deep end of the think tank....|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H game force|pg||

nt|joest: I think Brian SEnior devoted a chapter to it in his book "The Transfer Principle"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Jeff Rubens wrote about them in the Bridge World, April 1981|pg||

nt|joest: wow " a while back" = 30 years.  I should have known.  :(|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW play  RM Precision   RM=Rodwell Meckstroth, but most call it Meckwell|pg||
nt|veistikke:  how old are these players? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: It may just have occurred to Rodwell that this was the first 1@c opening, because he made certain that he had alerted Pettis it was strong :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D!|an|NAT, FG, 8+|nt|athene: most call them meckwell because "rodstroth" sounds like a villain in Star Wars|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yesterday the Semi-Final Match had TWO RM Precision pairs competing   Walter Johnson [bigtrain] and Doug Simson [dougs] play the full system with only a couple of tweaks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Meckwell were 'forced' into it after a strong club and Rodwell showed 5-7 with support|pg||
pc|s8|nt|joest: Surprise!  Meckwell reached 4@s in the closed room|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think most players would raise the spades on that. Except strict followers of the Ron Klinger Losing Trick Count.|pg||
nt|kit: my rule is:  no aces + no kings + no singletons + no voids = no bid|pg||
nt|joest: = no fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East held a doubleton club, the game would be OK.|pg||
nt|joest: defense would have to seriously awry to let this in|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Suppose you pass and West re-opens with a double. You might be worried bidding just 2@S then, with 6 points (albeit ropey ones) and 3-card support.  I prefer to bid straight away ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with a weak hand and then fold up my cards (ahem).|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT would likely have had a better chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with @DJ onside|pg||
nt|kit: King of clubs shift allows this to make|pg||
nt|kit: so does ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: either a passive heart or underleading the diamond needed|pg||
nt|joest: definitely not easy|pg||
nt|kit: heart exit is okay I think|pg||
nt|kit: and of course low diamond is most successful|pg||
nt|brolucius: @CK certainly looks attractive, though. He will do well to avoid it.|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room south got a diamond raise in (from where?) but here no bidding from south|pg||
nt|kit: Becker would have been better off leading king of clubs on opening lead this time -- of course, on a different day that could cost the contract|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: on  13  the other room also  3N West|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: but hard for meckstroth to offer 3nt AND show the spade support|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what he was trying to do with the forcing 3@S bid - i.e. if rodwell could find a 3nt bid he would pass with great happiness|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that meckstroth could have bid 3nt over 2@S to show this hand - well, yes, if 3nt shows that hand exactly, he definitely should have bid it :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Ace of diamonds and four trumps, or @SQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|kit: RKC and queen ask will locate missing queen of spades, so they can still stop that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1@S looks right.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kit: he needs ace of diamonds not ace of hearts for it to be good, unless partner also holds king of clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: but partner didn't cue the ace of diamonds.  He probably couldn't cue the ace of hearts b/c 4@h would be natural|pg||
nt|kit: He has to like the double -- no diamond problem now -- so he knows it is at worst on spade split|pg||
nt|brolucius: North opened 2@C at the other table, I am told.|pg||

nt|athene: my guess is, the play consisted of north asking whether trumps qere 2-2|pg||
nt|athene: and EW looking disgruntled|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|ahollan1: and they qere|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that Bill|pg||
nt|athene: (actually they never look disgruntled but they would have told him trumps were indeed 2-2)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Actually, no one looked disgruntled :)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5+ !ds, FG|mb|p|mb|2N|an|F, BAL or short !ds|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force, 5+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=balanced   go figure|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT shows a balanced hand :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh right, could be 4414|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N denies 4-card major   so they've done good job of hiding Rodwell's hand|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead will take a nice entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 2N balanced or short @ds|pg||
nt|athene: @H10 lead and south can still shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1N-2@C[Puppet Stayman]//2@D-3N|pg||
nt|athene: club lead is very bad|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|athene: ok, Landen did his part - should not be hard for Pettis|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Becker led @C5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another great defense from Landen-Pettis|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it was at all obvious to lead the heart there, so well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm still trying to work thru  @C vs @S shift at trick 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: maybe there's an endplay without @C shift|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: ok, gib says this is still makeable - you can steal a diamond trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S sure seemed right|pg||
nt|athene: and then i suppose  N gets endplayed in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right     @C shift then @S  is 100% beat|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though he needs to get endplayed TWICE, though?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you have to endplay each defender in turn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  i barely found that looking at all hands   how was Pettis supposed to do it single dummy?|pg||
nt|athene: duck a spade, throw north in with the heart, then strip squeeze south in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if rodwell does all that, he will be entitled to extra anchovies on his pizza during the break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The break will be short, roughly 10 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is that enough time for a pizza?|pg||
nt|athene: duck a spade probably can't hurt, can it? whatever you are choosing to do later|pg||
nt|chick: Probably not, just give him the anchovies :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rod stil doesn't know who holds @DK   only that Landen didn't start with @DKx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: north could still have started with @DKxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure he's working thru permutation of Landen @Dxx  Pettis @DKxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it seems duck @S - @D from North seems to kill many chances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe @HQ @H  is same problem|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that on a spade duck, south can shift to a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Rodwell asked about Smith, they play standard Smith. Now he's studying things|pg||
nt|athene: that is true, but declarer just ducks|pg||
nt|athene: then he wins the heart return|pg||
nt|athene: cashes the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: and throws north in to lead into the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: and south gets squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so     how does Rod process Pettis' failure to shift to @C??|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think this is a tough game|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|athene: darn :( ok well it was maybe just asking too much|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: just 1 hand away from being positive that it is tough game|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you can read much into the spade (as opposed to club) at trick 2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|nt|athene: south was always leading a spade there given the dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: so DC will have 4 pickups this set -- ALL double-digit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||
mc|7|nt|ahollan1: btw - if you look at the Bracket -- the numbers in parentheses indicate the team's ACBL District |pg||
