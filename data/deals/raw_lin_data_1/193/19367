nt|yorkbeach:  trying to work out which of 2@s and 2@d are clearly forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  scope for an accident here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i like ten clear 2NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S sounds natural to me...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but as NS were trying to play in @s, East should work it out|pg||
nt|josj: E can see it, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at another vulnerability, E might think NS have psyched|pg||

nt|roswolf: it makes -therefore as a keen supporter of roland - a great slam|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt byN is best as it avoids opening ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C is much better than a roland slam (35% for @C 22 wihout !JQ sec and 10% for 31 with honour sec) so 45% or so|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|josj: blank honour works either way provided you guess correctly which way :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this might be bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|roswolf: both pards showing shortages - great news|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: I hope they know what they are doing|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: so S thought they had a @S fit and thus they ended up in the best contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: luck plays its part|pg||
nt|josj: board still to be played in CR|pg||
nt|josj: this may well win the match for the Bandung Blues|pg||

mb|3C|nt|007 joosth: weak hearts but  54|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 6NT requires @C split and to be played by N|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ntmon: worse than 6@H on  32|pg||
nt|ntmon: OR bidding to 6NT looks suspicious (unconvincing) to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|007 joosth: lots oftricks possible     T  even|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ntmon: NT contract better by N, 6@C hinges on @C suit, with slight possibility of @D ruff|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bagman: Typically when opponents have bid two suits and agree on the third, it's good to lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|ntmon: 5@C theoretically right but losing the swing and losing also the match!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|josj: yes, 16-14 VP now to the Bandung Blues, which will do neither team any good|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bagman: It might also go down if N holds up the ace of hearts and either gives a heart ruff or removes dummys last trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ntmon:  29 seems to be mis-scored somehow|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|bagman: Declarer needs to do some guessing the contract can be made but there are multiple threats in the major suits|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: a perfect fit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|josj: 2@H is a bit of an underbid, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 2@H was imaginative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: sry N bid 2@H...that eluded me :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south bids he might regret it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: passing out opps in game is rarely wrong unless you are prepared to sac over a slam bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: in a slam e/w would have an interesting trump view which may have been got wrong|pg||
nt|josj: he has the same view now, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|josj: but it's rather irrelevant :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: the overcaller is typically short in the trump suit|pg||
nt|josj: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|josj: that's why S should have bid on|pg||
nt|josj: driving the opps to slam for +100|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|josj: the double helped declarer in OR to play against the a priori odds in the trump suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 6@H basically on @H 2-2 or dropping singleton !QH |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|josj: 3@D is a medium @S raise|pg||
nt|ntmon: @HQ|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ntmon: OR where W did not open, had not any chance to get to slam|pg||
