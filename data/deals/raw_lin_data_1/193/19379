nt|dburn: but repeated clubs should also work|pg||

mb|2H|nt|henryb:  Board 45 was played in 4@s making 5, so either there was a director ruling to change the score or a mistake in the entry|pg||

nt|jtr: Board 8 went down at the other table in a rather novel way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With its racecourse, harbour, international film festival, marinas, conference centre, villas, Grand Casino and sumptuous hotels, Deauville is regarded as the "Queen of the Norman ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: beaches" and one of the most prestigious seaside resorts in all of France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a bit pricey needless to say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 154 euros per night is definitely steep, do they have pensions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't afford to pronounce the name of the resort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: It's Casino Barrière|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember how I paid 6 euros for a bottle of coke, 20 cl. It was a posh restaurant admittedly, but still|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meaning there is a barrier to you winning|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the wine was 2 euros a jug|pg||

nt|fabsayc: is that an adjacent town|pg||

nt|jtr: I remember Jeremy Flint sending back a wine 3 times at the Hotel du Golf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder at that price|pg||

nt|jtr: that was 30 years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I never did|pg||
nt|jtr: Never did taste?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Taste yes, once, never since|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's against my religion to touch alcohol, also to drink it|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he was not on the sommelier's Xmas card list|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He must have found a cheap place|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no wonder all scandinavians can be found in the baltic republics|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is there a ferry from le havre to deauville|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are a bunch of idiots, watching a blank screen for 15 minutes|pg||
nt|jtr: Probably to Trouville  They would not allow those things in Deauville|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well is a long way around the bay, would make sense|pg||
