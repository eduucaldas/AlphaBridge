mb|2H|nt|henryb:  Board 45 was played in 4@s making 5, so either there was a director ruling to change the score or a mistake in the entry|pg||

nt|jtr: Board 8 went down at the other table in a rather novel way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With its racecourse, harbour, international film festival, marinas, conference centre, villas, Grand Casino and sumptuous hotels, Deauville is regarded as the "Queen of the Norman ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: beaches" and one of the most prestigious seaside resorts in all of France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a bit pricey needless to say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not bad|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 154 euros per night is definitely steep, do they have pensions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't afford to pronounce the name of the resort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: It's Casino Barriรจre|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember how I paid 6 euros for a bottle of coke, 20 cl. It was a posh restaurant admittedly, but still|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meaning there is a barrier to you winning|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the wine was 2 euros a jug|pg||

nt|jtr: Never did taste?|pg||
