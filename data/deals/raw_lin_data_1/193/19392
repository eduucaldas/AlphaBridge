nt|vugrapha4: Deal 1 now starting - players sorting cards....|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: we start with a partscore no blood here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you play a mini NT of course, say 10-12|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :) |pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: and "right siding"  4 @H with transfer |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kemperg: what happened with the score of the first session?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: good valuation West|pg||

nt|cascade: luckily everything behaves and 3NT will survive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mundell, sry|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: and Ian|pg||

nt|sybarra: do we have site with standings? |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I'll try my best to keep up with the players :)|pg||

nt|mamos: EW play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have the N-S convention card in front of me|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  good luck:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: we are playing 2 sets tonight and the rest og 4 tomorrow|pg||
nt|bebechira: tomorrow we will have Youth final as well.... 4 sets of 10 brds|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good hope I am there and also see Cathy in finals |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  will EW find their @d game or 3NT|pg||
nt|cascade: might be hard for north to only invite here|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s hands fit well |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Unfortunately NSW didn't do so well with youth..|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cascade: and then the defense need to establish their heart trick before declarer can build a club trick to beat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which did not happen next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is a Bergen raise, limit|pg||
nt|cascade: five card support, two aces, two doubletons and vulnerable at IMPs i think i would be bidding game!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand a tad too good for that in my view|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  3@h may show min. with @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 6@s a likely make, how good is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: hard to imagine south accepting her hand is as bad as it could be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that Wood should sign off opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: next year Cathy!! |pg||
mb|3H|nt|cascade: some players make a limit bid then bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But Touyz changed her mind|pg||
nt|cascade: as Touyz has done here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: need diamonds 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Viv may get a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other suits are not attractive to lead from|pg||
nt|mamos: i guess this must be two-suiter weak South is presumably jst raising |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike,  you happy with only 3?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: but maybe @s Kx in pocket|pg||
nt|haans: but all honors working|pg||
nt|mamos: but you dont have @s10 so probably not one you care about missing|pg||
nt|cascade: i feel if you choose to consult partner then you should stick with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would you lead, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: its true but trumps are not that attractive either|pg||
nt|sybarra: magic hand,  as the @D are 3/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that @H's are 3/1 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  I didn't think E had that option (to bid 4@s) but this should go down 2 (4@s and A@h), minimum|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|cascade: i like to attack but that is a guess here|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of tricks here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cascade: a trump will usually give declarer a tempo|pg||
nt|cascade: would you lead a trump Roland?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I know what went through Touyz's mind. "I am not good enough for a Jacoby 2NT, and I am too good for 4@S. So I'll make a limit raise then bid game later. That should convey ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the message". Just a guess|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  please correct|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8@s did not win the first trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  first spade trick that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  we may not be able to get a record of how the hand was played|pg||
nt|sybarra: little does she know |pg||
nt|mamos: may be if WA are already quite away behind there is a case for bidding  more|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Did South really play 4@S undoubled next door??|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lost, sorry|pg||
nt|santyclz: So WA plays 4@ss undoubled in both rooms...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: howcome 11?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't know what 2@h is here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strange when looking at four in the dummy|pg||
nt|cascade: and they didnt cash their diamond tricks |pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  perhaps it's weak with majors|pg||
nt|haans: my vote for 3@H|pg||
nt|cascade: EW need to stay low with their distributional hands |pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: did he dperhaps draw trump and conceded Diamond?|pg||
nt|cascade: this is potentially 800 i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know that Viv would like to double, but I also know that her partner expects 4-4 in the majors for that, so she will probably abstain|pg||
nt|sybarra: W with a lot of points  but where to land? |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 3 nt?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  W has an easy 3N bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, she did :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hands with voids are always difficult to evaluate when preempt openings|pg||
nt|bebechira: TD is Laurie Kelso...and he is trying to mantain a good "tempo" to all matches ...he is sometimes very strict with time at the club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: that not best surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry  was distracted by my grandchildren|pg||
nt|bebechira: he offered 80 mins for 10 boards... lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: i think 90 would have been more generous|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to speed it a bit |pg||
nt|bebechira: we had last week Albena..and they were more generous there|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be where W had thought she would play this bd if it goes all pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  the @s holding is such that EW do have a @s stopper|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now he doesn't know which suit to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level I think you should have 4-4 if you are this weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E should have little trouble getting 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wayne?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At the 2-level fine with me|pg||
nt|cascade: yes i would pass|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably we play with screens - 85 is the standard time for ten boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: we play with screens yes|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 80 is not very generous from Laurie|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cascade: partner needs a good hand to make anything|pg||
nt|cascade: and the odds favour her not having enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mercifully undoubled but it matters little as 3NT was made next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this could be a disaster |pg||
nt|bebechira: i think this IS a disster :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised no X but maybe didnt want to give hand away and afraid of another suit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo undo,  I bet there is a X |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry I missed the bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: but will claim at the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cathy,  no X?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The play will finish soon|pg||
nt|mamos: NS clearly on different pages of the manual|pg||
nt|mamos: South must think North has shown Spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Declarer won 1 trick so far|pg||
pc|cA|mc|8|nt|bebechira: ok Cathy back on track now :)|pg||
nt|mamos: was 4@S really the contract NS?  probably EW|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yeah, a little bit of post mortem now..|pg||
nt|bebechira: they will start 14 soon|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes sorry that's what happened|pg||

nt|cascade: hope NS have good agreements as to strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Take the money!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have 800 again this|pg||
nt|cascade: although wood is probably going to game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 1100 if declarer misguesses trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two top hearts, @SA, spade to king, spade ruff, @CK|pg||
nt|cascade: they have to get their spade ruff which might not be obvious with the stiff trump|pg||
nt|cascade: easy if you play obvious switch |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12 the other room was in 4 @H |pg||
mb|2C|nt|kemperg: yes|pg||

nt|bebechira: ok done now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  this will not do well|pg||
nt|haans: most play that fourth suit is GF|pg||
nt|sybarra: this one going -1,  but could be missing 6 |pg||
nt|mamos: exactly Shirley|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer will have to run 4@s tricks to avoid a total disaster|pg||
nt|cascade: @hA (or K) must be better |pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: 4@S cannot take 2 clubs ruffs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Declarer might still lose three spade tricks, mind|pg||
nt|cascade: in general it must be better to get a look at dummy on this sort of auction before committing the defense|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ianmcc: of course, sorry a likely make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 800 is a certainty|pg||
nt|cascade: she should get the spade right as south is marked now with at most two spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: I could raise to 3 @C (that is forcing after 2 @C for me) |pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  E should discard another @c|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: of course most people can't bid 2@C naturally as a passed hand|pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: Wood feared declarer had @HQ10 left and that she would get two spades away|pg||

nt|haans: -1 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First time for you I hear|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
nt|athene: well maybe 2@C WAS drury here :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and decided if you play drury or not |pg||
nt|mamos: im afraid thats a pretty awful sequence and outcome - any bid that precludes 4@h  must be wrong|pg||
nt|sybarra: but given the raise to 5 @C, ...not sure that looked/sounded like drury |pg||
nt|athene: it definitely wasn't drury for north :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: maybe for south though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Cathy is a member of the NSW youth team|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: We're not doing so well though....|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps but she should have had a count from north|pg||
nt|athene: north should have splintered with 3@S over 2@C|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kemperg: 2@D both majors|pg||
nt|mamos: gain to Wellington on the hand where 4@s went three off 4@h succeeded in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|andyv:  3@s (showing shortness) would be a nice gadget to have for W|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt would be interesting|pg||
nt|cascade: the WBF rate is nearly 90 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: spade or @CA lead would be costly|pg||
nt|mamos: looks  a fairly ordinary 4@h|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mamos: not my favourite opening method but works well here|pg||
nt|haans: Can 2@D be Ekrens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I strongly disagree with the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|cascade: passing 1@s with that much is really trusting partner at this vul :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No points and no room taken away from opps|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is clearly spades but i have seen people have misunderstandings over whether it's forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5-9 nine cards in Majors|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 6-10|pg||
nt|haans: bidding good Avoided slam though|pg||

nt|ianmcc: will be lucky to squeak 4@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: not easy to get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Germ trying to work out best line - may take some time|pg||
nt|athene: what is west supposed to do with, say that same hand but no @CK or @DAKQ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with E |pg||
mb|3N|nt|cascade: but a good suit and favourable vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this may fail |pg||

mb|4H|nt|sybarra: now the pull to 4 @H is slamish |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will not do well on @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may get to 6@H and that is easy to defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Viv Wood will lead her singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  if they go down, EW will have had back to back disasters|pg||
nt|kemperg: i'm not impressed by Wellington :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think east has slightly overstated her hand - 4H over 2@D was ok|pg||

mb|4C|nt|athene: if east wants to bid over 3@D then i prefer 3@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  EW already getting too high|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see S cards as prempts|pg||
nt|athene: tricky lead decision for south here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people often lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit and it usually costs|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand nothing is really appealing|pg||
nt|athene: that basically has to say "i have a 4@C raise but with an extra heart"|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: (yes seen it :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: seems slightly odd to bid 2@S   West is maximum (Precision) |pg||
nt|cascade: usually?|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have diamonds it's sort of good to emphasize hearts rather than clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely that 3 @H buys the pot |pg||
nt|athene: well, 3@H is as likely as 4@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  with a passed partner, there was little reason for W to bid again unless it's a system requirement in which case they may wish to modify some parts of their system.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, "very often" costs|pg||
nt|cascade: certainly if you have something better to do|pg||
nt|cascade: here south's alteratives were also unattractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let declarer fiddle around with the side suits|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i guess 4@C shuts out 3@S from south|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: 2@S usually show extra|pg||
nt|kemperg: and his distribution|pg||
nt|basu_4139: extra with shape too|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|cascade: how often are these trumps leads right Roland?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: @H position very favourable for EW|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I expect WA to gain an IMP here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West will lead @HJ against 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: no action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@c was slated for down 5|pg||
nt|kemperg: just took coffe|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or down 4 anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could produce 4@c tricks for NS|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cascade: not a trump?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: 2@H looks like transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is a case for leading a low heart rather than the jack|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  and it will|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: get contract in strong hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: east might as well play ace and another heart|pg||
nt|cascade: low still makes 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know|pg||
nt|athene: play her partner for @HKJ10x or a top spade|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  N unaware that 3N now is a laydown|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: looks like 9|pg||
nt|athene: with the @H9 in dummy you aren't getting a second heart - also your ace can be dropped anyway|pg||
nt|athene: or take the ace and shift to something|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so sorry, lost them again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you play a diamond at trick 2?|pg||
nt|cascade: trump was better |pg||
nt|Walddk2: She will hopefully make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cascade: yes there is a small danger and trumps will not be a problem|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|mamos: I play that 3NT from East there just denies the ability to support Spades so P can choose to pass 3NT if she has the right hand |pg||

nt|mamos: still nine tricks or even 10|pg||
nt|ianmcc: against this passive defence looking at that dummy|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
mc|11|nt|sybarra: high cross ruff |pg||
nt|athene: auctions after 3m - 3M are nasty because most of the time responder just wants to offer the major but play 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: but opener playing the notrumps is not usually best|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if 3 nt by W would have made sense |pg||
nt|athene: this auction was a bit weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: she might have gotten a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought 4@D would be forcing without specific agreement|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Fuller just called Director|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: They are outside talking|pg||
nt|athene: east surely could have tried 4@S over it anyway - she has a pretty good hand for spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If I bid, I prefer 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 3NT a chance|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt a bit more appealing than 4@H here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  quite an overbid but perhaps driven there by the vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South needed to bid 3NT  |pg||

mb|3S|nt|vugrapha4: 5 minutes remaining|pg||

nt|mamos: nope|pg||

nt|sybarra: etc|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|athene: not sure what the @D6 is supposed to be|pg||

nt|athene: surely west should either be playing a big diamond (8) or a little one (3)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: How to make only one heart trick on defence|pg||
nt|cascade: even with a double she wins as the normal lead results in -600 here|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mamos: East will be happy to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: best west declaring|pg||
nt|athene: the spades lie nicely for declarer and the @H10 will be valuable too, but still there is too much work to do, too many aces to knock out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  S loves to bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: well ?|pg||

nt|mamos: AS a frequent TD I'm sure players shouldnt get into time-trouble  but if you do you must take your punishment - and play properly  fines usually = one or two imps playing badly ...|pg||
nt|mamos: double figures|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  6@d only goes for 1100|pg||

nt|andyv:  operator, are we sure as to who is doing all the bidding?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: now if declarer leads the @SK, north should duck|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer gets only two spade tricks and only one entry to dummy |pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: so she can lead a club up only once and that is not enough|pg||

nt|andyv:  operator, need to undo auction all the way back to 3@c|pg||
