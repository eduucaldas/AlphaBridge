nt|riccho:  the czech bid a lousy 5@d instead of 3NT and should have lost 11 imps. and the italian defender revoked the declarer into a successful game. S should stand up and go to the toilet for 5 minutes.|pg||

nt|poohbear: Dbl by Schwartz aggressive opposite a passed partner. Would be better with xx in @ds and the AJ somewhere else. But now it has worked out fine|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 620/650 is on, so 500 is OK|pg||

nt|andy_h: Hi there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Jacka Ciechomskiego...po po³udniu polowanie na komentatorów jest bardziej wydajne:)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think West's signal is suit preference with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|poohbear: he can stand either shift so he gave a middle card|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As SouthÂ´s faher points out: 4 @D would have been a better bid - West might pick 4 @H then|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@d was hardly FG |pg||

nt|loe48: agreed, the values of the hand is lowered now by club bid, so an understandable pass|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But would East bid then - facing a passed partner?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Notice fisher won the @c king to induce partner to return a @H |pg||
nt|poohbear: and possibly fool declarer|pg||
nt|poohbear: I would pass the TO dbl of 4@d since I have my points in @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would most of us|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But even 4 !@D X might cost 500|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer trying to decide if he can afford to play King here|pg||
nt|poohbear: If the @d ace onside and tripleton then the @h ace rates to be in East and he can ruff 3@s in dummy|pg||

nt|panosk: 11 against 6 and 4@S have a play|pg||
nt|vugraphzjm: but if they the King becomes stiff|pg||
nt|mrdct: to make this, declarer may need to cash @SA and then work on @c|pg||

nt|mrdct: or cash @sA and then cross-ruff|pg||

nt|andy_h: assuming no club ruffs looming I think the best play is a small trump from W (dummy). Obviously North would have a hard time ducking with Kx so if North plays low you stick in the ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 9. That way it only loses against Kxx with North. By playing the Ace and low to Q you will lose x with North (2 cases)|pg||
nt|andy_h: (I was talking about the trump play on the previous board)|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D shows singleton @D..I guess|pg||

nt|bagman: with a trump lead there's no hope of ruffing a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S might not turn out well...|pg||
nt|eleni: The Greek youngsters here, as they understand they are behind, they overbid, which is sad|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: welcome William|pg||
nt|gmarco24: maybe -1 after good guess in first trick, let's see...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking was reasonable; even if west plays the nine you can still lead to the ten and try and make a club trick for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Grunke is still believing in this contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|runnerup: north passed -many would double so ew in 2 @s without opponents bid anything -.1nt was ..something|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||

nt|poohbear: sorry . I thought 9 card fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will just take @h finesse |pg||

nt|panja: S must have thought it was feature...so @H suit was likely to be open|pg||

nt|rensph: Might make 10 if you manage to ruff 2 hearts in dummy and set up the club trick, but defense might force in @D|pg||

nt|spenny80: I don't know|pg||
nt|spenny80: for italy a sort of 2/1 i think|pg||

nt|famus: with a @H cue might go a notch higher|pg||
nt|ady: meantime  e/w have bought the contract|pg||
nt|riccho:  modern approach is to bid 1NT even with subminimum hands. Goal is to silence the bidding for NS. |pg||
nt|riccho:  In this hand however it led only to an unsuccessful contract|pg||
nt|vasmar: previous board was a disaster for Italy|pg||
nt|friggi: meget venligt udspil|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bagman: with spades breaking and @HK onside the contract makes (there are some additional chances in case 2 of the three things are not working)|pg||

nt|andy_h: Back on the slam board I think declarer could have done better - could he have just ruffed the diamonds, cash 1 club and run the trumps to find out about the distribution? Seems ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: like the most likely diamond layout would be 6-5 and if South has 5-2-5-1 or 6-2-4-1 then it seems 4@D is a underbid|pg||
nt|runnerup: some possibilities to miss tricks in defence but very unlikely|pg||

pc|s3|nt|runnerup: spades and still 200 at least|pg||

nt|andy_h: 3@S is muse to South's ears, but given the club void which may not be a good thing (potentially partner's main suit) Rimstedt's red suits are quite dangerous|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  a non-serious cue perhaps|pg||
nt|spenny80: 2@s is good raise|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s can be beaten,but can be difficult also ..@d looks grouing -after missdefende or endplay in clubs possible|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 4@h is ok, 5@c is not good save|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wishes he had raised clubs earlier in life|pg||
nt|athene: now he has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, NS may have only 16 hcp combined but they are boss of this deal|pg||

nt|riccho:  filigrane|pg||
nt|loe48: ta i bordet og spill ruter|pg||
pc|c9|nt|desinka: now|pg||
nt|famus: a raise and then a straight forward RKC|pg||
nt|andy_h: If 4@D was a cue-bid then it appears that N/S do not favour cue-bidding shortages in partner's primary suit (not a bad agreement imo)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes agree with that|pg||
nt|eleni: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Albena/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=890  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: of course south might not think he has a double of this - if his partner had bid 4@H off a diamond fit he certainly wouldn't have|pg||
nt|gmarco24: they gonna double this. right?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Whaever u say: THe bidding by E doesnt look like a describing auction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree.|pg||
nt|eleni: right Richard|pg||
nt|riccho:  Its sheer luck that 7@s is not an obvious contract |pg||
nt|loe48: der er ingen valg|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|eleni: You are so right Pekka|pg||
nt|chrisky: an easy 3nt contract|pg||

nt|panja: let us say CJ goes to @CQ..|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Lina|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|eleni: this makes life easier for Giannakis|pg||

nt|smirny: i dont think you could stop after 3S and 4H of pd too|pg||
nt|smirny: or i could stop|pg||
nt|andy_h: If South was going to bid 6@D then I think she should have just bid 5@C over 3@S (assuming Exclusion keycard). I think the 4@H cue-bid (which implicitly shows a club control since ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D technically denies a club control) didn't do much good to her hand|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes @c lead needed in slam -right |pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|andy_h: I think the other table is going off in 4@S|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: well he had 5@D and a void in @H... worth trying for the vul game|pg||
nt|neobas: Of course 6@S also works due to the @S break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: with 15 points ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 4 possible lines: heart finesse; drop hearts and then play to @CK; play strip squeeze|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y. A good one for Germany|pg||
nt|spenny80: impossibile to bid 5@h/5@c for me with 2 balanced hand|pg||

nt|runnerup: to think here |pg||
nt|eleni: good defense by the Italian girls|pg||
nt|chrisky: 6@d|pg||
nt|antoniz: widzê prezenty,oby wiecej|pg||
nt|andreasw:  missclaim?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: indeed.|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes. But I dont understand the trump lead in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: except for the revoke part, they have played well. May that was an eye opener.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 7@D maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: or - cud North's @H 8 come into play after @C lead?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW better not press by there sac.|pg||
nt|spenny80: here difficult don.t bid slam, defeat by ruff in @h|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    spades for e/w|pg||
nt|rensph: picked up a few imps on board 11|pg||
nt|friggi: Sverige slaar tilbage:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sunsamvar: today the @H suit is breaking badly|pg||
nt|loe48: den skal vel meldes ut eller?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: looks like 4@H will make anyhow|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT showing Black suits?|pg||
nt|bagman: Most players would go down in 6@S trying to drop the hearts and then play up to the @CK (on trump or diamond lead)|pg||
nt|spenny80: but not easy to found|pg||
nt|galois85: 3@d rubensohl |pg||
nt|raghavan: only 2 Spade loser in H contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: be|pg||
nt|vasmar: this can be a crucial board|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult bidding though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 1 nt must be some kind of 2 suitor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S off 2 i think|pg||
nt|loe48: maybe they find 4s if 1s-3s|pg||
nt|rensph: Would you overcall over 1NT with E, and would you bid both majors or show just spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: if they bid 7NT they have to find Q@h|pg||
nt|eleni: a nice 6NT with a good @h guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  end of auction|pg||
nt|chrisky: finally 1 imp...........|pg||
nt|athene: in standard precision 2@C asks partner about his support for clubs and his general hand strength|pg||
nt|pinticus: 6@d seems cold|pg||
nt|vasmar: and 7 if you ruff 2 clubs or make 3@S tricks|pg||
nt|loe48: 8 med single kloever og makke tigget|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Mikael fandt @d udspillet|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i spil 8:)|pg||
nt|rubrean:  Ja, etter 8 gode spill fra Norge, har Sverige slÃ¥tt hardt tilbake med godt spill|pg||
mb|2N|nt|runnerup: 4 @s has its merits over 4 @h but 5 must be too much|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 5h |pg||
nt|raghavan: since voluntary bid of 4h shows min 3 cds|pg||
nt|ady: would not overcall|pg||
nt|rensph: 6-4 can lead to problems showing your hand with either bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: shud make +1|pg||
nt|famus: on a @c lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: These youn players are steady and good in bidding |pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says not @CQxx or better, and only 2 controls|pg||
nt|spenny80: 3@c I don.to know, maybe short|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3!X short or que SiSi?|pg||
nt|rubrean:  / gode spill|pg||
nt|andreasw:  pas og kridt dine 7 stik|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes carl|pg||
nt|famus: might get his !q or 10|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
nt|eleni: difficult hand for Peter, let us hope he counts it out really well, as he usually does|pg||
nt|loe48: west has not many loosers hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roussol: 6NT always done without the Q@h|pg||
nt|roussol: 12 tricks at least|pg||
nt|raghavan: lead gains trick|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 3@h - max|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@H would now be another ask and north by jumping just shows this is a choice of games auction, not a slam auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C sorry|pg||
nt|spenny80: 4@d clear splinter, but for me this isn't the hand to do a splinter in south|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT limit raise or better in @s|pg||
nt|eleni: oooooooooooops a passive bid|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think 4NT by N should be more accurate|pg||
nt|eleni: Let us hope Flavia keepos it on|pg||
nt|chrisky: if u ruff 2 @C no need 3@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: North decided to defend|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but cant blame North for not competing|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  thought W was weaker|pg||

nt|rensph: E showing minimum with spades.. Seems reasonable :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: N never decribed her 17 count|pg||
pc|d2|nt|loe48: i bid 4s after 1s-3s..all u need is 4 spades and xx club to make, and suits behave..so its playable without hp support|pg||
nt|loe48: so im not surprised if hey bid 4s|pg||
nt|raghavan: wont pass 5D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andy_h: And here I was trying to analyse the (tricky) play in 4@H but they have stopped in 3NT due to the potential bad breaks as advertised from 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: 3@C = ask for void/singelton|pg||
nt|spenny80: if you bid splinter and after a negativ bid you ask aces, then you didn't do a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good spot   with some excellent cards opposite  and still not getting to high|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: Hope that W also knows that this is conventional|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4@H is very tricky|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3NT needs some thinking too though|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  esp. since he is expecting @SA to be off|pg||
nt|andy_h: If the hearts break then declarer has no sweat here as he just needs to give up a spade, but of course he is now thinking how the play should go if the hearts break unfriendly as ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: it is here|pg||
nt|smirny: 55 @S@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5@D is sure?|pg||
nt|smirny: and probably 2+@C|pg||
nt|andy_h: Still, playing on hearts is the best prospect so declarer should start on that|pg||
nt|smirny: as they open 3C with 7|pg||
nt|smirny: so hearts should be 1-4 or 0-3|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  0-3 would be nice|pg||
nt|smirny: sorry|pg||
nt|smirny: 0-5|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if @SA is in N it is pretty safe to duck a @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then take 2nd @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@D 4@H @CA @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: These clever gadgets can be very good thing or a very bad thing - here it's bad because declarer can now infact play double dummy since North's distribution is advertised|pg||
nt|andy_h: I think declarer can succeed by playing on hearts and putting pressure on North |pg||
nt|athene: yes sorry 2@D might be 0-3 controls, not specifically 2|pg||
nt|frankbo: blir ikke mange beit her|pg||
pc|h7|nt|atalok: hala olmuyor ama oynayýp batmak normal|pg||

nt|raghavan: OH???|pg||

nt|gmarco24: sry all|pg||

nt|yusufb: evet bunu oynayýp batmak normali|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roussol: well done|pg||
nt|desinka: @D lead I guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead at E|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4 top tricks for denmark|pg||
pc|h9|nt|spenny80: after sgl @c in north and sgl @d in south, @h lead is possible now|pg||
nt|spenny80: no easy|pg||
nt|spenny80: good 4@h in closed room, after 1@d open better minor (easier now)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gmarco24: how would you bid as natural William?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like to follow more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|galois85: but  1nt... difficult singl in spades...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|eleni: yes 12 are a lay down, inspirational L and J@h play gives the overtrick:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bagman: A good lead|pg||
nt|eleni: That was a safe lead by S|pg||
nt|bagman: (much better than @HA)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  he would if @SA would also be in N|pg||

nt|athene: because if south has @HA and @DJ why would he throw a winner?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: he saved himself troubles thinking through that by discarding wrong suit, so...  :)|pg||

nt|raghavan: now dropping DK alone matters - spade loser will go in Clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: My personal favourite defence against 2@C both majors is unusual-over-unusual. 2D=Nat NF, 2H=clubs, 2S=diamonds, 2NT=Nat, 3C=both minors invite, 3D=both minors GF, 3M=shortage|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  5NT is a dangerous bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if you arent even sure yourself, how can partner be|pg||
nt|henryb:  With @h 4-4 this is not a challenging hand; If @h were 5-3 declarer would have to find the @cQ|pg||

nt|athene: i guess over 5@D, 5NT should be a two-suiter with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so this can't really be showing black suits |pg||
nt|chmitty: North thinking ... if South has clubs instead of @h then 7 might be here|pg||
nt|athene: it would not make sense to offer a choice between 6@S and 7@C anyway|pg||
nt|cicus: and bid 7 on the strength of @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe north will think south is showing a huge spade hand with a club side suit|pg||
nt|cicus: sry priv|pg||
nt|athene: so asking for club strength for 7|pg||
nt|athene: these things are never as obvious as they appear - if there is a creative way partner can misinterpret your "brilliant" bid, he will take it|pg||

nt|chmitty: That will give them a theme for discussion at diner :)|pg||
nt|athene: very few pairs have agreements in this sort of wild auction - of course these things don't come up much, but when they do, there tend to be 17-imp swings kicking around|pg||

mb|6C|nt|chmitty: true : you have to discuss in depth what would 5NT mean as compared to 6@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: so thanks was a bit premature|pg||
nt|raghavan: between them NS have 14 losers |pg||
nt|famus: i think he was thinking right about the final entry for running @ds if the @D fin fails or even if it works--@Sa was the right play|pg||
nt|runnerup: this time both aces @h and @c right but you surely dont want to squese table by taking @d at once|pg||

nt|galois85: wow... trying to go -1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andy_h: Dare I say, maybe the solution is for West to open his hand 2@C even though it's generally not good to open 2 or 3-suiter hands with 2@C in fear of interference|pg||

nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: Well you look at your void and the vulnerability - if the opponent's are NV then they are more than likely to interfere|pg||
nt|athene: not sure, i guess something like that|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north could have doubled one of west's spade bids to emphasize his spade suit and try to wake his partner up|pg||
nt|chmitty: anyhow last hand now :) tx all and see you in a little more than 1 hour for the last match of the day @h:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board, ty all. see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I was thinking how to go down|pg||
nt|galois85: but luckily for declearer it was the same...|pg||
nt|blum1956: Very strange - if the declarer has @d J10x raising with the Ace still guarantees two diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the set|pg||
nt|rensph: south had shown 9 already... could he have held 11=|pg||

nt|spenny80: yess see you all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: ty Fabio and Frank|pg||
mb|1C|nt|petergill: And conservative old? me? I think that 1@c has 4+ cards more than half the time, so a stopper would be very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: see you at 14.30|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Ish's excellent rapid discarding on the long clubs fooled NS - typical Ish Delmonte, getting 90 out of the mire with fine deceptive card play|pg||
nt|raghavan: Germany has improved a litte getting 12 imp on Bd 18|pg||
nt|vugraphzjk: last board of this round, ty all. see you after about 2 hours|pg||
nt|andy_h: However given West's 5-5 I think he still has a solution if the opponent's butt in up to 4@S - he could bid a two-suited takeout |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the last hand of the match - many thanks to our excellent operator in Albena, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and congrats to the Swedish team on this win|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  although this hand...|pg||
nt|andy_h: he could bid 4NT a two suited takeout*|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D = both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with longer spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D = shows about what East has: I think they play it as 5+ spades and 4 @H |pg||
nt|galois85: yes, but thanks to KF and AQ it seems an impossible leading... |pg||
nt|galois85: 2nt shows 6@h and 4 in another (minor?)|pg||
