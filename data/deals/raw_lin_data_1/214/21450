nt|ahollan1: Gitelman also started with 2@D !!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss declaring 5@C East|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well the thing is that the 2@D transfer specifically can carry meanings other than hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Those other meanings are usually instigated with responder following up with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we first saw that in "Walsh relays"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that didn't include (13)(54) hands|pg||
