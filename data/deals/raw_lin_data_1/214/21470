nt|odysseus69: lead now 21|pg||
nt|clinch: Robson wondering whether to cover... doesn't make a difference as it happens, but if he doesn't, Lee must attack clubs|pg||
nt|clinch: Robson is not one of bridge's quickest players|pg||
nt|clinch: Lots of comments, but effectively the heart suit doesn't now matter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the delay does suggest that Robson has a club honour and since contact cant make if it is a singleton honour declarer should get home whether he covers or not|pg||
