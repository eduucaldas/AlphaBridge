mb|d|nt|vugraphzsw: Welcome back to stanza 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 5 spades 4 Hearts weak|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  since the 1@D opening doesn't promise diamonds (IIRC) this shows both minors|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  it coudl be imporant to cash the clubs now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  North has seen his partner play the lowest two possible diamonds on the first two rounds - surely a club signal|pg||

pc|d6|nt|capercliff:  hard hand for N to judge holding KQJx in @h, the VUL game was too tempting|pg||
nt|idc:  Just 12 boards left after this one, 54 IMPs is a lot to recover|pg||
nt|capercliff:  its one of these hands where if 4@s goes one off you shrug your shoulders|pg||

nt|capercliff:  4@d is also an option, if partner will take this for a @s fit as well|pg||
nt|idc:  I expect Gold will play for this layout, except hope that East has @sKQx, so no ruff for West|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not much going Irens way today|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  opening a weak two with 7cds happens fairly often, when the urge to bid conflicts with the concern about 3@H/3@S being too risky|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S hand a legitimate chance (not as cards lie) by cashing both red aces then playing spade ace and spade. if hearts are 44 and spades 33, defense after taking their fourth trick ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must lead a minor. then if Ds 33 and clubs also with Q onside, there would be no defence. S  correctly gauged that the hearts were  53|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  anotehr bid swing to the Allfrey team - must have gained about 60 imps in the last 14 boards|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the bidding has had North show the oterh threee suits, so hearts is surely his weakness|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|pjs_ch:  hhere 1@C shows 16+ and there are a lot of speicalist responses|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|pjs_ch:  This is a tight contract, and being forced early doesn't suit declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  NS here leading 3rd & 5th in partner's suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the auction he can assume D ace onside, and on the lack of club lead he can assume N does not have a stiff. so he can  play 2 trumps and then a low club|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  Bakhshi can place partner with the @HK and one other high card. If the @DK he might need to cash quickly|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: 2 top trumps in hand i mean|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  he'll find out by cashing the @DA and seeing partner's signal, but he'lll have eased declarer's problems too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|pjs_ch:  no @DK so back to hearts|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not entirely eased|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict the line i have recommended|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  true - if declarer draws trumps he has a heart to lose if the @CK is offside.  He might play clubs before all the trumps are drawn to allow for that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  although it is not without risk as Kxx of clubs could win and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why he would xcash ace first|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  does this have the same risks but gain with a singleton @CK?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is no risk in losing to a stiff king once two trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  no - it makes it difficult to draw the last trump |pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: looks like a clear misplay to me, maybe i am missing something|pg||
