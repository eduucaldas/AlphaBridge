mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 17 & 18 are being thrown out because one of the Norweigan players arrived late to Open Room|pg||

nt|swanson: Responding to 1@D is a dubvious idea.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can North sit the DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the @S holding is nice, but the rest looks bad |pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT looks sound to me.  His minors are very soft to be sitting for the double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i  forgot that sometimes 2N is natural |pg||
nt|swanson: If he does sit, the AJ7 of spades in dummy will be quite disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it makes sense to use 2N as a scramble too|pg||
nt|swanson: Partner must have clubs and hearts for the double - 2NT natural is most logical.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Charlsen didn't realize he was supposed to bid with Willenken hand  [over 1@C] |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|swanson: North made it clear that his notrump bid was natural.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now   what does Rosenberg lead     was anything easy here after the opening bid?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: in other room  Sontag scrambles into 2@D South|pg||
nt|swanson: I have some sympathy for this exuberant looking bid. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row    2@D for USA vs  3N for Norway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: and probably 2nd hand in a row where USA plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club and 3 diamonds.  Perhaps if West doesn't lead a club (when in with a heart) he will win an extra minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event is by invitation only   4 6-person teams each in Open and Women's  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open:  China  Netherlands  Norway  USA    Women: China England France USA|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: i think the invitees [except for China Open]  all from countries that have recent win in World Championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Originally Italy was going to play in the Open   When they withdrew  Netherlands entered as newly crowned Bermuda Bowl winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to know what it's like to win a Bermuda Bowl --- read John's book :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|swanson: The @S5 on the first trick wasn't very informative.  |pg||
nt|swanson: Also if you want to know what it's like to finish last.|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg is making all the right plays.  The defense now has 2 spades, 2 hearts and a club coming.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: was @S9 [or 8] better here?  or is this a count situation with @S3?|pg||

nt|migry: i think west was dissuated from bidding 4@s because of the way the opponents bid it|pg||
