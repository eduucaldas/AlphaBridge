nt|ahollan1: EW play a lot of equal level conversions, but surely deWijs has MUCH more than promised on the auction|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S much safef playing a strong 1@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: since max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not too keen on the 2H as it wont be possible later to put suit lengths in proper perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@H, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||

nt|migry: perfect:)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: will land on feet i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the scoring is different than we're used to:   instead of converting imps to VPs, the score is the imp difference with maximum of 46|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  either NS are olkaying weak NT or else N decided to promote the N hand because of the diamonds. the other suits are so soft, though, that it is a very close call|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: oops|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 2N=super max, 3-fit @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another benefit of 3C is that partner knows you have a good hand, as it is GF. 2H could just be a 10 count. if you bid 3C and then 4H, partner has to take it seriously|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi:  slam should be reached here without breathing hard|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DQ wasted but 4@H still has play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi:  i think 3S is the best call in theory, but if this sequence has not been discussed there is some danger in that course of action|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi:  the 4C call was very prudent if 3S has not been discussed|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  N would have stopped faffing about long ago and bid 6C were it not for the possibility of a grand slam|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|migry: and so does 4@s:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: if there was a possibility that opps would bid spades, then the situation is more complicated, but since partner opened 1S, you can handle continuations with aplomb|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi:  if you play a forcing club, there is a fair case for not using it at unfavorable colors. or perhaps playing ACOL 2-bids, at least in suits other than spades. but few players want their system to be a garden of forking paths on the first round |pg||

pc|d2|nt|marlowepi:  these allsuions are from perhaps the most enjoyable bridge book ever "Bridge in the Menagerie" by the amazing Victor Mollo (and its sequels)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought after not choosing Drury  Rosenberg MIGHT [keyword] DBL 3@D|pg||
nt|migry: a double would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not many left who even think about 1@C anymore|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|migry: i think that double by north should be penalty|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 7@C make?   maybe  but getting there is too tough  and then must play @D correctly|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not because all 55 blacks should be opened 1C (dfar from it), but because you have 5 clubs and fourish spades:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact the Washington DC crowd would say  if you open a minor, you do NOT have 5-card major   5008 = 1@S|pg||
