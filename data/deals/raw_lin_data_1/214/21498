mb|p|nt|chick: apparently NS play a strong club, so won't be hard to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: welcome back for the final round taking place in "the Venice of the north", Stockholm, with it's 14 islands linked by 57 bridges|pg||
pc|h3|nt|penseur9: good bridge all|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|chick: has to be in spades though|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is hard to avoid -good fit + all the controls|pg||
nt|chick: club slam will fail on the club loser and spade finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: same for 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, the bad part is that both rooms will probably bid the same contract for a push|pg||

nt|penseur9: this tournament is taking place in the capital of Sueden, Stockholm... populaton more then a million|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: 6@C could actually have made on the heart lead it got in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: sad, but the 5-2 fit makes slam, the 6-2 fails|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where a strong club relay system works well|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can eliminate and throw East in with a club to the jack to lead away from @SK|pg||
nt|penseur9: Can the Jörgen team overcome their 20 IMPs deficit... we'll see :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: still n/s have fallen on their feet - for first blood|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: not enough though, due to the fact that 5@S is good|pg||

nt|penseur9: 1@D = 0-7 points|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: probalby can make 4@H, but needs good guess in hearts, @SA onside, @DK onside, so not a good game|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: no overcall in the other room made it easier to get to this risky game|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, at least it is accurate in that it is weak|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: it might have the effect of pushing eW to a game that they wouldnt have bid without being pushed.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: with @CQ dropping, this has good chances |pg||

nt|ady: somewhat fortunate though   without Q@C coming down  this would be a different story|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: this looks like 11 imps to the leaders|pg||
nt|jbennet: so the super wk jump to 2 level (a huge long term losing gadget which will diappear as a result of evolution). might have cost a game swing. |pg||

nt|jbennet: being a resultmerchant ; had North just bid 1 h then  west had rebid 1NT. (18-19) East might have bid on, but more likely had he passed 1 NT..|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: nothing wrong with being a result merchant (it's results that count), but yes, West would probably have been allowed ot play 1NT if he had been able to bid it    |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the margin stretches|pg||
nt|ady: has beeen pointed out that if diamonds split 3-3   and there is stiff Q@C   then 3NT could make playing that way    a valid point|pg||
nt|jbennet: so lucky perhaps, but north did indeed know that p strength was under the gun, + xxx,jx in minors suggests favourabel lie for EW.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: as 3NT I suspect shows two spades only (no acceptance of transfer)|pg||
nt|jbennet: making if either of the black suits comes down. |pg||

nt|penseur9: right side for defense though :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9: big swing on  39 with 5@D going down doubled in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9: double dummy, 4@S makes but....|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: hmm i would have opened 1@D AND THEN REVERSED INTO HEARTS -GIVING PARD A CHANCE TO PASS(AS HERE)LEADS TO TOO MANY MISSED GAMES|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|penseur9: I try to answer as many private messages as possible... if I miss some I'm sorry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: I'm a firm believer in opening longest first in all 6-5 hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|chick: even if the rebid is a reverse, any 6-5 is strong enough to do that|pg||
nt|penseur9: right|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|penseur9: welcome to this 3rd round of this final|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|penseur9: 14 boards segment|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|penseur9: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm afraid I don't sorry|pg||
nt|chick: don't know who the players are yet either :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: we'll figure something out :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks like 1nt or 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure the operator will get names in the seats and let us know as soon as he has time|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i have been asked how the bidding might go -1nt all pass by west|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 2@D NS|pg||
nt|penseur9: this looks like a warm up hand :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i might try 3@D if i was south but that is off-center|pg||
nt|chick: 1N P P 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: assuming that's not conventional for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible but nat overcalls of 1nt have rather gone out of fashion|pg||
nt|chick: actually, I very much prefer them in the balance/passout seat|pg||
nt|penseur9: Nice of Linus (operator) to put in full names of players... not anough do it|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah the formal side of the Swedes|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board here this round...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: off we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: except we have only one player in N and S :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: only 3 IMPs diff now... wow what a match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: Ulla-Britt Goldberg playing both seats :)|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of the session today|pg||
nt|penseur9: great job by Linus Jorenbo our operator... well done|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Linus, which Goldberg is N and which South? We need an initisal,   UB    L|pg||
nt|roswolf:  ) goldberg and i are soulmates:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Married couple  Ulla-Britt and Lars|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chick: Many play 3@D as invitation to 3N if partner has diamond controls|pg||
nt|penseur9: the final round should start in about 25 minutes... or a little less|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|penseur9: could be down one but still the board|pg||
nt|penseur9: *still win the board|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: Apparently here it is a strong version of Michaels, showing the majors|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9: great round for the J¨0rgen team|pg||
nt|penseur9: *Jörgen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: A spade switch now will give declarer problems and probably make the @HK for North|pg||
nt|chick: either by ruff or because Upmark will have to lead hearts away from dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: the problem here is to enter dummy, decl has to trust opps to make it for him|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|chick: This event continues on Wednesday and hopefully we will have more vugraph of it then|pg||
nt|chick: now a heart finesse and the @HA will pick up the entire trump suit|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, he is forced to play for Kx|pg||
nt|friggi: ty all bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzue: the scores will be corrected |pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: north might not give south her ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|penseur9: OK thanks Linus|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|penseur9: on 40 the OR sropped at 4@H for an 11 IMPs gain|pg||
nt|vugraphzue: vulnebilities have been messed up on all boards hopefulyl we will fix this for next set|pg||
nt|penseur9: gain for the Goldberg team that is|pg||
