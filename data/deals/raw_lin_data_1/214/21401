nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Cliff Gillis|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  Crouch -Patterson have some fairly complicated agreements|pg||
nt|capercliff:  good afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: here it looks like Townsend made a lead directional double and might play here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sorry there as spec points out a strong club from north, so last comment retracted, please|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff:  the wheels fell off here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: X was undiscussed|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: XX would have been to play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north might have discussed it with xx|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: Pass was no clear bid to make...essentially neutral|pg||
nt|capercliff:  E/W have dodged a bullit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|capercliff:  maybe South misinturpreted North's pass|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: fired it themselves though|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3Cxx +1 would have hurt - when a lead directional double ends the bidding it is usually bad news for the doubler|pg||

nt|odysseus69: the precise description of 3C -8-11 -4-3-3-3 with 4 card minor - makes it logical for South to xx to show 4 clubs|pg||
