nt|Walddk2: D    T|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting with two Tommy G|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daniel and Tommy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: are they related?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|topbjorn:  tough bidding. When king of spades on the wrong position, the slam will go one down|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: certainly not a terrible slam   but wont make|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chick: has to be in spades though|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is hard to avoid -good fit + all the controls|pg||
nt|chick: club slam will fail on the club loser and spade finesse|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chick: same for 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes, the bad part is that both rooms will probably bid the same contract for a push|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C could actually have made on the heart lead it got in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: sad, but the 5-2 fit makes slam, the 6-2 fails|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where a strong club relay system works well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: You can eliminate and throw East in with a club to the jack to lead away from @SK|pg||
