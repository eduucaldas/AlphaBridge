pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

nt|marlowepi: suspect S wont duck this:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: when we began this set a few scant boards ago, the match was nearly even. now margin beginning to yawn wider (though we are not), at least for the moment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual, the bidding has been the decisive factor  -- almost the only factor, actually. declarer coups get the headlines, but bidding wins and loses matches. a bit like the golf ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: adage "drive for show, putt for dough"|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|dkkello:  nobody really have good agrements how to bid hands like this ..|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: N has enough to RD (if that is natural), but at these colors short in spades it is a bit dangerous since that call invites E to preempt in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|dkkello:  5 @D making N-S   but how to bid it ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  4 @S mabye better  ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|dkkello:  easy !  well done |pg||

nt|dkkello:  ;)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|dkkello:  can he bid more?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends what 2@D showed i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 8 tricks but W will have to discrad twice and won't enjoy it|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: with me it's stronger that what Gold has|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: due to delicate entry position, perhaps a diamond to the jack would have been better|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it could be that 2@D is weaker than 2@S|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this still looks -1 for a flat board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was hoping W had heart KQ, as then he could build a trick in that suit while not compromising anything. club to queen would have left taht suit one lead away from wide open. but ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think first D to jack was the way to go|pg||

pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: often doubler WOULD have both heart honors, but here it rather looks from the auction and the lead that E led from 3 small. thus restricted choice makes it less likely that W holds ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both heart pictures, as he might have led a heart instead of a spade if he had only small ones|pg||

nt|marlowepi: doubleton queen wouldnt add any lustre to a shaded T/O double|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: rather eccentric 1N opener, but clearly W wants to press the advantage. stiff queen is a reasonably good holding for NT (certainly better than stiff ace), but the hand does sort of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: scream for a 1H opening under normal circumstances. here 1N effectively shut out the spades, though maybe NS were never going to bid anyway|pg||
