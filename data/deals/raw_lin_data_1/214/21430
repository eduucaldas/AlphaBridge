nt|ahollan1: top 2 then play head-to-head for 1st/2nd place and the other 2 playoff for 3rd/4th|pg||

mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: will land on feet i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the scoring is different than we're used to:   instead of converting imps to VPs, the score is the imp difference with maximum of 46|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  either NS are olkaying weak NT or else N decided to promote the N hand because of the diamonds. the other suits are so soft, though, that it is a very close call|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=super max, 3-fit @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another benefit of 3C is that partner knows you have a good hand, as it is GF. 2H could just be a 10 count. if you bid 3C and then 4H, partner has to take it seriously|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: the more hearts you have, the more room for clubs in partner's hand. and dummy's trumps sit over those of E who is also short in hearts|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  i think 3S is the best call in theory, but if this sequence has not been discussed there is some danger in that course of action|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi:  the 4C call was very prudent if 3S has not been discussed|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  N would have stopped faffing about long ago and bid 6C were it not for the possibility of a grand slam|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi:  having said that, there is no clear path for her toward that objective without detailed understandigs|pg||
nt|migry: and so does 4@s:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: if there was a possibility that opps would bid spades, then the situation is more complicated, but since partner opened 1S, you can handle continuations with aplomb|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C again|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  LOL sometimes you dont lose, it is a generalization. we all get lucky sometimes. except for karapoet, of course:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11(12) HCP, BAL  [no singleton/void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  7222 is balanced|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty good hand for weak 2 at these colors. many would open tactical 1D. of course if playing strong club that gambit has less to recommend it and 2D is probably better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: play 2x to @CJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: big win possible|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rasmussen didn't open 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for Dutch|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i'm told in ladies  both  3@C-DBL-P-3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vul  seems strange to convert to penalty rather than bidding a vul game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could have held 5@H  [but not 6+]|pg||

nt|jaapfr: can not go wrong here and will make|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi:  not much here, the systemi 2D made the auction easy. however it is very important o be realistic in judging the merits of a given method. the crucial question is NOT "did it reach a good spot"..... (more on the way)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why should he go down?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: reference 2@D opening|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: we know the schedule of matches, but not who will be on vugraph :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening lead made big difference. so much for lead-directors. heart queen in other room induce michael rosenberg to play club toward king, with very cruel reults|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  rest in peace, Djoulikian:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on a different auction, i think vP would have been in 4@S -1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@S?     [i read a lot of Acol books in my formative years]|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @H, INV+|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  that is his LAST name:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: to be fair: 2 somewhat lucky boards for Dutch made the scoring difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: b9 and b12|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: E trying to sow confusion with 2H, but not at all clear at these colors that a hand with only a moderate offense-to-defense ratio should take that tack|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: pick a slam|pg||
nt|migry: actually i thought they would open 1@c |pg||
nt|migry: for me always 1@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi:  these allsuions are from perhaps the most enjoyable bridge book ever "Bridge in the Menagerie" by the amazing Victor Mollo (and its sequels)|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  i like opening on the N hand, but if system permits i think 1C is superior|pg||

nt|jaapfr: you your Chinese Marshall:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: well done to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought after not choosing Drury  Rosenberg MIGHT [keyword] DBL 3@D|pg||
nt|migry: a double would have worked better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not many left who even think about 1@C anymore|pg||
pc|c5|nt|migry: i think that double by north should be penalty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: marshall arts:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: does 7@C make?   maybe  but getting there is too tough  and then must play @D correctly|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not because all 55 blacks should be opened 1C (dfar from it), but because you have 5 clubs and fourish spades:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact the Washington DC crowd would say  if you open a minor, you do NOT have 5-card major   5008 = 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is our final board of the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks for joining and staying awake Migry|pg||
nt|migry: Thanks Al:) awake is not quite the right word:) you did a great job|pg||
