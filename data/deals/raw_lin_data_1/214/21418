nt|vugraphzsy: she is fingering her A@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It has been confirmed that Hallberg is playing in the other room, so North here is indeed Björnlund|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sorry in the other table as we have Gunnar playing at both tables:)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so to speak|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsx: 3c - asking about hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzsx: 3d- hasnt got 3 hearts, doesnt like clubs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pjs_ch:  this looks like the inevitable contract but with the @SK over the @SQ it's in some trouble|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|pjs_ch:  from declarer's perspective either hand could have the @SK; after that duck, he must be feeling quite positive|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this would have been the 9th trick if it worked, which is why he tried the king rather than the jack (more likely to win)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the @S5 at trick one won't have been easy for West to read as encouraging but after the play to date,what else can partner have but the @SK?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  possibly the @CJ in East is enough to beat it at this point?|pg||

mb|2N|nt|pjs_ch:  here 2@D is multi which coudl be a weak two or a strong hand like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  or perhaps not ?|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  breaking the transfer here looks like it shows good heart support|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the North hand is so so slam suitable - no wasted quacks around - he should continue to cooperate now|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  he didn't want to take charge with Blackwood because he coundn't count tricks - better to leave it to partner.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the pass over the double let North show the @DK and with (at least) the @CK outstanding South knows that 6 is enough|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pjs_ch:  there isn't 12 top tricks but when the @CK is known (?) to be with East, there are 12 in sight|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  one diamond ruff makes 6 trump tricks and two in each other suit makes 12|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: true IF W did lead @HJ Zia would call the referee|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or his mother or the TD:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be nip and tuck|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which means?|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 is more likely than -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Halberg went a little bezerk in the other room at white|pg||
nt|ritong: this will nedd more than magic, given the layout|pg||
nt|ritong: need*|pg||
nt|cameron_1: sadly Halberg has alreadt crustalised the bad board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with neither minor breaking hard to see how this can get home|pg||
nt|jbennet: after 2 sp overcall east could have made an inviting bid rather than take a unilateral decision.|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer can see he s home with friendly @cs|pg||
nt|cameron_1: 4@s was just bonkers|pg||
nt|ritong: so, he s trying to manage a plan B if it is not the case|pg||
nt|ritong: @ds also can provide tricks|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if the clubs behave declarer was ok, so has to play this|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|ritong: sure|pg||
nt|jbennet: now if the d were producing 4 tricks declare would have had no benefit from it.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: the question was: do i draw AK first|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: @D is the EW trick so no @S for NS left|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oeff now indeed tuck|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if someone shows out, is there an other solution?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d6|nt|jbennet: neither plan had worked but declare could have banged down kl ace,king, and then had time to develop diamonods if possible.|pg||
mc|9|nt|jaapfr: sensational push|pg||
nt|ritong: like KJ stiff or J stiff offside|pg||

pc|s5|nt|pjs_ch:  seems natural for King to throw away what he doesn't want|pg||
