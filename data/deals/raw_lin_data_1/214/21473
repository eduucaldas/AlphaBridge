mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this would probably be an opener for W if NV|pg||

nt|vbman: 4 inescapable loosers|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||

nt|marlowepi: bulk of your side's assets and you can see the peril looming. the low heart lead was fine, but then when in again the diamond queen is probably the percentage shot. probably wont ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3D!|mb|4D|nt|bernix: a 20/20 deal usually leads to a partscore battle (or a pass-out)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this would not be everyones choice to open 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|bernix: with no long suits this will be passed out on 1-level|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I think the benefit of getting a 6-card suit to the K10 across to pd, even with the drawback of jxxx in hearts on the side, makes 2@S fairly popular.|pg||
