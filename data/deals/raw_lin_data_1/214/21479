mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|chick: has to be in spades though|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is hard to avoid -good fit + all the controls|pg||
nt|chick: club slam will fail on the club loser and spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: same for 6N|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 6@C could actually have made on the heart lead it got in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: sad, but the 5-2 fit makes slam, the 6-2 fails|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where a strong club relay system works well|pg||

mb|2C|nt|chick: probalby can make 4@H, but needs good guess in hearts, @SA onside, @DK onside, so not a good game|pg||
