nt|swanson: Responding to 1@D is a dubvious idea.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can North sit the DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the @S holding is nice, but the rest looks bad |pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT looks sound to me.  His minors are very soft to be sitting for the double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i  forgot that sometimes 2N is natural |pg||
nt|swanson: If he does sit, the AJ7 of spades in dummy will be quite disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it makes sense to use 2N as a scramble too|pg||
nt|swanson: Partner must have clubs and hearts for the double - 2NT natural is most logical.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Charlsen didn't realize he was supposed to bid with Willenken hand  [over 1@C] |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wonder if 2@c was alerted|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pretty aggressive bidding:)|pg||
nt|psyck: E must have shown an invitaional hand with 5 @s's, & West accepted the try|pg||
pc|h4|nt|swanson: North made it clear that his notrump bid was natural.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now   what does Rosenberg lead     was anything easy here after the opening bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead very helpful|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: in other room  Sontag scrambles into 2@D South|pg||
nt|swanson: I have some sympathy for this exuberant looking bid. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row    2@D for USA vs  3N for Norway|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and most cards well placed it is declarer to be favorite here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: and probably 2nd hand in a row where USA plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club and 3 diamonds.  Perhaps if West doesn't lead a club (when in with a heart) he will win an extra minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event is by invitation only   4 6-person teams each in Open and Women's  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open:  China  Netherlands  Norway  USA    Women: China England France USA|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jaapfr: this creates a losing option|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: a tough call & W correctly takes his time for the best play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: i think the invitees [except for China Open]  all from countries that have recent win in World Championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Originally Italy was going to play in the Open   When they withdrew  Netherlands entered as newly crowned Bermuda Bowl winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to know what it's like to win a Bermuda Bowl --- read John's book :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|swanson: The @S5 on the first trick wasn't very informative.  |pg||
nt|swanson: Also if you want to know what it's like to finish last.|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg is making all the right plays.  The defense now has 2 spades, 2 hearts and a club coming.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: still 5 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Malinowski wasn't so far off the mark with 3NT. |pg||
nt|swanson: Defense to notrump contract is frequently difficult (if not impossible) with all the defender's high cards in one hand|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed Davis (expert from SOuthern California) played against ROsenberg and his wife in the recent Nationals.|pg||
nt|swanson: Michael psyched 1C with a strong 3-5-3-2 hand, declared 3NT - Ed didn't find a club lead holding AKXX and Rosenberg took all the tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed's partner, Jill Meyers held QJxxx of clubs.  |pg||
nt|swanson: They met again later in the tournament and Rosenberg blanked a king - Ed misguessed and finessed into him.|pg||
nt|swanson: Losing all of the remaining tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: We have no information on why the play has been delayed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is either great tribute to Rosenberg  or  harsh dig of Ed|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed is my best partner - a superb played.  Just shows how you can get had by anothe great player.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China off to early 14-0 lead against Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delay is that  new boards 17 & 18 are in play  and not available to vugraph operator|pg||
nt|migry: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the original 17 & 18 had to be thrown out because one of the Norweigan players arrived late to Open Room|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg, I don't believe, would consider psyching 1C in an IMP game, but it matchpoints stealing is the rule.|pg||
nt|swanson: HI Migry.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: North-South not playing support dbl??   if not, what about 2@H?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, nothing much in this hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|migry: as North could have doubled to show 3 cards in heart|pg||
pc|h2|nt|migry: X by west is a game try in spades|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with 28 hcp still a bit work to do|pg||
nt|psyck: but E in trouble with all cards|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: in other room  Berkowitz-Sontag play a form of Precision -- that's why opening bid was 1@D|pg||
nt|migry: 4@s would be 2 down so had west bid it, it could have been  a 8IMPs swing|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: finding @DJ will be very helpful|pg||
nt|psyck: only 2 tricks in each suit, but defense will give 9th soon|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|migry: i think west was dissuated from bidding 4@s because of the way the opponents bid it|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 44 vul opposite passed hand  seems very frisky|pg||
nt|swanson: That's a dangerous vul vs not entry into the auction in my view - but will be a huge success.|pg||
nt|migry: lots of 10s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: So Drijver makes sure of his 2 club tricks and ducking 1 club trick without West getting on lead|pg||

nt|kit: That is one of the greatest plays I have ever seen|pg||
nt|jaapfr: glad I asked to join us whilst we would have regarded it as an operators foul:)|pg||
nt|kit: I did think it was, until the operator insisted it was what happened -- then it was worth a closer look|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only point is why did he not playb @CQ in the first place?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: about  this simple looking 28 hcp 3nt play|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H split is troublesome after 3rd round of @D ruffed|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer need to duck a spade a some point to avoid an uppercut.|pg||
nt|kit: well, first good guess by declarer -- now he needs one more at least|pg||
nt|kit: I think the reason he guess the clubs right was that he figured if Gitelman didn't have ace of clubs he would have led a club, not a diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: how about play at trick 3    small @S or @SJ/10 from dummy??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with hcp counting finds @SQ with E more likely and 3@C suggests distributional hands so i favor BRINK TO TAKE @s FINESSE|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry caps|pg||
nt|psyck: he needs some ruffs too, so donno if can manage @s fin if guesses to do so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: He knows clubs are 4-4, and he may well infer the rest of the count of the hand.  Also, would Gitelman have bid 3@C on a 4-bagger with no shape?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|kit: can't he just set up the hearts?|pg||
nt|psyck: they wull play another @d after @h played now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still 4 losers|pg||
nt|kit: but danger of being tapped again.  so he may have to take first round spade finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: keeps 4 losers|pg||
nt|kit: king of clubs, club ruff, heart?  No, I guess he still gets stuck in his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: finesse @S and trumping 2x@D can not be combined|pg||
nt|kit: I was thinking trump 1 diamond and pitch 1 on heart -- but then he can't get back, and gets overruffed on fourth heart|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: so a push|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|migry: J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe in that case same problem getting off dummy after learning about trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too tough for me|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|s4|nt|swanson: This establishes the 6 for a winner.  A diamond by North was much better.|pg||

nt|migry: David Burn Is saying "1NT forcing, 3@c raise in something (spades or diamonds)"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)  he was chatting with me about board 25|pg||
nt|swanson: Many of us use obscure 2nd and third round bids that don't make the convention card - this must be one for North SOuth.|pg||

nt|swanson: The South hand would look a lot better (and offer a decent play for game) if the @CJ was moved into the diamond suit.|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg is considering a diamond shift.  He is concerned that partner may be endplayed at some point.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will just set up spade suit, but is in danger of losing 1 diamond, 2 hearts, 2 spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: other room doesn't have scores for 17 & 18    i don't know if they've played the new boards or not|pg||
nt|swanson: Willenken will have to decide what to play now; partner is less likely to have shifted if hearts were not safe to lead now.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and since !QH denied @HJ   safety comes from length|pg||
nt|swanson: 17 and 18 were thrown out because the Norway pair was late getting to the table in the other room and might have heard the results for the Internet.|pg||
nt|swanson: from|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but our table played a new set of boards   that was our big delay a while back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by the time they finish this match, our table will have played 18 boards|pg||

nt|psyck: 4@c was intended to show shape for possible higher level sac|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+ ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: expect N  to pas|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so not so easy now to find 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember they played 32 out of order|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  0-2@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: which means Al?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: abt 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6+@D with 3@S would bid something else    3@D denies 3-card fit in @S|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh  operator will enter result from 32 after we finish this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and there goes a lot of the pickup from last hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: play of final 16 boards  starts  10 minutes past the hour    approx 35 minutes|pg||

nt|jaapfr: but i assure you they wil not open 1NT on 29|pg||
mb|1D|nt|psyck: i ain't betting on that :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: still the Dutch their first imp after 14 boards|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: to score|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|swanson: If the vulnerability were reversed would you consider a preemptive 3@H bid over West's double?|pg||
nt|kit: most probably wouldn't overcall on the North hand, but with South being a passed hand South won't bid too much without good heart support|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psyck: jump cues are often played as mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|psyck: showing about 6-9 points & 4 trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Moss may well find a Q-bid here and get them to slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will it keep them out of slam?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H bid|pg||
nt|kit: if anything it may propel them to slam -- Gitelman knows Moss is short in hearts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some followers of Larry Cohen would bid 3@H regardless|pg||
nt|kit: here it is -- and I think Gitelman will drive it to slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me Gitelman might have taken some kind of probe for a grand.  How could it cost?  6@D wouldn't run away from him.|pg||
nt|psyck: noth had no @h wastage & sources of tricks...|pg||
nt|psyck: *both|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psyck: if E's negative double limited his hand, not exploring from grand ok|pg||
