nt|jaapfr: ic here a simple 4@S C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bernix: a 20/20 deal usually leads to a partscore battle (or a pass-out)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this would not be everyones choice to open 2 @S |pg||
nt|baldfriede: third time lucky: http://www.youtube.com/thesportshubchannel|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bernix: with no long suits this will be passed out on 1-level|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and even if you disagree i will insist:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|baldfriede: looks like a coffee hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwi_joker: I think the benefit of getting a 6-card suit to the K10 across to pd, even with the drawback of jxxx in hearts on the side, makes 2@S fairly popular.|pg||
