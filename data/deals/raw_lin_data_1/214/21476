mb|p|mb|1D|nt|swanson: No.  THe barter system was in use when I played.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Zmud99: ok - they now play from board 19 - boards 17-18 will be cancel in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 17 & 18 are being thrown out because one of the Norweigan players arrived late to Open Room|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|swanson: The play wasn't given on 18 but declarer was certain to make his contract - either major would work.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: P-1@D-DBL-1N // 2@D - P - P - P|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe someday  BBO will have function so operator can just INSERT one PASS instead of having to UNDO back to the beginning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to make opening lead because of this :(|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg might have bid 1@S after North's takeout double, E-W wouldn't arrive in 2@S anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  East playing 3N|pg||

nt|jaapfr: true specs IF W X 2@S then indeed a telphone boodown in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|swanson: Probably lost two diamonds, two hearts and a club.  |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: what does Malinowski do?|pg||
nt|swanson: Responding to 1@D is a dubvious idea.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can North sit the DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the @S holding is nice, but the rest looks bad |pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT looks sound to me.  His minors are very soft to be sitting for the double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i  forgot that sometimes 2N is natural |pg||
nt|swanson: If he does sit, the AJ7 of spades in dummy will be quite disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it makes sense to use 2N as a scramble too|pg||
nt|swanson: Partner must have clubs and hearts for the double - 2NT natural is most logical.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Charlsen didn't realize he was supposed to bid with Willenken hand  [over 1@C] |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if 2@c was alerted|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pretty aggressive bidding:)|pg||
nt|psyck: E must have shown an invitaional hand with 5 @s's, & West accepted the try|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: North made it clear that his notrump bid was natural.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now   what does Rosenberg lead     was anything easy here after the opening bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H lead very helpful|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: in other room  Sontag scrambles into 2@D South|pg||
nt|swanson: I have some sympathy for this exuberant looking bid. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row    2@D for USA vs  3N for Norway|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and most cards well placed it is declarer to be favorite here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: and probably 2nd hand in a row where USA plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club and 3 diamonds.  Perhaps if West doesn't lead a club (when in with a heart) he will win an extra minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event is by invitation only   4 6-person teams each in Open and Women's  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open:  China  Netherlands  Norway  USA    Women: China England France USA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: this creates a losing option|pg||
nt|psyck: the communication problems mean he needs to find @dk play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we will see often today the Dutch safe bidding and the usa team very aggressive (regrding the score)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psyck: a tough call & W correctly takes his time for the best play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i think the invitees [except for China Open]  all from countries that have recent win in World Championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Originally Italy was going to play in the Open   When they withdrew  Netherlands entered as newly crowned Bermuda Bowl winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to know what it's like to win a Bermuda Bowl --- read John's book :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|swanson: The @S5 on the first trick wasn't very informative.  |pg||
nt|swanson: Also if you want to know what it's like to finish last.|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg is making all the right plays.  The defense now has 2 spades, 2 hearts and a club coming.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CT the vital entree|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: was @S9 [or 8] better here?  or is this a count situation with @S3?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|swanson: Now a spade and then a club will set the contract two tricks.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: still 5 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Malinowski wasn't so far off the mark with 3NT. |pg||
nt|swanson: Defense to notrump contract is frequently difficult (if not impossible) with all the defender's high cards in one hand|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed Davis (expert from SOuthern California) played against ROsenberg and his wife in the recent Nationals.|pg||
nt|swanson: Michael psyched 1C with a strong 3-5-3-2 hand, declared 3NT - Ed didn't find a club lead holding AKXX and Rosenberg took all the tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed's partner, Jill Meyers held QJxxx of clubs.  |pg||
nt|swanson: They met again later in the tournament and Rosenberg blanked a king - Ed misguessed and finessed into him.|pg||
nt|swanson: Losing all of the remaining tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: We have no information on why the play has been delayed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is either great tribute to Rosenberg  or  harsh dig of Ed|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed is my best partner - a superb played.  Just shows how you can get had by anothe great player.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China off to early 14-0 lead against Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delay is that  new boards 17 & 18 are in play  and not available to vugraph operator|pg||
nt|migry: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the original 17 & 18 had to be thrown out because one of the Norweigan players arrived late to Open Room|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg, I don't believe, would consider psyching 1C in an IMP game, but it matchpoints stealing is the rule.|pg||
nt|swanson: HI Migry.|pg||
nt|swanson: If we get one more we can start a table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry -- well rested after sticking around for final session yesterday?  your 05:30, my 03:30|pg||

nt|ahollan1: North-South not playing support dbl??   if not, what about 2@H?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room doesn't have scores for 17 & 18    i don't know if they've played the new boards or not|pg||
nt|swanson: Willenken will have to decide what to play now; partner is less likely to have shifted if hearts were not safe to lead now.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and since !QH denied @HJ   safety comes from length|pg||
nt|swanson: 17 and 18 were thrown out because the Norway pair was late getting to the table in the other room and might have heard the results for the Internet.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Brink might also overcall 1NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = natural invite|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: I am told 1NT would have been artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|psyck: yes , 1N normal enough (15-18 bal), but Europeans double more often & this pair plays Raptor anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: E-W may be propelled into 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pressure bid from rosenberg -- but the pressure is on HIS side|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  In the women's match between France and USA 4@H made when West allowed East to get squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|psyck: Raptor 1NT shows 4 in other major & 5+ in a minor|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: 4@H makes with queen of diamonds dropping doubleton|pg||

nt|kit: Declarer might have misguessed the play in diamonds from the takeout double, but he won't misguess now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|swanson: I don't see the merit of 5@C.  It won't trouble the opponents who know they hold a lot of aces, and partner might think that you actually hold some values.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: still the Dutch their first imp after 14 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: to score|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson: If the vulnerability were reversed would you consider a preemptive 3@H bid over West's double?|pg||
nt|kit: most probably wouldn't overcall on the North hand, but with South being a passed hand South won't bid too much without good heart support|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: jump cues are often played as mixed raise in competition|pg||
nt|psyck: showing about 6-9 points & 4 trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Moss may well find a Q-bid here and get them to slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will it keep them out of slam?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H bid|pg||
nt|kit: if anything it may propel them to slam -- Gitelman knows Moss is short in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some followers of Larry Cohen would bid 3@H regardless|pg||
nt|kit: here it is -- and I think Gitelman will drive it to slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
nt|kit: Seems to me Gitelman might have taken some kind of probe for a grand.  How could it cost?  6@D wouldn't run away from him.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The redouble caused the disaster. Either you ignore the double and bid a forcing 1@S, or you redouble and bid 1@S next, which is forcing when preceded by a redouble|pg||
