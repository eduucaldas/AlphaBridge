nt|clinch: I have an excellent record in this competition - last year the team I'm in lost to the eventual winners (Gillis); this year we lost to Lee. Much earlier on, of course!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play a diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: hi Marshall|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: and Christine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: 3H is a nice picture bid with 6LTC andconcentration. probably shows a bit less over double than over pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS will  have to take all their tricks (clubs) alertly or a swing will go to Allfrey|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Andrew will surely play queen here?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona: south makes a modern response of one heart...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Ace of @S lead at the other room  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile 4H only goes down on ruff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: queen there could have been disastrous as S could get a spade ruff with correct NS timing, but doubtless W was not tempted into any such indiscretion given the auction|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dkkello:  hard to find 9 tricks here?  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: oops|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart signal understandable as S will usually have just 4 of them, but this could blow the ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ten of spades i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but it looks like W is afraid of 4-1 diamonds. still cant do anything better than play a second trump though, with spades 32, or maybe am missing somehting|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: if it is modern to respond with 10 1/2 LTC, no hand and no suit, then i am antediluvian|pg||

nt|marlowepi: will change my screen-name to TRex|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N willl have 2 chances to find club switch, though even a spade now will beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: He knows from explanations she is unlikely to have 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a way this sort of misguess by declarer is a good thing, because if it was always down 200 then it is better for foes to be gnashing teeth over the 500 they could have had, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if it was due to a signal gone awry|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: East's name is Patterson, operator :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will be interesting to see if 6D is reached in other room on that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: a instead of e|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Kelsey Petterson was an american international of yore|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: East playing a strong club so opens his singleton|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: EW got away with some extremely frisky -- and anti-Law, let us note -- bidding in the other room on that one, bringing a sizeable IMP harvest to Hinden team|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: this is Derek Patterson, so many e's in the first name that they spilled into surname:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Sorry!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: although the E hand has some flaws for a 1N opener, the third spade makes that action attractive. there is play for game facing as little as:  AJxxxx   x   JT9   xxx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wilkinsona: once again not clear NS on same wavelength here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: They've had a chat about it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: glad we arent seeing auctions from the Brass Cup :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well missed the 12 card fit after the short diamond opener|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wires seem crossed here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: conditions of contest permit system discussion before play, but it is easy to forget agreements|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and wests inaction on 9 in OR hard to understand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this lead W may scamper home|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: so with only one and half boards gone match going Alfrey's way|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N awfully heavy for 1N, but the heart holding is compressed amd only one ace is held, and od is a passed hand and NS are not vul, so understandable conservatism since no ...|pg||

nt|yo_yo: interesting to have the boards played at the same time|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the Channel, anyway)? and yet it could turn out badly by getting the play in S hand (still down on club ace lead of course, but less obvious than from E hand)|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  who Â´s got a calculato?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  r|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: however if E leads spade ace, W can discourage to fetch a club shift|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has an endplay against E (loser on loser in black suits) to guarantee overtrick once hearts come in, but as it happens he doesnt need it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky 12 now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suspect S wont duck this:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless EW lead rusinow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E had Ax of clubs and spade king, ducking this would go down in cold contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, sorry suppose thats right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly 12 are there with open cards, yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we began this set a few scant boards ago, the match was nearly even. now margin beginning to yawn wider (though we are not), at least for the moment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual, the bidding has been the decisive factor  -- almost the only factor, actually. declarer coups get the headlines, but bidding wins and loses matches. a bit like the golf ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: adage "drive for show, putt for dough"|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we may have lost contact here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: friendly layout makes a game, in fact a slam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: a big 9@D, wonder what that is|pg||

nt|yo_yo: smith peter?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  think so Katrh ..|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: fortunately for S his biggest heart spot is only the 8 so not possible to go wrong in trumps|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dkkello:  nobody really have good agrements how to bid hands like this ..|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: Take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N has enough to RD (if that is natural), but at these colors short in spades it is a bit dangerous since that call invites E to preempt in spades|pg||

nt|dkkello:  can he bid more?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends what 2@D showed i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 8 tricks but W will have to discrad twice and won't enjoy it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: low diamond at Trick 2 would have been better|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: with me it's stronger that what Gold has|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E might have ducked again, won 3rd D and run trumps, hoping for error|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: due to delicate entry position, perhaps a diamond to the jack would have been better|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: this still looks -1 for a flat board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was hoping W had heart KQ, as then he could build a trick in that suit while not compromising anything. club to queen would have left taht suit one lead away from wide open. but ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: of bidding. natural 2C is off to a healthier start|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: unless 2H guaranteed six of them, maybe N could bid 5S over 4N holding extra length and quite a good suit, since S has shown support|pg||

nt|vugraphzsw: It did show 6|pg||

pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: tyvm operator|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rather eccentric 1N opener, but clearly W wants to press the advantage. stiff queen is a reasonably good holding for NT (certainly better than stiff ace), but the hand does sort of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: scream for a 1H opening under normal circumstances. here 1N effectively shut out the spades, though maybe NS were never going to bid anyway|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: so nothing systemic that would help explain the 6N call|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: or this play!|pg||
mc|13|nt|vugraphzsw: It was alerted at the table the explanation came later|pg||
