nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to make opening lead because of this :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|swanson: Probably lost two diamonds, two hearts and a club.  |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: what does Malinowski do?|pg||
nt|swanson: Responding to 1@D is a dubvious idea.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can North sit the DBL??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the @S holding is nice, but the rest looks bad |pg||
nt|swanson: 2NT looks sound to me.  His minors are very soft to be sitting for the double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh i  forgot that sometimes 2N is natural |pg||
nt|swanson: If he does sit, the AJ7 of spades in dummy will be quite disappointing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it makes sense to use 2N as a scramble too|pg||
nt|swanson: Partner must have clubs and hearts for the double - 2NT natural is most logical.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Charlsen didn't realize he was supposed to bid with Willenken hand  [over 1@C] |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|swanson: North made it clear that his notrump bid was natural.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now   what does Rosenberg lead     was anything easy here after the opening bid?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Sontag scrambles into 2@D South|pg||
nt|swanson: I have some sympathy for this exuberant looking bid. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row    2@D for USA vs  3N for Norway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: and probably 2nd hand in a row where USA plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can win 2 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club and 3 diamonds.  Perhaps if West doesn't lead a club (when in with a heart) he will win an extra minor suit trick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event is by invitation only   4 6-person teams each in Open and Women's  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open:  China  Netherlands  Norway  USA    Women: China England France USA|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i think the invitees [except for China Open]  all from countries that have recent win in World Championship|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Originally Italy was going to play in the Open   When they withdrew  Netherlands entered as newly crowned Bermuda Bowl winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to know what it's like to win a Bermuda Bowl --- read John's book :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|swanson: The @S5 on the first trick wasn't very informative.  |pg||
nt|swanson: Also if you want to know what it's like to finish last.|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg is making all the right plays.  The defense now has 2 spades, 2 hearts and a club coming.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was @S9 [or 8] better here?  or is this a count situation with @S3?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: still 5 imps|pg||
nt|swanson: Malinowski wasn't so far off the mark with 3NT. |pg||
nt|swanson: Defense to notrump contract is frequently difficult (if not impossible) with all the defender's high cards in one hand|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed Davis (expert from SOuthern California) played against ROsenberg and his wife in the recent Nationals.|pg||
nt|swanson: Michael psyched 1C with a strong 3-5-3-2 hand, declared 3NT - Ed didn't find a club lead holding AKXX and Rosenberg took all the tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed's partner, Jill Meyers held QJxxx of clubs.  |pg||
nt|swanson: They met again later in the tournament and Rosenberg blanked a king - Ed misguessed and finessed into him.|pg||
nt|swanson: Losing all of the remaining tricks.|pg||
nt|swanson: We have no information on why the play has been delayed.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is either great tribute to Rosenberg  or  harsh dig of Ed|pg||
nt|swanson: Ed is my best partner - a superb played.  Just shows how you can get had by anothe great player.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China off to early 14-0 lead against Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delay is that  new boards 17 & 18 are in play  and not available to vugraph operator|pg||
nt|migry: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the original 17 & 18 had to be thrown out because one of the Norweigan players arrived late to Open Room|pg||
nt|swanson: Rosenberg, I don't believe, would consider psyching 1C in an IMP game, but it matchpoints stealing is the rule.|pg||
nt|swanson: HI Migry.|pg||
nt|swanson: If we get one more we can start a table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Migry -- well rested after sticking around for final session yesterday?  your 05:30, my 03:30|pg||
