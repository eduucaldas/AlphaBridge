mb|p|nt|odysseus69: lst stanza finished with a slam so back to back slams|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: grand slam in hearts      likely to get to 6|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Maybe tough to bid the slam|pg||

nt|ady: once there is no heart loser  13 tricks  with just 1 diamond ruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: expext 2 spades|pg||

pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: or simply raise showing diamond shortage- 3h was pusillanimous|pg||
nt|clinch: Allerton getting shy about  his opening bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, a big opportunity for Allfrey to cut into the lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  East was rather pessimistic|pg||
nt|ady: limited the hand with 2@H    could be more agressive after 2@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe West could give it 1 more try with 4C|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: some would try 1N with S hand, some 2C, but the vulnerability doesnt exactly scream for a busy bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  The 2@H bid here shows both majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H probably both majors in a specified strength-range below GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsw: Welcome back to stanza 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: 5 spades 4 Hearts weak|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  since the 1@D opening doesn't promise diamonds (IIRC) this shows both minors|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: W may RD now, as he has a very good "weak" hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or he may oass:)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  North decided to take his chances but it's not doing ot be easy to beat 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes i think the 2@s bid was misunderstood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the heart fit came to light and W ostensibly made a game try via 2S, E bid a very surprising 3H. True that he had only 10 HCP, but he has a mountain of a hand facing a GT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsw: Crouch thought he had a singleton diamond and short clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Geoff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the pressure getting to them|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont like the choice much at these colors, and not keen on going for a ruff with natural trump tricks. weakness of the spades is a big concern for passing the X also|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pjs_ch:  it coudl be imporant to cash the clubs now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  North has seen his partner play the lowest two possible diamonds on the first two rounds - surely a club signal|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: not that he needed a signal to know clubs was the hope of the defense|pg||

nt|roswolf: a solid plus for aalfrey|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  there are 3 top losers here and after that lead declarer can't stop a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W somewhat endplayed on lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much going Irens way today|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  opening a weak two with 7cds happens fairly often, when the urge to bid conflicts with the concern about 3@H/3@S being too risky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at least since beginning of preceding set|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but it can be difficult for partner to judge|pg||

nt|marlowepi: offense-to-defense ratio for the worse|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  that's 9 tricks on a fairly normal auction and they had the same result in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 of spades was not a well-chosen card, i fear. 8 would have been clearer|pg||
nt|roswolf: made in the other room as well!!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: Allfrey having a devil of a time scoring IMPs. |pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@h is also a transfer|pg||

nt|marlowepi: seem, and here the excellent +600 (excellent against oar) is just a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pjs_ch:  EW here have a style of openign very loght, and their 1@D bid hardly promises anything - coudl even be a void|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the force is with LEE|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: e/w will feel they have possibly missed a slam here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pjs_ch:  2@D here sets up a game force; says nothing about any suit, and the 2@H response is natural, shwoing four|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would surely open that E hand at these colours, but it would be 1H. main point of opening such a hand is to draw the lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  now when he bids 3N, he must have 5 spades or he would just have raised directly to 3N; this gives his partner the chocie fo contracts|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well but they wont think it is a swing away, as they surely believe about  17|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  but the diamond suit in dummy with worry West as he knows declarer has the @DA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point has been made several times today that singleton ace is not a good holding for a NT call, in contrast to stiff king or queen. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: raising spades tempting but S has a billion losers, |pg||
nt|roswolf: well 4@s seemed inevitable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure, one way or the other|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pjs_ch:  Crocuh Paterson lead the Q from a strong KQT9 holding or a QJ-high holding, so if East had the jack he's have played it under the Q|pg||

nt|marlowepi: S hand a legitimate chance (not as cards lie) by cashing both red aces then playing spade ace and spade. if hearts are 44 and spades 33, defense after taking their fourth trick ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must lead a minor. then if Ds 33 and clubs also with Q onside, there would be no defence. S  correctly gauged that the hearts were  53|pg||

nt|roswolf: there it is though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would be well-advised on the actual layoff to bid diamonds again, but probably wont with the known heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  but not today :)|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now north is enormous|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: that is very wet imo by north|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pjs_ch:  This is a tight contract, and being forced early doesn't suit declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pjs_ch:  NS here leading 3rd & 5th in partner's suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the auction he can assume D ace onside, and on the lack of club lead he can assume N does not have a stiff. so he can  play 2 trumps and then a low club|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  Bakhshi can place partner with the @HK and one other high card. If the @DK he might need to cash quickly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really? 3 aces are nice, but it is not much above a minimum double, and all S has done is force to game|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: 2 top trumps in hand i mean|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pjs_ch:  he'll find out by cashing the @DA and seeing partner's signal, but he'lll have eased declarer's problems too|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  no @DK so back to hearts|pg||
mc|12|nt|marlowepi: not entirely eased|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict the line i have recommended|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  true - if declarer draws trumps he has a heart to lose if the @CK is offside.  He might play clubs before all the trumps are drawn to allow for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont agree if south can fore to game WITHOUT 3ACES..............|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another opportunity to Allfrey for a slam swing (or big penalty), let's see if they can find this slam in other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: SEE YOU IN 10 MINS OR SO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: KQJxx   x   xxx  KQxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6C makes facing that, but not obvious how one gets there. N is just protecting the lead|pg||
