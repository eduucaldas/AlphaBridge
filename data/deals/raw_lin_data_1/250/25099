mb|p|mb|4C|nt|spooky: 3N=Solid 7+minor indeed |pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: no alert for 4C|pg||
nt|spooky: Michielsen trying to show her majors with 4@C..|pg||
mb|4D|nt|spooky: South trying to tell he has some extra's|pg||
nt|spooky: 5@D can be made, but he needs to guess wich finesse to take.. |pg||
nt|spooky: or to play for @CK to drop..|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: if he reads 4C as majors... not so hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: dekkers: I think I should have alerted 4C|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzbn: he'll make it easily|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|spooky: at the other table it was played by North, and he got a @C lead, that made life really easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: @h 8 asks for a shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: partner knows that east has the heart king|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: so she uses her signal to ask for a spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: or perhaps it is count?|pg||
nt|spooky: 3N denied an A or King outside the minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: either, at least not attitude|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: if west continues with the heart queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: should east overtake and play a third?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dA|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: Wackwitz has plenty of entries to dummy to ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but it doesn't seem right|pg||
nt|spooky: If south trusts East having @SK, he will finesse in @C, otherwise Michielsen would have opened|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
