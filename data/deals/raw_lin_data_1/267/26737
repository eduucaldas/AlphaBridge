pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s will score well here|pg||
mc|9|nt|Alan1719:  1 off looks a very normal result to me. Maybe 40% to EW?|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many tables 35!?|pg||
nt|ady: needed to duck the spade  and take first round finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|ady: then can make 5 trump tricks with 1 spade ruff  3 clubs  1 spade and 1 diamond    |pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Yes. 70 pairs so 35 tables|pg||
nt|eggy: yes - it was hovering between 35 and 37 all week, but a few mishaps reduced the field size.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah we have 2 of our esteemed commentator colleagues|pg||
nt|eggy: indeed - they are dreading the next two rounds I'm told|pg||
nt|roswolf: now as e/w should be interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Time for just unrestrained abuse presumably?|pg||
nt|eggy: If you look at the score on http://www.brenning.se/results/2013/london/tgrs4thauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub4thauctionpairs-session2.htm|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that a little tender understanding may be needed :)|pg||

nt|eggy: Well I'mm afraid that Mssrs Burn and Lewis have been a bit slow on the previous round|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   looks a make   |pg||
nt|eggy: Perhaps due to foreboding|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@c looks the spot|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm now for a slam auction|pg||
nt|eggy: I wonder though if there are some occarsions in which you could create a poisition|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|Alan1719:  Really tricky to identify that East has all 3 of the magic queens. I shall be interested in anybody gets there and knows about it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a n/s sac|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the @s barrage may help|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
mc|13|nt|roswolf: west i think should bid 4@s instead of the final pass|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  I said a grand was difficult. I have sympathy with West here. Why can partner not have a flat 0 count?|pg||
nt|eggy: Lewis has a couple of cards, but still - does it seriously look enough - maybe after the spade bid and raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think so steve|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Though maybe you have to bid 4S over 4H. Very unlucky to go off in 5H if partner has nothing.|pg||
nt|mikesl: How about a 4H bid from East after the 3S raise?  Is this possible?|pg||
nt|eggy: Marshall said where he comes from this is a hand too good to just bid 4H over 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west gave too much respect to the opps barrage|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Yes I was wondering about that. It would certainly perk things up.|pg||
nt|mikesl: Does East's actual auction promise MORE than an immediate 4H bid?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west could also bid 4@c instead of dbl|pg||
nt|eggy: DB would have needed to know that, because even with a 3 loser hand, you feel daft venturing to the 5 level and going light|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps he preferred x because of the vulnerability - |pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Not with this pair. If you bid it shows values, passing shows nothing|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but ignoring opps is a good principle|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now a mixed pair challenges our dear friends|pg||
nt|eggy: Just one pai bid the grand (in clubs)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcw: The second Bertheau to come to the table today, her husband was here earlier|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many missed the slam altogether steve?|pg||

nt|roswolf: but south cant bid any more surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no doubt another sequence to discuss at the bar|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|ady: had a similar mix up earlier    north may have tht his 3 diamonds was a hheart transfer as far as south is concerned   so hearts may be the wrong spot    but they have ended up ok  ...|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|eggy: unless some EWs fail to cash their CA I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzcw: surely unlikely when it is played this way up as East will play a @C when in with K@S?|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|nt|eggy: and getting it|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Well they made short work of the bidding - Now you have to make it.|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead makes 13 tricks awkward   removing an entry for the spades   but 8@D singleton means an extra entry |pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this makes it easier|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|eggy: but on a trup lead has enough entries to establish the spades|pg||

nt|eggy: not that we would probably have found it|pg||

mb|r!|an|bid your suit|nt|eggy: in two languages that I don;t fully understand :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|Alan1719:  This pair are French. Are they allowed to open weak twos on 5 card suits? What is the world coming to?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|Alan1719:  Elinescu as usual leaving nothing unbid.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: may bring this down 2|pg||
nt|po-s: the club four must be very clear...|pg||
nt|ady: might make 3@C  if taking a peep and droping doubleton queen|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Yes it is a very odd card isn't it P-O (well it is even actually but you know what I mean)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: trump now  can be left with 3 club losers  1 heart and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps odd-even signals|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Well whatever it meant South got it right.|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  I thought of odd-even signals, but is the 4 right even then? Unless it was supposed to suggest hearts?|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  This looks booked for down 2 now.|pg||
nt|po-s: one can´t play odd-even signals - discards, yes|pg||

nt|Alan1719:  Yes I have come acroos a few who play odd even signals. If you don't have the right parity of card you sit and think for a while before playing your card <grin>|pg||
mc|7|nt|eggy: so you barrack room lawyers can get briefed up on it :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I meant bridgewise. Whatever rules may say one can not possibly choose to play odd-even to the first trick|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Last round coming up|pg||
nt|eggy: Last round - thanks to P-O david and Alan for making this session so entertaining|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  And the dealing machine for some entertaining hands.|pg||
