mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are using transfer response to a prepared 1@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 1@s does not actully show spades|pg||
nt|jackthelad: and the Scots are 2/1 ish with gazzilli and stuff :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  showed diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|yorkbeach:  so 2@s is the second suit for West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with a weaker hand West would have just shown the spades (via 1@h)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT and 5@d are both makeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|jackthelad: even on a @h lead declarer has the tempo|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has hearts stopped but also better diamond support than he might|pg||
