It was more important information that North did not hold a 4-card major. As you see the declaring side has 12 cards in the majors and 14 in the minors.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|BroLucius:  North transfers into diamonds. It would not have been safe to look for a heart fit 'on the way', because he would then have no safe sign-off if a fit was not found.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Most pairs make good use of the fact that the opener has two bids available, 3@C and 3@D. They use one to show a diamond fit, the other to deny.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  My wife brought me a tea and (yes!) a chocolate digestive biscuit.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4D|nt|BroLucius:  East bids the higher of North's indicated suits to show a sound raise in diamonds (Unusual v Unusual, the convention is called).|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  It is usual to play the higher bid as agreeing partner's suit, since you already have a fit. 2@H would show clubs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|BroLucius:  6D is possible. You need to set up the clubs to discard a spade or two. Also, to pick up the trumps.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with 3 aces and 3 trumps, Simpson may raise|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ady: 3-0 diamond split makes life a little harder on a heart lead     1 entry gone  from east    but with clubs 3-3  should be ok    spade lead more awkward|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  tempeting for N to take insurance|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  North has various bids to indicate the quality of his heart raise, 2@H, 3@H, 2@C and 3@C (some also use 2NT to show a 4-card raise).|pg||
nt|carrott: where in Ireland will the 2nd weekend be held?|pg||
