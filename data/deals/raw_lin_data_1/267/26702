nt|paulg:  but when it is the setting trick, ducking is wrong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: followed by drury by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Welcome to Tony Wilkinson, Alex's father and a previous Camrose partner for him|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless an undo to come|pg||
nt|paulg:  Our operator is struggling with undo's, a perennial problem on BBO when the internet connection is not perfect. |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2N|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  so we need to undo back to the start of the auction as West opened 1@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless south is playing 3 clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the problem for our operator is that a key press gets missed |pg||
nt|paulg:  well, we have the right contract although the auction will need interpretation by historians|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however the contract is right now, if not the auction|pg||
pc|sA|mc|13|nt|paulg:  it is likely that North is declarer|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|paulg:  although perhaps -2 is right|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: diamond does the trick now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it does, but far from clear|pg||
nt|paulg:  East does not know much about the hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  he knows his partner has an even number of clubs, but could be 2 or 4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep after the NT east may think it unlikely partner holds the ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  he doesn't know the trump position|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond works because East gets to make his @sJ on a trump promotion|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  but he would need to cash the @hA before getting the second diamond through|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the other hand, he would have considered if there was any layout where he can defeat the contract|pg||

nt|paulg:  @d6?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  East-West play Polish 2/4 leads|pg||
