nt|ady: e/w may get to 4 hearts  which can be dfeated with a diamond ruff   and 2 club tricks  as well as A@D of course|pg||
nt|Henryb:  The movement is a Howell, and rather than feature the stationary table, the "turnaround" table is shown, so each pair plays two rounds here|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Thor-Erik Hoftaniska is Norwegian but not lives in London. Peter Bertheau is of course one of the reigning Swedish world champions and widely regarded as one of teh trickiest opponents in the world. |pg||
