nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
mb|1C|mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: Morning :)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S is a make unless a heart lead from west and underplay AKQ diamonds for another heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: a nice friendly hand to get the players settled for the weekend :)|pg||
nt|ady: got higher than that quickly|pg||
nt|athene: you would beat 5@D with a trump lead?|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure Snall will lead a heart   but defence will settle for down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|athene: or a trump shift after cashing a club or two|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: nasty decision for south over 5@D, but you need huge offence to bid 5 over 5; not sure 6322 really qualifies|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: well Small wont lead|pg||
nt|athene: but one advantage of "bidding one more" in competition is that even when it's objectively wrong, sometimes opps take the push|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|ady: 1@H transfer to spades|pg||

nt|athene: it might have got slightly interesting on a trump lead (but not very interesting)|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer led hearts from hand north could get in twice more to play two more rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but if he led a heart from dummy he would prevent that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: and if the defence forced him to build a club trick, he could not go wrong there anyway|pg||

nt|athene: either works; the only thing that doesn't is the chinese finesse of running the 10, which deserves to fail :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: south might have considered doubling 1@H for takeout, as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|athene: but perhaps that is being a bit busy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|athene: i was assuming 1@D was alerted because it guarantees an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H looks an excellent spot    but may fail as long as A@S not led|pg||
mb|3H!|an|GF- "RKCB"|nt|athene: ah i am told 1@D = natural or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|ady: or a club |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|an|2 w/o Q|nt|athene: i guess in this auction the west hand is getting described, not the east hand|pg||
nt|athene: will south worry about pitches on diamonds, and lead the @SA?|pg||
nt|ady: if a diamond is led  declarer may try for a spade ruff  and then there is a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: or will she decide that her partner might have a decent diamond holding, and go passive?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|an|King of trumps?|mb|p|mb|4N|an|Nope|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|athene: i don't think south will lead a singleton, with an ace in her hand :)|pg||
nt|ady: might lead a psssive trump|pg||
nt|athene: terence reese said something like "people who lead a singleton against six with an ace in their hand should be studied closely, but not emulated"|pg||

nt|athene: 6@H could have been interesting on another lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: for example on a diamond lead you might draw trumps and knock out the @SK and then squeeze north in spades and diamonds?|pg||

nt|roswolf:  yup - they need to be realistic |pg||
nt|dburn: double may cause East to proceed with more caution, since he will downgrade his black suit holdings|pg||
nt|roswolf:  north will preempt in @s now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: slam is good (6NT by East best) because of the red-suit jacks, not easy to locate|pg||
nt|roswolf:  mini- prempt|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf:  ah east uses science|pg||
nt|dburn: but Selway just bidding Blackwood - he does have a twenty count facing a second-seat opening|pg||

nt|athene: even if south had doubled, showing the black suits, rather than bidding 1@S, west's rebid is going to shut north out from showing his clubs|pg||
