nt|woozle:  yes, thanks everyone for tuning in|pg||
nt|ady: thx operator  and spex|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|pdjourdain:  bye from Patrick jourdain|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|woozle:  Malinowsky will probably reach and make 3NT - four diamonds, two spades, two clubs and a heart on the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|ady: 3NT makes on a heart lead   and can make on a spade lead  id playing clubs for 3 tricks  queen first    not easy|pg||
nt|woozle:  Alas for the Hacketts, NS in the other room, Justin tried for an endplay line and drifted down one|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Can make but might assume @C king offside|pg||
nt|ady: now just the simple club finesse works|pg||
nt|woozle:  I don't think he did the right thing though, since he was playing the single-suited overcall in hearts to be 4522 at the point that he exited with the heart|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: no sorry|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  East must throw spades to persuade declarer he can be endplayed|pg||
nt|woozle:  East has to keep a third spade to make the endplay a feasible line|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Or rather one spade and one heart as if he had @CKx and 3 spades|pg||
nt|woozle:  If East keeps all of his hearts, the endplay can't work|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Play has continued but we know not what happened!|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: sorry about that|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 6th trick is QC from S|pg||
nt|woozle:  No worries - we know that operating can be a tough job|pg||
nt|woozle:  Sounds like declarer took the simple line of the club finesse, which will make easily|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Looks as if he has done the right thing|pg||
nt|ady: either way a good win for Ewart|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  ewart has won all three matches comfortably and a big lead overall|pg||
pc|d3|nt|woozle:  He should have known that East had a singleton club and the endplay couldn't work|pg||
nt|woozle:  I notice that on board 20, Justin Hackett did bid 4H over south's 3S, and the slam was reached routinely after that.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D!|an|one major|nt|xenya: perhaps @H 10 from dummy instead of a small one -- then endplaying W -- yes, looks like that should work|pg||

nt|woozle:  Difficult to see anything much different to 3nt happening here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle:  Featherweight 1C opening from de Botton and a matching featherweight 1S response from Malinowski|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|woozle:  Fortunately for EW, Hallberg is on the case and there are very few 3NTs that he doesn't find|pg||
nt|woozle:  Ewart's 1NT, of course, shows something in clubs (his partner's expected short suit) but doesn't make any big promises about spades, which the takeout doubler can usually be assumed to have covered.|pg||
