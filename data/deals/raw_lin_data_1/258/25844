mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  6NT is a better contract because there is the diamond finesse as a fall back if spades do not behave|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  the 1@s rebid is used for a balanced 11-13 points, so he's preferred this small lie rather than rebidding 2@c on a poor 5-card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  at this vulnerability East it not going to sell out to 1NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  he's already shown five spades by passing 1@s, so partner should have an easy decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Love all is the most competitive vulnerability, as we see from this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  As everyone is so competitive, it is difficult to work out who really has the points so tough for anyone to double|pg||
